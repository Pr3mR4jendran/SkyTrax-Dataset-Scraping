✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Atlanta,April 2023,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,  It’s a pretty well known fact that Frontier has the most horrible customer service. Only a good airline to fly if you’re carrying nothing on you. They will make a deal out of every item you are carrying and try to make you pay for bring it on the flight.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Denver,April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,  This airline is terrible. I tried to give them a chance but each time I do my flights are delayed or cancelled. It’s not worth trying to save the money. Book with a better airline! I know I will going forward.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta,March 2023,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will never fly with this airline again. First off it cost us $280 to check 3 “carry on” bags. And that was only one way. Second, you can’t even provide free water to your passengers??They lost my sons car seat on our flight to Atlanta from Orlando ($250 car seat). We wandered back and forth between carousels for over an hour looking for his carseat. We had no choice but to drive 3.5 hours home at 1:30am with him strapped in on the seat with the regular seat belt. The guy working the frontier office at the airport told me to write down some information on a piece of paper, I didn’t even get any kind of confirmation number or anything from him. I got an email from the airline a couple days later with a number to call about our missing item. I called every day for a week, multiple times a day and left messages every day, even sent them two emails. I never heard from them still and that’s been a month ago. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Their fees are ridiculous. "

We were told we needed to see an Agent to ensure our bag would transferred to the new flight without additional fees. When I went to the Frontier ticket counter at Columbus the General Mgr told me I had to pay for my bag (AGAIN) and was very rude about the process. He charged me $79, I asked if he could charge me the same amount I originally paid ($58) and he said absolutely NOT! Because it doesn’t show in his computer system that I had paid for a checked bag. He even refused to look a my phone or at my Frontier account. I can’t believe a Manager would conduct themselves in such a manner! Never again!"

I have never had an issue on any other airline before. Every one of my Frontier flights have had issues. I have had my flight listed as on time and then cancelled while waiting to board. And now 5 minutes before boarding they delay the flight over two hours. This will be my last flight with them as you cannot contact customer support for anything. Even their chat fails. They even said the flight is delayed due to weather in Nashville which has little to no wind and no chance of rain for the entire day. They seem to have forgotten people have weather apps.

Not only was the cost of luggage ridiculous (3 bags were $263!) but the flight attendants were rude, had little knowledge of anything and seemed to goof around with each other the whole time we waited.

While boarding the plane the attendants were standing in the aisle hollering at everyone confusing everybody and making it take longer to board the plane because they are standing directly in everyone’s way. Then once we boarded they overbooked the flight and it took them like an hour to figure out if we could fit everyone, then because they took so long we got delayed 3 hours because of a storm (which would have been avoided if we could have left on time). Once on the plane the 2 flight attendants gossiped back and forth the entire flight about other co workers and how much they didn’t like certain people.  They spent so much time talking during the whole flight, nobody at the front of the plane could get any sleep if you didn’t have headphones. These were the most unprofessional flight attendants I’ve ever had. While stuck at the airport for weather we were ready to leave finally after waiting hours and the flight attendants realize that the plane is completely out of bottled water (they haven’t handed out a single water to anyone on this plane, I would know because I’m in the first row). Then attempting to get home from Orlando, I get to the airport to find out that my flight has randomly been cancelled. Do not recommend flying Frontier.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Rochester,April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Horrible. Waited in line to drop baggage off for 1.5 hours in Tampa.

They pretty much told us, ""How did other passenger came on time?"". The plane was still there. They never made any announcement for the late passengers. And they knew they had 20+ people late but decided not to care about it. Also they sent our checked-in luggages with no way to track their status."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Atlanta,April 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,3,no,1,"  Unbelievable! I understand that they are less expensive than other airlines, but they should still have a little bit of pride in their company. I flew home yesterday from Phoenix. Both of my flights were horrible. I purchased a ticket for my grandson with his caraway. I entered his age (1) and that I had a car seat. They assigned the seat both times in the middle seat. Per their policy, car seats have to be in the windows seat. Both times I had to ask someone to switch their seat so he could sit at the window. The attendants both times could care less! There were several other crazy incidents that I can’t fit in this box. Do better!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Denver,April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst airline ever. I am a frequent traveler, I had this flight because of my last minute travel plan and the flight cost was cheap too. But speaking honestly about the service this airline is unreliable, irresponsible and the employees are rude, unprofessional. I am writing this review after my second worst experience with Frontier airlines (twice in a same month). Friends never suggested me this airline, now I understand the reason. Book this flight only if you are not in rush or have nothing planned for next 32 hours. My flight was delayed three times on march 16 2023. And twice on return flight of march 18 2023. Now today again april 7, 2023 my flight is delayed then canceled. I had connecting flights which is obviously not possible at this point. This is so much frustrating and irresponsible behavior at airport I have ever seen from the frontier airlines and their employee at gates"

So when I get to Rochester and they Weigh it and move me along. I expect to have the same experience on the way back to Rochester. What I do not understand is how I had to pay for a bag that I did not add a single thing to, that somehow grew 10lbs larger. I do not understand also why the people working the counter have to be so impersonable and uncaring and stare at me like I grew twelve heads. I will never use this airline again. So I sure hope keeping my $50 was worth it when I fly a lot and could have used you guys again. I’d rather take a propeller plane. Do better."

When asking about the ridiculous slot size, I was told to fork over $99 or miss my flight. When I asked for a manager, I was told ""Sir, pay me or don't fly"". Was told to not photograph the ill-fitting box (which I did).No free water services for a 2.5+ hour flight. I was told the flight was not full and we could relocate ... when we got up to grab an unclaimed seat, I was told it would cost an additional $50 to do so.  Never again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Denver,November 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Flights are cheap and seats are very uncomfortable. Charged me $100 for a carry on the fit in the measurement tool. This company is scamming people. Absolutely 0 customer service!
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Washington via Denver,April 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I have flown a lot throughout my life, domestic and international, and this is the worst experience I’ve had thus far. I began my journey in SFO with a connecting flight to Denver with my final destination in DCA. SFO to Denver was fairly smooth. However, the last half of my journey was pure mayhem. They had delayed my flight 1.5 hours hours before even arriving in Denver, and then 30 minutes before its new departure, they cancelled the flight. Everyone scrambled to the front desk to receive new flights/be refunded. I then proceeded to wait 4 more hours for the next, which they also delayed! Finally we take off, after 8 hours of being in the Denver airport. Then the pilot struggles to land our plane to due winds. We circled for almost 45 minutes, before we finally landed. It took me almost 20 hours to arrive from the west coast to the east coast. Absolutely absurd. Also this airline nickel and dimes you for everything. Nothing is complementary, poor customer service and unreliable. I paid additional money to fly a different airline home and ate my original ticket because this experience was so bad! Invest in a better airline!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Nashville,April 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,3,no,1," Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia on 03/31 was delayed 90 minutes. That was annoying, but the flight was fine. Flight from Philadelphia to Nashville on 04/02 was on time, but ended up being one of the worst flights I've ever been on. During boarding, I commented to my husband that the entire flight crew seemed under the age of 35. They joked during announcements, which is pretty standard for budget flights these days. Overall flight wasn't bad. Some turbulence, but we made good time and arrived in Nashville early. But then we tried to land, and that's where things got bad...really bad. The pilot had to abort mid landing and go around the airport. It was abrupt and unnerving. It's a rare occurrence (estimated 1-3 in 1,000 landings), but it happens. We circled for several minutes before the pilot came on and confirmed that he had to abort (didn't explain why), and said essentially we were going to circle and land. 10-15 minutes later he tried again. On his second attempt he aborted again. After the 2nd abort, the pilot did explain that on the first approach the tower asked him to pull up because another plane was in the way, and on the second approach he didn't have enough speed to manage the wind. He encouraged us to turn on our air and that he had lowered the temperature in the cabin. Why? You may ask. Because it turns out that two aborted landings with tight pull ups and hard banks will make people sick. A lot of people. They told us to use the bags in the seat pockets. But there weren't any. Like none on the entire plane. At one point while we were circling, a man got up to ask for a bag and the flight attendant started yelling at him to sit down. He explained he needed a bag, and she just kept yelling at him. Others were shouting for bags, and no one had any. Someone several rows away managed to find a paper bag for the woman next to us, and she started puking. We were begging the flight attendants for help, and their response was that people should just pass around bags if they have any. The entire cabin is yelling back that there are no bags. Someone asked her what she wanted us to do if we needed to throw up. Do we throw up in the aisles? She got on the microphone and said she didn't feel safe getting up to find bags, so we just needed to ""do what you need to do."" At that point it got pretty quiet except for the sound of people puking. It was probably another 15 minutes for the second go around. On the third landing, we made it. The plane was dead quiet. Another flight attendant tried to break the ice by making a joke that the final attempt was ""smooth like butter"". It was not appreciated. Someone went off on him that ""he needed to know when it was a time to joke and a time to pray, and this was NOT a time to joke."" As we were trying to leave, the poor woman next to us, who had been puking into a *paper* bag for 15 minutes, stood up, and the bottom of her bag gave way. She, and the seat, and the floor were now covered in puke. We finally managed to get out and were met with a crowd of people who were already lined up to get on the plane we just got off. I hope they were delayed for cleaning. The lack of experienced flight crew turned a rough situation into a horrific situation. The pilot's inexperience likely contributed to the two aborted landings. Cleaning crew had not prepared the plane appropriately. And the attendants did not know how to diffuse a bad situation and made it much worse."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Tampa via Denver,April 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  After purchasing a ticket months in advance we were told after checking in and arriving at the gate that the flight was overbooked and we probably won’t have seats. After waiting until everyone was boarded we were finally given seats. Our connection in Denver was awful. A staff member was on a power trip and said that all of my party of 3’s back packs that we brought with us from Seattle and fit under the seats were too big and not allowed so we had to pay $99 per bag to take them onto the plane! We ended up paying $118 to check 2 bags initially then $297 to bring back packs onto the plane. So you may think you have a deal with Frontier but they will nickel and dime you for everything. It cost me $415 to get our luggage to our destination! That’s almost as much as the initial ticket. Customer service is shocking. They even charge you $3.50 for a bottle of water! I will never use Frontier Ever again and I advise anyone considering it to think twice. Pay the difference to fly an airline like Alaska where they appreciate their customers and don’t charge you for everything. It will save you money in the end!
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Washington DC via Denver,April 2023,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,1," 
First and last time on Frontier. Worst airline and rude customer service. They nickel and dime you to death. Nothing is included. Unlike any other airline that allows a carry-on, here you pay (a lot) for even a carry-on. And bring your own drinks and snacks too - you can get a cup of water. I would rather pay a little more and not be nickel and dimed to death. It isn’t any cheaper than any other airline once you pay for all the extras that are not extra anywhere else. And rude. Do not ask anyone at a counter a question or you will get rude snarky comments (such as - I just answered that for the guy in front of you! Sorry I didn’t hear what you told him, you don’t have to talk to me like I’m dirt on your shoe). And make sure you know how to check in and tag your own bag at the kiosk because any help at check-in is another $10 - I didn’t need it but seriously people? Do yourself a favor and fly another airline. Any other airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Denver,April 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  The worst airline.

Not worth it!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Miami,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Never flying this airline again, worst customer service ever. I tried to give them another chance after another screw up but this drew the line. 350 bucks for a flight and I wanted to go in and update my city of arrival. They don’t give that option and online customer service says to cancel for a credit then re book, did that and did not receive any credit. Chatted back into customer service and told me that there was nothing they could do and I was getting a cancel charge on top of losing my booking. When I asked to speak to a supervisor they stated “we understand you want to speak to a supervisor but it won’t make a difference” how could you possibly treat customers today like this. In todays world customer experience is key for customer retention, you totally lost me as a customer and I am sharing this experience with everyone. Tired of these airlines taking advantage."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,March 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Everything about my travels with Frontier airline was horrible. All but 1 or 2 of the self check in stations at Philadelphia were out of paper. My flight to Orlando was over 3 hours late for no apparent reason - the weather (the usual reason they give) was great. We lost our whole afternoon in Fl as we didn’t get in until after dinner time. The staff was abrupt and not friendly - especially the person hawking the bag drop line in Orlando who wouldn’t let people get in line while a family member went to check in and get the bag tickets. She made people get out of line until the bags had tickets on them even though the line was long and it took over 30 mins to get through it. Only 4 people were taking bags while 5 other employees stood around talking and laughing. Other stations could have been opened. And frontier charges for everything - from sodas on the flights, $25 per person if you didn’t check in in the app and need them to check you in, suitcases o we 40 lbs, to charging you for carry on bags.

She became ill on the plane and needed medical assistance. The flight attendants were completely wonderful. They paid very close attention to my daughter and moved her up to the front of the plane where a doctor and nurse happened to be. They got oxygen for her and checked on her often. They arranged for an ambulance to meet us at the airport where my daughter was taken to the Cleveland Clinic. The pilot was great as well. I was very impressed with the entire staff at Frontier.

Horrible airline and horrible customer service. You can’t call anyone and then you get this horrible automated chat. Then once you break through that you get agents who don’t help and you can tell are just reading a script. I might as well just talk to the automated system. Your guidelines unclear and when you spent time thinking you made the right decision they come out of nowhere with something that wasn’t on there. Oh but they can provide you that link if need be. I have gotten credit after credit with an airline I will NEVER fly again. Avoid at all cost. Hopefully they get shut down so we never have to be tortured by their incompetence ever again.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Cancun,March 2023,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown. They nickel and dime everything. Even though they impose the highest cost for checked luggage, they have a 40 lb weight max whereas all other airlines is 50 lbs. Their app and website are constantly breaking down. It wouldn't even allow me to purchase baggage. I finally had to call Frontier directly (never allowed me to speak with an agent) and purchase the baggage via chat. (Very cumbersome and time-consuming.) When checking in online, it took at least 10 pages and asked for information (ie., KTN and passport) that I've previously entered. Upon arrival at the airport, there were no kiosks where I can print out my own luggage tags so that I may do self-service check-in as described online. On our return flight, the app/website didn't even allow for online check-in. There were only 2 kiosks that worked for Frontier, even though there were 20+ that were available for all other airlines. The ticketing agent used fear tactics to try to force us to purchase carry-on luggage for our personal items, even though our personal items met the dimensions specified on Frontier's corporate website. When we arrived at the gate, the agent refused to help any non-Spanish speaking passengers. She literally helped 3 Spanish-speaking passengers and just left without a word to the rest of us. I couldn't believe it. The seats on both flights were hard as plywood with minimal padding and zero recline. From this point forward, we will never fly Frontier again. I'm willing to pay double for any other airline. It just isn't worth it."

The lady forcing bag measuring was unfriendly and strict. She wouldn’t even let you assist your bag into the measuring box and said it had to fall in freely. Backpacks have air inside and straps that get in the way. We’ve traveled Frontier for years with the same backpacks. My daughters favorite travel backpack had a handle that stuck out less than an inch from the box. The charge for that was $99. I couldn’t afford to pay that. They said no exceptions. Explaining to my 8 year old that we had to put her favorite bag in the trash was heart breaking. Only positive thing was the passengers sticking together and supporting each other through the trauma induced by Frontier. Once on the plane there wasn’t even water offered. Within 2 hours of the 4.5 hour flight the ran out of water for purchase. They’d bring a water in a cup if requested, but the crew seemed inconvenienced by that. I heard lots of “we’ll never choose Frontier again”."

We were advised one hour prior to the departure time that the flight would be delayed for two hours. We departed from Aguadilla by 11.00 pm and arrived at Orlando by 2.00 pm. This situation meant that my family stayed in the airport until 4.30 am. The parking where we left our car closed at 2.00 am, we got stuck two and a half hours at Orlando airport. Then we had to travel two hours and a half to our home. Because of the negligence of this airline we spent a complete night at the airport and our son got sick too. When I asked an Frontier counter employee at Aguadilla about the situation and tried to explained him, his response was that he was in there to help travelers to board the plane and he was not a direct Frontier employee. Also the baggage charges are very high comparing with the service. We chose Frontier considering flight tickets prices but when you see the baggage prices it is better to choose other carrier. Definitely this was our last travel with this airline."
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Chicago ,March 2023,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had a flight out of O'Hare on March 20th 2023, tried to do a check in and baggage online the night before with no success, arrived at the airport to be told that I would have to pay $25 check-in fee and had to pay $79 per bag. Had I been able to do it online I would have only been charged 50 to $54. On my return to O'Hare flight 81 on March 27th 2023 I needed a wheelchair which I tried to do online with no success again and still had issues trying to do check in and baggage, so had to pay $25 again for check in at the counter and $79 per bag which I had two of them so round trip I ended up paying almost $400 for checking in fees at the counter and for my bags. Ask for a wheelchair to be told my name was not on the roster well how can I do that if you can't do anything on their website, no customer service number to call only chat which is absolutely horrible so now I had to sit and wait almost 50 minutes for someone to come and transport me through customs, the seats are so uncomfortable and tight no button to recline the seats you just have to sit in an upright position, this airline is absolutely horrible and I never want to fly with them again the only good thing that I can say is that the landing was the best I've experienced. I'm not sure who the woman was at the gate but she was as helpful as she could be didn't get her name but was told that she would put in a complaint for me somehow I doubt that's never going to take place so to some the whole frontier experience up I would say just don't use a totally different carrier!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Philadelphia,March 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Do Not Fly Frontier. We were flying home from an awesome trip. We boarded the plane sat in the plane at the gate for an hour and a half before we were informed they were having issues with the plane. At 1hour 50 minutes they announced they were bringing a piece or a plane from Orlando or Denver and had us deplane. We then sat at the gate for another 45 minutes when they announced the flight was cancelled go get our checked luggage and see the Frontier desk out front. When we arrived at the desk they provided us with a business card with a QR code to scan and submit for reimbursement. The next flight out would be a day away and they could not guarantee us a seat. This was a trip we had planned for over a year and had our flights purchased months in advance. At the least they should have to compensate us for our tickets home, hotel for the night, transportation cost and food. We planned ahead but that did not matter because Frontier does not have pride in their work or appreciate their passengers. I can guarantee I will never be their customer again. When you are contracted to do something you don't just quit in the middle and not finish the project. Any other company would be held liable Frontier should be too, this was not an act of Mother Nature this was because something was wrong with their equipment. The need to be held accountable!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Washington DCA,March 2023,2.0,1.0,,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Stay away from Frontier if at all possible!! My wife's oldest friend (54 years), died of a relapse of non-smoking related lung cancer on the evening of 3/24. Funeral was 3/27 in Bethesda, MD. We live in Denver, needed to get to DCA on Sunday. Only direct non-stops with compatible timing were on Frontier. We hadn't flown Frontier in a long time, since we lived out west last time, and we remembered good experiences. A lot has changed! We chose an 11:49 flight outbound. Frontier charges extra for every single thing you want, including seat assignment, overhead or checked bags, etc., so we did not select specific seats, b/c the tickets were already over $500 each for roundtrip. And they do say on their website that if you choose not to pay for a seat assignment, one will be assigned at the gate. Turns out that that really means that they overbook, and you are in line just ahead of standbys to get seats assigned to no-shows, which fact is NOT in the online material. Sure enough, we were bumped. And they lie. At the check-in, I was assigned seat 7B, my wife got seat ZERO. When I asked what that meant, I was told ""seat will be assigned at the gate"", not ""no seat available for her yet"". After we were bumped a supervisor tried very nicely to help us out, but nothing worked. He told us not to worry about our bags (which had some essential medicines of mine inside, another mistake) - he said DCA baggage claim was open 24 hrs a day, they would be waiting patiently for us. Finally called a manager, who came over 30 minutes later, advised us to get on standby for 6 pm flight, got us seats selected, and told us per FAA policy that they would reimburse us each 4x the outbound fare, which they did. We actually did get on the 6 pm flight, made it to DCA and our hotel, and were able to get to the funeral. Review: From 7 hours at DEN watching and interacting: Frontier is trying to lower costs drastically, and they're obviously cutting as many humans and as much labor costs as possible. Which means shifting everything online, and they have totally eliminated the customer service line, so everything has to be done by chat. More on that later. They also charge more for everything you do at the airport than online. The human labor is now significantly overstretched, and they are multitasking, having to do everything from manning check-in counters to boarding flights to assisting at baggage claim to solving problems. So they are really overstretched. Many are really young, not American, not native English speakers, and seem really ignorant of what customer service means here. DCA Frontier Baggage claim is not open 24 hrs, and after de-planing we had to wait 40 minutes for someone to show-up and unlock bag storage so we could get our bags. As for the flight, the only thing you can get without paying is a cup of water. Seat depth is literally only half the length of my thigh, and I'm 5'6"", so you can see how many rows they're trying to cram in. My seat did not recline even 1/2"". And ultimately, they're not that cheaper than competition. Stay away, for your own sakes."

Coming back home, the flight was delayed again, this time citing weather. It was to be 38 minute delay and ended up being over an hour. The gate was switched but no announcement made at the original gate. An announcement was made at the new gate but was impossible to hear - I only knew because of an email I received. The woman working the gate was very rude. I had trouble with the boarding pass scanner and she literally grabbed my arm and pulled me to the side and then scolded me for going too far. Very rude. The extra charges are ridiculous. The woman behind me made a reservation for 3, for herself and two grandkids. They were not seated together. When she asked why they weren't put together, a crew member said, ""You could have reserved them all together."" Frontier used to be my favorite airline when flying to and from Denver. I will never use this airline again. I did book my flight through Cheapo Air and they were great. Oh, and when I did have a question regarding my reservation, there was no customer service EXCEPT for booking a reservation.

Dragging it off the back of the luggage cart across the asphalt. Holes clear through both bags. It's nothing short of a miracle that the clubs weren't damaged. We spent 3 weeks going around and around with Frontier's central baggage claims dept and without all of the receipts for the items from when they were originally purchased, they only will reimburse $75 per bag. Are you kidding me? Plus they changed the weight allotment on the checked bags (from 50lbs to 40lbs) conveniently just in time to charge us an extra $50 for a checked bag that was 42 lbs.  $700 in damage to my bags and items that you now want to give us $225 after charging extra baggage fees at the ticket counter.

Flying from Chicago to Orlando was a disaster, I showed up 2 hours ahead of time to check in at Frontier, there was no one at their counter, I found out later these people dont show up until a maximum one hour ahead of their flights, no one can answer questions because no one works for Frontier and their employees are no show, found out I was scheduled to fly out of Midway and not O'Hare, paid 178.00 for my bags to Chicago, paid another 99.00 to bring the bag back to Florida, had to take a 90.00 taxi ride from O'Hare to Midway and actually got there on time for the flight only to rush through the airport and find out the flight was pushed to 7.15pm instead of 3.30pm, the airplane is hot, the seats are terrible, you are definitely crammed in like sardines, and it's still something off about the service. I am confused as to how this company is in the business of flying people around the Earth, taking our lives in their hands and they don't want to speak to customers in any fashion whatsoever, I am befuddled and I will save money, get a second job to fly with a better airline or ride horse and buggy before I book with Frontier again."

What is bad about that? When you’re looking at paying thousands of dollars for tickets of course you want the best deal. That’s not bad. It’s like buying clothes off the discount rack and someone trying to make you feel like you did something wrong. They advertise green air or whatever yet when I was looking at tickets from Fayetteville, AR to Orlando, FL they wanted to fly me to Denver on a 22 hr flight before getting to FL. There was no kids fly free as advertised. Plus they were charging $679 per round trip ticket when Allegiant charged $200.

Then i said what are my options, then she replied i can give you for tomorrow evening flight (i.e. after 24hrs) or you can apply for a refund. i told her i didn't get any notification, then she said your third party agency should have informed you. Then i called Priceline they said there was information for them as Frontier don't have electronic update capability to all the ticket booking agencies. They tried conferencing Frontier but no one answer their call. Then again i went to Frontier desk, she was saying she can't help it. First of all, her attitude was so reckless no courtesy. I can understand sometimes flights get cancelled or delayed, but customer service reps will handle that so smoothly but this lady was talking on her cell phone, my understanding was she was talking to her friend (or) some family member, she don't care about a customer standing in front of her. I asked her name, but she didn't tell me. My point was not about refund or the next day flight, i already booked my hotel and reserved my Disney tickets so can't afford losing all that.

We chose to try and save money by flying with them, but ended up having to spend even more. Frontier decided to give us a ghost flight that never even existed and we were basically left with no other option than to purchase another flight on top of the flight we already bought through them. We were never notified that our flight was canceled or anything even could still check in, and see our flight in the frontier app. They are now only offering a refund for the ride back, when we had to pay even more than that to get home because we had to purchase day of plane tickets from a different airline.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Cincinnati to Phoenix,March 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Worst flight experience I have ever had. Frontier used to be a good airline, but now its just a big ""money-grab"". They have fees for everything. First they have lower bag weight limits at 40lbs when most other airlines are 50 lbs. Large fee if you are over the 40 lbs. You have to pay for checked and carry on bags. I have never had to pay for a carry on before. We chose to use the ""Self-Serve"" check in to avoid the fee to go to the ticket counter for help. (It's $25 per person to get help) But, there was only one self serve kiosk and over 100 people in line to use it. Had to pay the fee at the counter or miss our flight. Everything with them is about charging extra fees. At the gate they were charging some people $100 if their carry on didn't fit in the box. The seats were the worst I have ever experienced. They were hard with very little cushion. Clearly the cheapest seats they could find. Employees were not friendly at all. I have flown a lot and this was the worst flight I have ever had. There is nothing good or redeeming with this airline and I will not travel with them again."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Ontario via Las Vegas,October 2022,3.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Bought a round trip ticket with one stop each way. I only had a personal item and packed specifically so that I wouldn't have to pay for an overhead bag. I made it through both legs to my destination without any issues with my personal item. I also made it through the first leg of my trip back, with the same bag and the same items in my bag. However, at the stopover, with only an hour's trip to get home, they suddenly said my bag didn't qualify as a personal item and I would have to pay the overhead baggage fee of $100. My bag has a waterproof coating that does not slide smoothly into their metal measuring boxes, so they claimed it was too big because I had to push it down. I would have been fine with them telling me it was too big on the way there, or even on the first leg of the trip back. At least then I could have given some of my items to my friend and have her ship them to me for much cheaper. But they charge me in the middle of the trip back when the bag passed three previous times?! That means not only am I stuck without a way to unload anything from the bag, but I also couldn't take advantage of the overhead compartment for the whole trip even though I paid the full amount that would entitle me to use it for the whole trip. The single reason people fly Frontier is the lower price. But when they corner you into paying that much for a one hour flight on the last leg of your trip home, you might as well have paid more for a higher quality airline."

The first flight went fine, then we had a layover in Denver before our final flight to Baltimore. When boarding there I was asked to ""size"" my backpack, which of course didn't fit in the tiny cube next to the gate counter. I was informed I would need to pay $99 on the spot even though we had just flown from El Paso and my backpack fit under the seat with no problems on that flight. I shared all of this with the agent who was abrupt and dismissive of me.  There were many other passengers being fleeced just as I was at this same time and the collective frustration was clear. We got on our plane and I needed to access the computer in my bag for my 3 yr old daughter to watch a movie. I opted to keep it with me instead of putting it in the overhead space they had just forced me to pay for... and like magic, it fit once again under the seat. I'm not sure whether to direct my frustration at the agents or the airline. The agents had the power to treat paying customers well or poorly, they chose to treat us poorly. The company probably earned a few thousand dollars more from that one flight because their agents treated passengers poorly regarding their personal baggage. I doubt that the company is too upset about making more money, but I have no way of knowing conclusively whether the situation was prompted by the company or the agents themselves."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Sacramento,March 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will not fly this airline again. I don’t blame this experience on the people I encountered, I blame it on the company. The company website is hard to navigate without them trying to sell you upgrades. I bought the ticket and that’s it. Left Omaha with the carry on bag fitting, great, now leaving Denver, they made everyone do the same thing before boarding. You think the bag police could tell the size of bags that can pass and get people moving quicker, they did it in Omaha. Bag passed just like in Omaha and I paid no more. Flight from Omaha was maybe 40% full to Denver (I see why now), nobody in my row, but I still had to sit in the aisle seat due to “plane balancing issues”. Never again and I would recommend not flying this airline if I were you. If I used their add-ons and had more than my computer bag, the price to fly would be more than most flights. Don’t get caught up in their schemes."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Dallas,March 2023,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,4,"  This Airline bills itself as a ""A la Carte Airline"" but their base level of service is quite lacking. I had an issue getting my boarding pass printed and they were going to charge me $50.00 to print 2 boarding passes. This was on top of an email sent me that encouraged me to check-in early. The check-in seemed to require me to purchase a seat upgrade for me and my wife and a baggage fee for me and my wife, whether we carried the bags on or not. By the time I got checked in I had been charged about $200+ in extra fees. I think that the fees were for round trip. The check-in email notified me that there was a charge in the event I needed help from a ticketing agent. When I had problems producing my electronic boarding pass and was confronted with the $50 charge the ticketing agent was telling me she couldn't help unless I paid the surcharge. I do not understand how an airline can sell a fare, but not provide the services to get through security and onto the plane. The ticketing agents response (to my refusal to pay the fee) is that I was not listening to her. I will avoid Frontier in the future because it will cost a few extra hundred dollars from the planned travel costs."

First, they closed the gate early and didn't have a good reason why. Their were 10 of us left at the gate not able to get in our plane. They made us rebook for 12 hours later. Then on my return trip home they charged me for a bag they allowed me to take as a personal bag on the way there charging me $99 for a bag I had already brought on the plane.

Not only they charge you S100  for a carry on bag, the service is awful and they changed my seat from a window to a seat between to other people because they sold more tickets that they had space for. Seriously some people even had to get another flight because their seat was somehow allocated to someone else. So please do yourself a favor and never ever use this people as they just want take your money and offer a garbage service in exchange. "

That day flight was already fully booked, next one only next morning and the only offer that came from airline via text was refund, rebook and $50 coupon for the next flight.

On my way to Denver, they charged me 2x for bags. So that was an extra 300 dollars and then our flight home was just canceled with no options of getting home or a hotel and just a $50 voucher which is a joke. We then had to book with another airline. I am about $1,000 out right now. There was no help with refunds or any help with money back."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,El Paso to Atlanta,March 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Never again! And that $50 voucher email I received is laughable. I left El Paso at 1230 MTN and arrived in Atlanta at 0445 EST. 10 hours waiting at the Denver airport for my connecting flight because of a 5 hour delay is beyond ridiculous. And to add insult to injury I waited another hour for my luggage. The money you “save” isn’t worth the hassle. Oh and rumor has it the folks at the gate are so strict about carry ons and personal bags because they’re making money for each person they can charge. And I don’t blame em after looking up what the CEO makes vs. airport employees. Frontier is a complete dumpster fire.

I already had issues with Frontier airlines from decades of horrible service but when my ticket was purchased my a family member I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. But I should have. I show up at the airport three hrs early and come to find out a conveyer belt for baggage is down which puts all of our flights in jeopardy since we have to wait over 2 hrs in line to check our baggage. My flight is at 9 and 830 I'm denied the right to check my bag and run to my flight and forced to stand in another line to rebook. Knowing very well where this is going I book a flight with another airline and continue to wait in line for a refund. Well, guess what? Not only will they not refund my money they want to charge me $100 to fly out the next day for their screw-up. I will fight this company and/or these charges until I'm blue in the face. I've never had such poor customer service and I have no idea how this company is still in business. I will never recommend you fly Frontier."

The attendant sat near back bathroom door and when passenger asked if that lavatory was free she said yes, but use the other one. Sat on tarmac waiting for another plane to leave our gate, then another delay before we could exit plane. Girl crying at baggage claim because they lost her bag. Big delay waiting for our checked bag. For a customer oriented service, experience pretty well sucked. Only a cup of water was free on flight if requested. Never again. "

When we arrived at airport to check in, they told us that our flight was canceled because the pilot was sick. They did absolutely 100% nothing to help us, or put us on another airline or anything whatsoever. No hotel for the night or anything. They told us good luck and have a nice day. Nothing done whatsoever. Cost me an extra $1,000 now to get to Punta Cana and it took 30 hours to get there (when our original flight with Frontier was a non stop 5 hour flight). To make matters worse Frontier has no number to call to speak to anyone and even more worse, is that without any reason or communication to me, they went and canceled my flight home as well. In all it cost me another $350 to get home, a day and a half of lost money and vacation time at our chosen resort. A total loss of an additional $1,500 out of my pocket. In all, the absolute worst airline ever and I fly a lot."

I was sent a confirmation number GCBD2G. It was put on my app as an upcoming trip. Everything looked normal as past trips. On my way to the airport March 15 I tried to pull up my boarding pass and it said my flight was non existing. I went to the counter and the Frontier representative researched to see why I wasn’t in the system, but yet I had a confirmation number. She told me my payment was received and then Frontier cancelled it. I had to purchase a full price ticket of $596 one way. I couldn’t call Frontier because they have no phone numbers. I could only use the online chat person who sent me a link for a refund. And you only have 24 hours to request that refund. So I completed the online form while walking thru the airport. I got an email response with their apologies, but there would be no refund difference—very rare not-like responses. I requested a supervisor, but ignored, only more repetitive responses. I will continue until I get a refund. I will not fly Frontier again because I cannot trust that I actually have a ticket, even though they sent me a confirmation code and placed it on my Frontier app as an Upcoming trip. I hope you aren’t a family of 5 and you think you have tickets and you go to check in to find their computer system cancelled your tickets and you now have to pay full price."

The app was still showing the flight was on time, and the screen at the airport didn't say canceled. It took 20 minutes before we got notified. You are pretty much left to fend for yourself.

She wouldn’t agree for it and even we tried requesting her again as we’re already paying for my bag. Then she wont listen anything we speak just do you want to pay for 2 bags or I will close the gates. We have no choice but to pay as the gates will close soon. Then the same lady at the flight entrance looks at us and says ‘oh my god’ is that how you treat your customers. Never in my life I will fly with frontier again and I will suggest my friends and family not to do so. Never seen a flight charging for purse/wallet."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Nashville,March 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines has taken the cake for the cg. The weight of my bag was inspected closer than most prisons do to their new inmates. After determining my checked bag was an acceptable weight, I was confronted about the size of my backpack. They considered my backpack too large to be a personal item, and were trying to make me pay $40 to have it as a carry on. I put on both jackets and the hat that was packed in there. Finally. My bag was smaller than a 2 liter soda. By the time I had gotten on the plane, (which was an hour late due to the fact they didn’t know what plane to put at what gate) I had completely run out of device battery. No problem right? Wrong. There was no outlets on this plane. During all of this I was informed all about the safety procedures. After this horrible flight, I had to try to find my luggage. The claim our luggage was at was occupied by a different flight, Spirit. I waited for 40 minutes for all the Spirit bags to be taken, and unloaded my soaked bag."

I was harassed and called a liar by the airline agent since she thought my bag didn't fit in their box. I initially checked on my own. Then the worker who checks made me check again and saw it fit. Then the agent right after tells me to check the bag again because she saw that it didn't fit which was a terrible lie as it was just verified. I told her her coworker just made me put it in and saw it fit. Her response is I don't care I'm the agent. Total power trip for a low paying job might I say. I then showed her again it fits and she said nothing. Not a sorry for calling me a liar and persisted to talk to us with an attitude. I guess she was mad she lied and all the passengers saw it since she was yelling at me during the encounter. The money saved is not worth the harassment and embarrassment.

No responsible answer. I was told that I would get a call after 5 pm but no calls until 8 pm. Started chatting and finally someone appeared after 2:30 hrs. According to her, I should wait another 4-6 hrs to know about the status of my luggage. I understand about this kinds of issues in the flight. But a customer has rights to receive good customer service which you can never ever expect at least with Frontier airlines. Please do not trust this airlines. They don't have customer service number. You need to depend on the chat and you will find a live representative at least in an hour and more. If you need immediate assistance, what would you do? Pay little more with any other reliable airlines and be free from hassles. This is my first and last flight with Frontier. I would suggest at least to my friends and families not to travel with this airline. You not only pay your money, but your time and tension as well. And one more thing, they cancel/reschedule your flight anytime. However, I should thank the flight crew members and their services."

When booking a flight with Frontier Airlines don’t assume that what you booked is what you will get every time we fly with them. The flight gets changed several times on March 18. We are flying from Cleveland Ohio to Florida, and both legs of our flights have been changed by almost a whole day, for some reason, Frontier believes that when you book a flight with them, they have the option of changing your flight itinerary whenever they want! Heaven forbid you schedule your airline travel around your vacation schedule."

They have been kind of helping me out and reached out to let me know that my bag will be delivered before 8pm today. But after reaching out to them again, it appears it got lost again. I lost a day of my vacation, still don't know if my bag has been found, let alone if it will be delivered today. I get it that bags get lost, but this is the first time in awhile I've flown Frontier. I do believe I will never fly this airline again and would advise to not get tricked by their ""low"" prices for flights."

The hidden fees for tax, security fees, facility charges, etc, plus the cost to have a carry on bag were $102.00, the ""ticket"" price was $140. What a rip off! Also, there is no way to talk with an agent. You have to use a chat bot, or chat with a live agent. It takes forever to accomplish anything over a chat. Very irritated with the entire experience."

I always tell myself that I'll never fly with Frontier again but sometimes their ticket prices just seem cheaper than other airlines. I've taken a total of 15 Frontier flights in the last two years and this is the first time they wouldn't let me fly because of my personal item. They charged me an extra $100  for something they only charge $50 for at check out. I tried explaining that I've been a customer of Frontier for this long and they've never been as flat out rude as they have at Midway to Philadelphia this time. Aside from the discomfort and lack of leg room in the plane which I've had to put up with before, I've never experienced such genuine rudeness and terrible behavior from airline service before. Frontier lost a returning customer for good today and they should look into their flight policy as well as their hiring processes if they ever want to be recommended as an economical option. As is, however, this was the most atrocious airline experience of my life."

Despite having tickets, the website was asking me to buy seats. I knew I had to pay for luggage (a 47 pound suitcase means $50 for the extra 7 pounds). I was certain I'd done everything but the kiosk would not print a luggage tag. I asked a Frontier representative who was helping at the kiosk. She told me to go up and talk to an agent. I followed her directions to the Agent Assistance Required sign. Immediately a Frontier employee pointed at me and told me to get back in the other line. I said ""I'm having trouble checking in and she just told..."" and he laughed, waggled his finger at me, and told me to get back in line. Apparently, ""agent assistance required"" means ""wheelchairs and military only"". Furious, I went back to the kiosk. Still could not get a luggage tag. I finally paid $31 (times 2) for some of the few remaining seats on my phone. Boom, text message from Frontier with a boarding pass, and the kiosk let me print a luggage tag. Fortunately I got to talk to the same agent again, who again laughed that I couldn't figure out how to check in. Several other passengers and I waited for our 10:56 PM flight at a nearby gate. At 10:25, about the time I expected boarding to start, there's a sudden announcement ""Last call for flight 756, if you are not making your way here we will close the doors and they will not reopen."" Well this was quite a surprise to all of us sitting there in the late night quiet airport, as it was the only announcement that had been made. As far as I can tell, the flight left BEFORE its stated time. Never seen such a thing. Flight itself was smooth and uneventful...and landed 20 minutes earlier than expected. I still burn with anger, shaking, about the way the guy at the desk literally laughed and pointed at me, without listening to a word I said. I rage at buying $45 tickets and still having to buy SEATS before it would let me ""check in"". I rage at the way the website fills the check in page with ads to bundle with cars and hotels and upgrade this and that. Never ever again."

As long as you come in with the expectation that this is a budget airline, it's unlikely that you will be disappointed. We flew with one checked bag, no carry on, and two small personal bags and it was great. Checking your bags saves a ton of money, and you don't really lose much time on the back end when you arrive, so its worth it compared to their somewhat pricy carry-ons.

They are always delayed. And if they are not they board the travelers then start figuring out what they should’ve figured out before the flight (now they didn’t log info of previous flights and now they are trying to log them), that’s so stupid and even unsafe. Been sat in the airplane for close to an hour now. Stay away! It’s always an issue! Someone can understand once or twice but I used them every week for the past couple of months and it’s always delayed with issues, took me a while to learn the lesson but will never use them again.

No need to imagine for us. On February 16, 2023, at Stewart International Airport, under clear skies, that's what happened. No delay, no alternate options, just cancelled. The ticket agents were rightfully surrounded by angry travelers, many with young children. They offered no information, not even on if the fare would be refunded. They kept repeating, ""read your email"". We tried to stay calm, knowing that the cruise we booked would no doubt leave without us if we didn't get to Ft. Lauderdale in the next day. We checked our phones for other flights out of the NY/NJ area; only single seats with fares over $1000 for one way. We saw only one option: we got our car out of long term parking ($12 for the hour) and drove (straight) to Florida. Twenty-eight hours later we were able to get on board of the ship. I can only imagine that I'd be trying to sue Frontier Airlines for the cruise cost, the rental car and the hotel in addition to the airfare, instead of calmly writing this review right now. Incidentally, there was no email at the time, however, we saw one later that was sent one hour before we were to be at the airport saying the flight was cancelled (no reason given) and that we should be glad to know we had a $50 voucher for future Frontier flights (never going to be used). Again, no mention of a refund. Stay clear of Frontier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Trenton,March 2023,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Frontier lies about it's personal size. The website says 18x14x8.

I almost lost my flight because with the suitcase that I traveled from Orlando to Puerto Rico it was with the same one with which I was returning from Puerto Rico to Orlando and he wanted to charge me $100 because the suitcase charged him left the wheel by the measurement that it had, but that was the correct measurement that was 18'' and it really is the last time that I will travel with this airline! I even had to break the suitcase, not at all because I had to leave it in Puerto Rico because otherwise I would miss the flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York,February 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I cannot give a low enough review to this company. They made us stand in line for almost an hour to check our bags, then we were told our flight was overbooked and we could not board. It felt like falling victim to an elaborate scam. The price for the flight was not even cheaper than delta, and the flight was delayed twice anyway. Ironically, I was sent an email about the flight delay, but the service desk employee said he had no knowledge of a delay. Also, when I contacted “customer service” about the incident, they said they had no record of the flight being overbooked. Incredible how nothing is consistent in their operations. They just walk away with your money without letting you board their plane, even though you were at the airport an hour and a half before departure."

Our gate got changed from Gate 10 to gate 9 without any announcements made. We haven’t heard them call or notify us. They didn’t even call our name. When we checked our bags, they didn’t even notify us with the changes made. There was no notifications in the app either or no email received."

Instead of the company moving us to another gate we sat there until the other plane moved. This was very inconvenient for everyone. Another thing you have to pay for every bag that you bring, including snacks/water while being on the plane. Your better off paying more for another airline and being comfortable then waiting last minute to be told you have to pay for xyz."

I get the policies, and the need for take off times to be completed however, I flew with a backpack which everyone in front of me was able to fly with yet I get pulled out of line to pay the fee. I took my laptop out and rearranged until the bag fit and they said no it didn’t fit when you had the laptop so we can’t have you go. I understand if I came on with a huge carry on and didn’t pay, we are talking a backpack people that I kept by my feet. I tried to purchase the bag online for a $30 less fee but was yelled at and berated by the airport attendants. "

This caused a lot of issues. Although there credited us for another flight home, our only option was to pick from one that was two days later. This caused me to have to return and rental car, and get a taxi back to our home that was an hour from the airport. Also we had to stay an extra two days. Frontier Airlines is always inconsistent. As good as the price might be, they charge you for everything. Now the carry on bags are getting smaller and smaller. This airline has done stuff like this to us in the past. I am done using this airline. You never know what your going to get. I can't risk the last minute cancellations. I get it if the weather is bad, etc. I gave them a chance, and they could of had our continuing business, we fly once a month with our staff. Not so much anymore."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham,March 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Absolutely the worst experience I ever I had flying anywhere. I book them because of last minute flight to see my mom in the hospital. I wasn't going for long so I figure cheapest price is fine even though they charge a lot for carry on. I figured I don't need carry one so I book it with them since their price is the cheapest by far. Book the flight at 11:40pm, got there on time, check in on time, the e check-in gave me gate D16 even to the almost last minute. At 11:40 still no one line up and I got a little concerned, I check the gate TV screen and it didn't show the flight. I went to check at the bulletin board and the flight gate has changed and left already. Ok, maybe it was my fault didn't hear the gate change, maybe they announce in the wrong section. I am leaning toward announcing in the wrong section because I didn't hear they call my name, Their system never update the flight gate on my phone. I didn't hear anything about my destination. No text, no phone called when I already check in and they have my number. So I asked what now, they told me to go to gate D17 to rebook the flight. The lady that was there said, she was leaving at 12 and I look at my watch, it is 5 minutes after 12, so she left without helping me and told me to go back to ticket check in. After bouncing from one person to the next asking for direction, a whole tour of the airport . They gave me bad direction for something as simple as return back to ticket check in. I rebook another longer flight paid for it but their own employee didn't print my boarding pass and check me in. I didn't realize how big a problem that is until I tried to board the plane. The lady at the gate told me to wait since I didn't have boarding pass, after she let everyone else one she said go to gate D17 rebook the flight. Funny thing is no one was there to help, I had to go back to ticket check in again. I ask to talk to one of their manager after explaining to one of the concierge what happened. The concierge said that the reason that they didn't let me on the flight is because they overbook it, great news! Their manager explain that the person that swipe my credit card should have printed me a boarding pass. Despite admitting that it was their own fault, they won't refund and only offer another flight which I would have to wait a whole day or book another flight and paid them again. In order to use what I have paid, I would have to stay in the airport for more than 30 hours, with total flight and wait time in the airport almost 48 hours and return just in a matter of 3 or 4 hours."

Lines wrapped well beyond and down long hall of MCO of restaurants before security check point. Started security wait line at 5am for a flight leaving at 6:38 am . Was pushed around different lines of security and still had yet to put my bags through the conveyer belt for inspection as my gate time closed at 6:08. Made it to my gate 6:10 door closed plane still attached to the jet way an NO customer service at the front desk. The plane was delayed to leave at 7:10 for aircraft maintenance. I watched from the window as my plane sit there. Unable to use the support system or get a hold of any representative through their new automated chat system. I had to buy a new flight with another airline to fly home. One way ticket costing 330 dollars. I flew American home and was able to buy a ticket at their service counter. We boarded and were up in the air in less than 15 minutes after final boarding. Frontier is garbage, they are rude, Nickle and dime for everything seats and bags that are even semi larger than a kids backpack. Their hands off customer support is frustrating and stressful."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to San Francisco,March 2023,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I've flown Frontier Airlines in the past and had a good experience. Lately they're no longer worth it, too many fees and staff with a bad attitude. You will pay a lower initial fee for the ticket. These are always cheaper than other airlines. Don't be fooled. You will pay the same if not more than other airlines. Here are details: *$19 to $35 per seat, or you will be ""randomly placed"". Forget about keeping your family together. A free personal item, but $50 for a carry-on sized suitcase. $50 for checked luggage up to 40lbs. $50 more if your bag is from 40-50lbs. Total, $100. Everything food & drink related during the flight is charged. You check-in online or he charged $25 for assistance at the counter, or $10 online. The only thing the workers will do is take your bag after putting on the handle sticker. You find out the weight of your bag at that time. If you are 0.1lbs over, you will be asked to pay $50 more bucks and $25 for the assistance. Make sure you travel with a travel scale so you can weigh your bags beforehand. When you're at the gate, there is a thing that your personal item must fit into. If there is any perception it doesn't fit, they will consider it carry-on luggage and charge you $50. Any resistance to paying the fee, they will threaten to kick you off the flight with no refund. Their online system for purchasing a seat location, baggage, looking up your tickets, needs improvement. After you check in, you must screenshot or somehow email yourself the tickets. Otherwise, after that, you will not be able to look up the tickets again. You will have to ask an associate to print them out for you, which they'll grumble about. Seriously...I've never had this level of runaround and ridiculous issues with any other airline."

Tried to make me pay my my purse which is no where near the size of a bag or back pack. They order people in line to move for no reason at all. Same experience on my 2nd leg of the flight to Seattle. 5 hour flights with no food should be illegal. No Wi-Fi, no service of any kind"

Even worse is they thought it was a good idea to go all automated so you can't speak to a person when you need assistance. Should have known this is one of the worst airlines to fly. The CEO should be ashamed to be in charge of such a terrible company.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Las Vegas,February 2023,2.0,5.0,,,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  I flew Frontier because it was the least expensive for the departure time I needed. I booked from the website, did not choose seats, bags, attendant, etc. and therefore did not expect extras. The attendants were pleasant as was the boarding agent. If you don't give grief you usually don't get grief. We were lucky enough that a couple sitting between my daughter and me offered to move over to let us sit together but we did not 'expect' it and would not have asked. The flight was on time, arrived slightly early and uneventful. The seats were some of the least comfortable I have experienced, but again, I booked for the price and wasn't expecting a 1st class seating or service as it seems many do. I have no complaints and will not hesitate to fly Frontier again. Using the app was straightforward since I know how to 'click no' to the screens asking to select seats, add baggage, wifi, priority boarding, etc. My boarding pass appeared with no problem, I was notified that online checking was opening 24 hrs prior to departure and it was flawless and took all of 2 minutes so when we arrived at the airport we went straight to security and then the gate. I certainly feel I got what I paid for and expected along with the added perk of kind and courteous seatmates."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Salt Lake City via Denver,February 2023,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Definitely do not recommend flying with frontier. Very disappointed in this experience. I booked through the Hopper app and chose frontier, as they were the cheapest tickets available. I expected that with being the cheapest option, you get what you pay for, so I was prepared for poor service. When booking with other airlines on the same app, you select your seats and baggage at the time of purchasing your tickets. This was not the case with Frontier. They wait until you are checking in for your flight to select your seats and your baggage/carryons. They also make you check in for each flight individually, and pay for your bags for each leg of your flight. I paid about $350 for my tickets round trip and thought that was a great deal, but ended up having to pay almost an extra $100 per flight (4 flights) in carry on purchases and hidden fees! I chose not to check a bag and only took a backpack, and it was $65 by itself, plus another $30 in ""processing fees."" The overall service was fine, but you do have to purchase everything from drinks on the flight, to services from desk agents. It ended up costing me more than it would have had I purchased tickets through American Airlines or United. Tray tables were dirty, but the cleanliness overall was okay. If you're not going to take any carryons on checked luggage, then by all means go with frontier. Otherwise, save your money and book with a different airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Denver,March 2023,1.0,4.0,,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Horrible airline. They nickle and dime you for everything. And they recently started checking personal item sizes and forcing passengers to pay over $90 just to board the flight with their slightly oversized personal items that completely fit under the seat in front of them. This combined with no personal space during your flight makes these flights not worth the money. My advice, spend a little extra money for a real and decent airline."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Denver,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is a constant source of unnecessary anger and stress. There is no customer service reps to talk to, it's all AI. The phone number doesn't work, no email correspondence. It's like no one actually works at Frontier. The rates aren't even the cheapest as they claim to be. Often times they are just as high or higher than Southwest, Delta, and American Airlines. So what am I saving by buying a Frontier ticket? Nothing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Cancun to Orlando via Charlotte,March 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier is the absolute worst! I paid to check my instrument as a ""bike"" because it was larger than a checked bag and was the only option that I saw other than a regular sized checked bag when I purchased my ticket online. This worked perfect for 2 out of 4 of my flights that i had the instrument with me  (I had 6 flights with frontier altogether in 10 days) On my 3rd flight: After being told to go to a wrong line 3 different times (and spending 30-45 min in each line), they told me that my instrument (that I already paid extra for) was going to be considered ""oversize"" and there was going to be an additional $89 oversized bag fee (because a bike isnt already oversized?). My instrument is smaller than a bike. There is absolutely no need to charge an additional oversize fee Now I have paid for 1 checked bag, 1 bike, and an additional oversized bag fee (for the bike/instrument). For reference, the case that holds the instrument below is 60"" long. A bike (on average) is 69"" long. So, I get in touch with customer service on chat - since they no longer take phone calls (I wonder why) and the agent was sarcastically rude and leading me on once I ask them to escalate the chat to a supervisor and instead of transferring me, they leave me on ""hold"" or on a blank screen pretending like a supervisor will come at some point but never actually gets one. Ultimately the agent brushed my claim off by stating that what I was telling them was hearsay and that they ""wish they could have been there to see it but since there is no way to back up my claim, there was nothing they could do"".

We were delayed on the incoming flight by 2hours, and return flight by another 2 hours. The attendant was extremely rude when I asked about our flight. It was erased from the electronic signage at the gate because it was so late, so I was worried I missed it, although I was waiting at the gate for over 4hours! This airline is terrible! JetBlue has always been consistent. Never again for this lousy airline that could care less about your time or schedules!"

Went on a business trip and was told that if I go to the counter, I will be charged $25 for an attendant. Once I was checked in online, I checked a bag. That was a $60 charge. Didn’t have to measure my book bag at any airport except Denver. It fit in the personal bag compartment but because the fabric was showing a 1/2” above, mind you it was just fabric, I had to pay $99 to carry it on. This airline is a joke. I will stick with American or Delta. I have already warned my entire family that it’s not worth the cheap prices."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Cleveland,February 2023,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,1,  The company is extremely frustrating to deal with. The website continually locks up if you try to purchase without adding luggage and when you refresh the prices increase. If you have any issues it is impossible to get ahold of anyone. If they change a non stop to a lay over and you want to change to a different flight you can not speak with anyone and the chat is a dead end that never allows you to get answers. Anytime you need to update a flight you just have to take the loss on that ticket and purchase a different one. Never get round trip tickets so when you waste a flight it will only cost you half the amount. They have the only non stop flights from TPA to CLE so i am stuck flying them. They have the cheapest tickets but by far the least value for the money.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha  to Las Vegas,February 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,2,"  I have flown with Frontier many times. I tried checking in at the kiosk center which is what I always do no matter who I fly with. When that didn't work I went to the ticket counter and the ticket agent said it was $25 per person for my husband and I so that's $50 because I didn't check in online through my email, and I only had 24hrs to check in? I didn't know? Our plane was scheduled for take off at 9:30pm. We didn't board until 3 hrs later. Then was charged for basic drinks and a snacks on the plane which is also normally complementary. Then, flying back home. Our plane was scheduled to fly out at 3.30pm. We weren't notified about a delay until it was time to board which was 2.45pm. I do understand that the weather can be the cause for delays and that's no ones fault. But when you have to spend extra money on food, and drinks, when customers are already being inconvenienced. Then my husband and I were not charged for a carry on bag going to our destination, but coming back he was charged $99 for the same bag he came with?? It caused quit an uproar. There was no explanation for the charge? It was just pure attitude and rudeness. Then the frontier employee stated that she could charge him an extra 100 if she wanted too?? The ticket prices where amazing but I feel bamboozled, because Frontier charges for everything else, that usually is included. Basically what I feel is lacking is communication of what the airline policies are. Better customer service, compensation on basic snacks and drinks"

The employees are extremely rude, planes are dirty. Then they actually charged me $298 00 for luggage that was not mine and refused to reimburse me after I had paid prior for my luggage. They used my information to charge for other people's luggage. I tried to contact them. They only have a chat system which told me basically to bad. I will never fly with them again. I am disputing all charges with my bank."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,March 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,3,"  Worst experience ever. The first flight to Florida was honestly very smooth and not all bad. Seats are not comfortable (expected) and leg space was just enough. Online check in was not horrible except for the million times i had to say not to adding luggage and no to choosing a seat. The price for choosing a seat and adding just a carry on is so ridiculous that you may as well go with another flight with better seats. Now for the reason I will never fly with them again. Out flight was delayed for 7 hours. We had an email saying it was due to the airline helping with another late flight, a hostess saying the plane needed maintenance, and finally the pilot saying there was not an available plane. The fact that there was 3 reasons means all it was was a bunch of excuses. We had our whole day stolen from us as we were stuck in an airport and all they could do is give $50 towards another flight and a $20 food voucher. Only props was when they checked the bags to make sure it was the right size was that they let you force it in. If you want a carry on and and easy to deal with flight, go somewhere other than Frontier."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Denver,February 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will never fly with Frontier again. Flew to DC for a weekend trip with just a personal item. Before boarding the plane on the flight home they forced us to measure our bags to ensure they qualified as personal items, but the individuals at the counter said bags “didn’t fit” if you had to use any force at all to get them to slide into the measuring tool. Bags literally had to slide down by the force of gravity alone or you have to spend $100 to “upgrade” your ticket to a carry-on. I get that Frontier is a budget airline. I can happily put up with the uncomfortable seats and terrible service knowing I’m saving money. Being pulled out of line to perform an absurdly strict bag measuring exercise and then being forced to pay for a last minute, unnecessary $100 upgrade is ridiculous treatment of customers. If I had known my ticket would cost an extra $100, I never would never have settled for frontier in the first place. It seems like a company that has to force its customers to pay for more expensive services by increasingly drastic measures to stay afloat probably shouldn’t exist in the first place. If you’re thinking about flying with frontier, reconsider. I won’t ever be traveling with the airline again."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Cancun,February 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Spend a little more and fly another airline. The seats are rock hard. No snacks, no tv, you pay a ton for assigned seats and baggage fees. I can handle all of those things for a short flight but checking in made this a no go for me. Instead of checking in online and printing your bag tags to just drop off, you have to stand in ridiculously long lines for them to do it for you. Makes zero sense when they have machines at the Atlanta airport. Every person I spoke with said that this was their first and last flight with frontier. I agree."

This Airline has all but peppered the experience in a negative way! First we booked on Priceline, as it showed the price was with one personal carry on, and one checked bag. The airline stated “ Oh! Priceline always makes mistakes! Okay that “Mistake” cost my wife and I around 500.00 for bags. Next I paid an extra 60 or 65 per seat for the exit row! I got 2 non reclining prop up seats with the padding of a cheap ironing board. So we flew non stop it seemed like a eternity to get to Orlando.  We get there only too find “No One” can locate out fire arm case? After waiting an extra hour, we filled out there form as apparently fire on bags seem to come up missing there? as there was another one with the same problem.  We were promised the bag would be delivered to our hotel. Well apparently we were lied too according to the  young lady that finally called us back as I booked our room an extra day as the airline wasn’t communicating with us after leaving them a message! She called as I’m sure because I mentioned will they be reimbursing me for the extra night? Well she stated not her dept! And they wouldn’t be delivering the bag to our hotel and I’d have to pay Uber to come and get it. And again I asked who'll will be paying me for my expense for there dereliction?

Also you must be aware when checking in or purchasing your ticket online as they have boxes preselected for you and if your not paying attention, you will be significantly up charged for your bags.

If you want to reserve a seat they have a chart of the plane and the prices go up the closer you get to the door which is average of around 50 to 60 to $70, we flew to Cancun and how are you supposed to have enough clothes and supplies for 9 days with 40 lb luggage, you can't. We ended up spending an extra $500 to fly with them because of overweight check bags and assigned seating."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Denver,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Absolutely horrid airline. Disrespected by employees and so poorly taken care of upon cancellation of flight due to mechanical issues that its comical. They don't hold to their word what so ever. They informed me I would get reimbursed for the hotel I had to purchase due to THEIR cancellation and when the time came to reimburse, they refused. Disgusting. My credit card bills are high and I'm struggling to pay these down now. I was under the impression I would be compensated, as I did not have any friends in the departure city and was self reliant on finding a place to sleep and a completely new flight, since Frontier didn't have anything available for TWO DAYS after the original flight. And they are holding me responsible. I mean what in the world kind of policy is that. I needed to get to work the next day. Would they pay for the two days of missed work? I highly doubt it. It's like punching someone in the face and then when asking for a bag of ice you just get punched again. So rude. I will never fly with this airline again and I HIGHLY encourage others to never fly with Frontier. It is NOT WORTH IT. Just spend the extra money on a better airline. You won't have to pay extra for every additional thing on the fight and you'll actually get compensated and reimbursed for the airline's failure to do their job. I'm out $500 due to this situation. Ridiculous. Do better Frontier."

I told them I was having trouble loading my TSA pre check # on the app and my boarding pass and she continued to tell me I was fine and would not print me my pass after asking twice. The airport had some issues w/ lines but that’s not about Frontier. I went to the line for TSA after a 60 min delay due to the airport but they would not take my pass on my phone. I had to go back to the check in. The woman was very unkind and proceeded to tell me it was a TSA issue not a Frontier issue. I have traveled for work for years and this has never happened. She proceeded to tell me that she won’t argue with me, shrugged her shoulders and that it just must not be my lucky day. I barely made it on my flight. Unacceptable horrific customer service. I will be writing a review on every platform. This was infuriating. 0/10 if possible."

The Frontier website suggested I book the next available flight which would’ve sent me to Raleigh, North Carolina and I wouldn’t be home until 24 hours later (11:30 AM the next day). I booked this flight via my phone thinking I’d be home the same day as I didn’t see the discrepancy of leaving the same day but arriving the next. None of the details about the flight and its overnight connection were made clear during the process of rebooking through their website. Once the transaction occurred the details were emailed to me and I then saw that the flight would not get me home until the following day. I’d miss work and my kids would be left home alone on Presidents Day as they had a day off from school. All of this happened while I was in an Uber traveling to the airport. I visited a the rebooking desk at the Las Vegas airport to ask for a refund of the new charges as I had accidentally booked a flight that I didn’t understand and couldn’t see the details for. I was told that this was all my fault (as in they literally said it was my fault to my face), there was nothing they could or would do, I’d have to cancel it myself, and to leave the desk. They actually shooed me away yelling for the next person. The representative wouldn’t even look me in the eye. She adamantly refused to even try to help me. They wouldn’t even cancel the flight. I had to do it myself and still be charged for it. I’ve never been treated so rudely by an airline in 30 years of flying. I was shocked. I sat down and canceled the flight myself and was able to rebook with another airline.  Do not fly on Frontier Airlines."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Las Vegas,February 2023,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I am incredibly disappointed and infuriated by Frontier Airlines. We ended up having to cancel our entire trip (that had been booked for months) the night before due to Frontier Airlines canceling our flight and leaving us stranded at the very last minute. I received absolutely zero communication from Frontier that my flight had been cancelled. The only way I found out my flight was cancelled is because when trying to check-in the night before I kept getting an error message. I reached out to customer service who told me my flight was cancelled earlier that day. After cancelling the flight, Frontier offered little to no solution. I was told I would not be able to reach my destination until 2 days later. Never again. I will never ever book with Frontier again. Next time, I will absolutely pay more money for a more reliable airline so I know I will reach my destination without having to worry that my flight will be cancelled and I will be left stranded. I understand last minute cancellations can happen due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, mechanical, etc) but this situation was not one of those reasons. I wish I would’ve done a little research on Frontier prior to booking. I have read so many other recent stories similar to mine. Frontier’s treatment of their customers is completely unfair and irresponsible. Aside from this, when I booked I didn’t know Frontier is a budget airline. Frontier is a budget airline and it shows. They will nickel and dime you for everything. The prices of checked bags and carry-ons is outrageous. The price to select a seat is significantly more than I’ve ever paid with any other airline before. They also charge extra if you check-in at the airport with a live agent instead of using the kiosk. Ridiculous."

When I tried to switch they wanted me to pay like 145 dollars to switch a flight I already paid for to a flight that was only 100 if I just paid cash - so either way it was gonna cost me the cost of another flight.

There was no help from Frontier Airlines; they were very rude. They said we can fly on February 17 for free, because this is the next flight for them. The Frontier Airlines customer service does not exist at all, they just recommend online chat that is a robot, the worst experience ever. As a result, we were forced to book a flight with another company without assistance. The tickets were a lot more expensive and it went out of my pocket because we could not postpone the trip.

For customer service you can chat only. Waited an hour for representative and when she connected I've asked why you selling tickets when you can't keep with your schedule. She disconnected. But the interesting part is that same thing happened to my daughter a month ago with Frontier. So I'm assuming they selling cheap tickets few months upfront but when ticket prices going up and on demand they just can't keep up with ""the schedule"". Never recommend this airline to anybody.

Don’t think that this is marketed for most people. This is STRICTLY for people that are ok with picking a flight to go somewhere on 24 hours notice and you CAN’T book your return flight so you will NEVER know how long you will be there as you CAN’T book your return flight until 24 hours before you hope to leave. So you will never know how long you will be at your destination. It is worth paying the extra to use any other airline so you can actually plan for your stay and not be worried about the hotel being sold out and being left living like a homeless person while you wait for a flight from Frontier.

I have the Samsonite bags  Costco receipt for the both the bags and they told me the items they sold me were based on the Frontier Standards. Also once on the flight they don't even give you water for free, they charge for everything and also when a person is fast asleep they wake them up and ask if they wanna make a purchase and on saying no they still push you to buy things they don't need --- the height is when they also woke me and my mother up again to ask if we have any garbage to throw, isn't this ridiculous of them to ask. the staff was rude as well."

I paid almost $100 for a front row seat only for the flight attendant to take my bag and move it down 3 rows because they needed more overhead bin space. Now I will be even more delayed in deplaning. The whole reason for the front row seat was so I could get off the plane in a timely manner and not right thru a crowd rushing off a plane to get my bag! In addition to that I was stopped prior to boarding to size my small backpack which fit perfectly yet people in front and behind me were not stopped and asked to do this task! Meanwhile my sandwich I purchased in the airport is completely smashed now due to me shoving my bag in a sizer that clearly fit! I strongly suggest not flying with this airline the staff is poorly trained. I fly Spirit all the time and never have any of the issues. No wonder Spirit chose to merge with Jetblue in the end and back out of the deal with Frontier!

Then, I flew from Orlando back to Houston and was charged me $100 for the same thing I had when I came and they did not charge me for the first time. If they charged me the first time I would be ok with it and understand and prepare myself but that did not happen and is why I did not pay for my bag before hand. Also, the first one that charged me the $25 in the front desk did not gave me my receipt. I am not happy with this because everyone should be on the same page not sometimes charged and sometimes wont. The prices are affordable but if they charge you for whatever they feel like that day, depending on their mood, then is not worth it because you end up paying the same as a better airline. I am not happy, it was my first time flying with them."

Once I finally made it through the end of booking, it said no more seats were available at the price they advertised. I used the online chat to book after the hours of difficulty with the website. They charge for this. I was specific about only needing to check 1 bag and no carry-on and have the screenshots. They booked my flight but said I had to go back online to their barely functioning website to add the rental car as well as my known traveler number for TSA Precheck. I then began getting daily notifications that no bag was added to my ticket so I went back on and added my checked bag. Then I was charged for 2 checked bags even though I only had 1 as well as a carry on which I did not have. My flight from philly to Orlando did not have the precheck stamp so I just rolled with it. The desk folks at PHL gave the impression they did not care folks were waiting in line having conversations amongst themselves and one clerk with her back to the customers at her computer station fiddling with her phone. From Orlando to Philly, I attempted 3 times with the desk to get my precheck added but they had no idea how add my TWIC card so I went through standard 40 min. TSA security again. I also brought up the fact that they charged me for bags I did not have and the desk person gave me a card to address the issue. When you follow the link on the card, it says no refunds are given for bags even if you don't check or carry them on. Follow up with customer service provided no resolution. On the flight, there was food left in the seatback from the previous flight. We ran into turbulence and the lady next to me started getting motion sickness. I looked in the seatback for a barf bag and there were NONE! Fortunately she kept down her dinner! 1 out of 10 is too high of a score since they failed on every possible point except I did arrive at my destinations albeit late."

They did not have enough agents working to process baggage check in slow going, and once we reached the front of the line, we were told we were supposed to have printed our own baggage claim tags at the kiosk. If the agent printed our tag out, it cost $25 per bag. Ridiculous! There were agents there, who could’ve told us to do that prior to standing in the long lines. We ran back and printed our tags. Then we were told our luggage was 1 pound overweight and needed to pay another $50. They are nickel and diming their customers to make some extra money.

I decided to wake up earlier just because I was excited to see my family that day on vacation and I had a rental car booked when arriving into Phoenix, I received an email from Frontier on 2;01am stipulating that my flight was cancelled without a reason? Their customer service dept was closed and finally I was able to chat with frontier online. They gave me an option to take a late night flight to Vegas which I would be stuck in Vegas overnight at their airport and lose my car rental reservation, get their next direct flight on 2/5/23 or get my $$ back, I opted to get my $$ back right away as their options were horrific. Now, I no longer can trust frontier to do business ever again. I then booked American Airlines that same morning on 1/31, ended up paying double the cost but that flight left Detroit on time and I ended up getting to see my family almost an hour earlier]. My return flight to Detroit on American was on time and got me home 13 min earlier than expected on 2/9/23. The moral of the story is that (moving forward) I’ll now only fly American or perhaps Delta. However, I most certainly will never fly Frontier ever again as they’re disreputable and can not be relied on to get to a destination. My trust for Frontier is done!"

I have done it once and said, ""never again"". I just booked another flight for the second time, and it was instant regret again at the airport. Why did I book them again? Cheap! They ripped me off with the baggage and charged me 124$ for the roundtrip, only because I carried a small carry-on bag. I did this upfront, not last minute at the airport, otherwise, it would have been over 200$. Upon arrival, I walked to the check-in desk because I had not received any boarding passes. The lady (who was helpful) said that the flight was delayed for 5hrs. I did not know. She checked my information and gave me an email address I had never heard of in my life. That was why I did not receive any communication (funny, I did receive the confirmation from trip.com). She told me to go online and get the boarding passes myself, otherwise, she had to charge me 25$ per person. When I opened the browser on my phone, it only showed me errors, so she friendly helped me print out the boarding passes for free. After waiting for 5 hrs, the gate changed, and everyone had to change the gates. after a total of 5.5hrs, we boarded, and once everyone was in their seat, we were told to move 20 people to the front of the plane. What the heck, the plane wasn't even empty! We left with a total delay of 6 hrs. The return flight we had another misery of 4.5hrs delay, gate change several times, etc. No matter if it's cheaper, at the end you pay and suffer more."

Their approach was to send an email apologizing that our flight was ""disrupted"". We had no idea what that meant so we tried to call, but they have no phone number. They require you to chat with a representative, which we did. The rep, who struggled to communicate in English, confirmed that our fight was still booked and leaving on time. So we headed over to the airport only to find the flight was canceled! All the passengers there were as shocked as we were. Their agents offered us a refund or to rebook...but all the flights were sold out! We would have to rebook the next day from another airport. When I asked the agent why the flight was cancelled she said ""air traffic control"" but could not explain what that meant or why our flight was canceled. It was certainly not due to weather because it is a beautiful day and there are planes flying over us as I write this. I don't understand how they can just cancel a flight and not notify you that the flight is cancelled. Very upset and now have to pay 4x the amount and miss my meeting tomorrow am. Not right."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Juan via Tampa,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The Frontier of old is dead the once great, affordable, and caring airline is now officially worse in class in just a few short years ... it just isn’t worth it. They have completely abandoned the concept of service, let alone customer service. I recently purchased 5 tickets to take my family from Denver to San Juan on Jan 27th. During the first leg of our flight Denver to Tampa Fl our Frontier plane had a mechanical issue, so our flight was diverted to Atlanta Georgia. Here is where the nightmare begins, after being abruptly dumped in Atlanta the gate agent tried to get us to our final destination San Juan but was unable to through any city Frontier flew due to the severe overbooking of Frontier flights. She advised the best Frontier could do is maybe get us to our final destination 3 days into our 5 day vacation if it at all. So this gate agent being a normal human knowing our situation (that one of the passengers a Type 1 Diabetic that required the constant insulin and pump accessories which extra now needed days worth were in her checked bag that Frontier was going to send off to San Juan to sit in the heat for 3 days) had the common sense that this would not work so she advised our family to book with another carrier. Per her advice we did at a cost of over $2500 almost 300% more than our first round trip tickets. This gate agent then provided us a card to get a refund for our travel costs which Frontier was unable to provide. Now a normal person would quickly look at the situation and say Frontier did not provide service from Denver to San Juan at all and Frontier was not able to produce a solution to even get us there reasonably delayed. So, at minimum this customer is owed for services Frontier did NOT provide and the right thing to do would be compensate them the extra travel cost that a Frontier Rep in Atlanta advised them to book. Instead, Frontier flat out refused any refund stating “I review all the information to make sure that I did not missed any information but it shows on our end that more of the flight a on time and there's a segment that delayed more than an hour so for this type of information, I am sorry but we're unable to process your refund request.”  Only delayed more than an HOUR… Frontier couldn’t provide service for at min of 72 HOURS!! That doesn’t make any sense at all you dumped a family of 5 in Atlanta, in turn missing the flight to San Juan. You then only offered the solution of staying a night in Atlanta then going to a different city than planned Miami staying the night there because there was a better chance of maybe going to San Juan 3 days later. What world does that make sense to anyone? I have flown Frontier for years; This is not the service I received in the past at all. A few years back I was once delayed a little over hour at a gate and got a travel voucher offered (I didn’t even ask)"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Portland,February 2023,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  The absolute worst business ever conceived. They nickel and dime you for everything and their cancellation policy is worded to purposefully confuse you. They won't refund or provide a voucher for necessary cancellations unless you pay up front. So they keep your money and then resell the seats. They advertise cheap prices but then charge you for everything but air to breath. They even discontinued a customer service phone number because they couldn't keep up with the complaints. The most uncomfortable seats ever made.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,February 2023,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Please read all of the fine print before dealing with this airline. I booked a flight for my sons and I for a sports trip. We ended up not having enough players for the trip so I had to cancel my flight. Well, there are no refunds or cancellations so I lost the entire $600 plus that I spent. The airline conveniently charged a $99 cancellation fee plus taxes per person with conveniently equaled the exact same amount that I paid for the ticket. On top of that, there is no way to get a live person on the phone, only email or chat. I was able to cancel all of our other arrangements and got my money back. I didn't necessarily have to get all of my money back but if I could have gotten a credit to use towards another trip, I would have been satisfied. But there was no money left over after their fees. So please make sure you have some insurance or better yet, just fly a better quality airline."

Their sizers seem to be smaller than the website says the max dimensions are too so maybe bring a tape measure. Get your cheap flight but don't let them rip you off just because they're scrambling for money after all those forced refunds! I would wait until after your return flight to file the charge back so they can't be petty and strand you.

Someone asked if we may please get water since some of the guests were not able to get something to drink prior to getting on the flight. The flight attendant told the passengers to be patient and to STOP complaining! She stated that she would not be able to provide water because it would prolong us being there and that they too want to get to their destination. Unfortunately that’s  unacceptable being that she’s being paid to work and as customers we paid for a service regardless of the cost of our tickets we should all been treated fairly and properly. There were infants and children on the plane. A gasp was heard throughout the plane with disbelief of what and how she said it. After two other really nice flight attendants did offer water to the passengers. In my opinion it was the way the passengers were treated. They should have allowed those that needed to get off to do so and return. This was a inconvenience to the passengers so they should of been a little more compassionate. Also they broke my sister new luggage and refused to replace it because she didn’t call within 4 hrs.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Chicago,February 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Absolutely ridiculous!! Never flying with Frontier Airlines again! We booked a flight that was supposed to leave at 6:30am, had 4 delays and waited at the airport for an extra 3 hours for them to tell us the flight was cancelled. Luckily we were able to book with a different airline for the same day since we both have to get back to work the following day. Then when we tried to get a refund at the desk where the attendant told us to go, they told us we just had to wait for an email. Very unprofessional!!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to St Louis,February 2023,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Completely incompetent airline, arrived over an hour early for our flight, had to wait in line for 45 mins to get our boarding pass, they let half the line cut in front of us for a different flight causing us to miss our flight. Thenthey told us we would have to rebook, pay another $100 each for rebooking for a flight out of an airport that's a two hour drive away from where we are staying and we have no way of getting there. Received no apology from anyone and was patronized by Frontier staff the entire time. I will never fly Frontier again, absolutely awful experience."

Very rude and condescending. If the passengers were holding slippers or pillows out for the flight, they were made put everything back in the bag and test it again. Very, very unpleasant. I was my first flight with Frontier, and i will not be flying again. Humiliation should not be a part of an economy experience, and if an airline is determined to get their money one way or another, they should not sell basic tickets under false pretence. They had definitely lost my custom."

Gate agent kept pulling people from the line to check their carry on and once we didn’t meet requirement, charged us an additional $100. Staff member told us with a bad attitude “we warned you 3 times. Other airlines significantly cheaper when you calculated the additional fees. Never flying Frontier Airlines again"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Denver,February 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,4.0,2,no,1, Was delayed 2 hours. Made the passengers spend an hour inside the flight.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Orlando,February 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, This flight was disgustingly horrible. We started out boarding at gate D1 then they switch our gate back to E4. Then when we got there they proceeded to switch our gate back to D3. Needless to say everyone on the flight is exhausted and sweaty from running around the Atlanta Airport. Then when I went to inquire about the actual flight departure time the agent at the front desk was rude and nasty with me as if she had to run around the airport herself. I rest assured that me and no one who is boarding this flight would recommend that NO ONE EVER FLY FRONTIER. They charge for everything and are super unprofessional. If you dont take my word for it you will see yourself.

Bag had small wheels that would not fit into the rigid sizer but was actually smaller than what is allowed - 15x13x8. And fit no problem on my flight from Buffalo to Tampa. Needless to say will not fly with them again. Big money grab and unprofessional, not to mention the terrible seats.

The funeral was delayed so I called 2 days prior to my return in order to extend the date of return. First of all you can't talk to anybody in customer service because they don't have one. I was attended by a third party (orbit) and they charged me an extra $133 dollars per traveler in order to change our flight. Next Frontier charged me $118 for my luggage and $40 to get my seats. When I arrived to the airport they couldn't find my tickets and said I took off to Chicago. What, I'm right here! Well they said that they had to charge me again for the luggage because I missed my flight! Well its $158 dollars and you could call customer service for a refund. They charged me $5.00 to talk to an agent, $3.50 for water on the plain. Everything cost money on these flights."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Ana to Dallas Ft Worth,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Traveling with young kids can be hard, and incredibly stressful. Traveling with young kids by yourself is harder, which was my case It sounds like helpful, understanding, compassionate, and owning up to their huge mistakes were unfortunately not the words of the day for a mom who was recently traveling on a Frontier Airlines with my three-year-old daughter from Santa Ana to DFW early January. My child's stroller was completely damaged upon receiving it at our layover in Las Vegas (where Frontier airline attendants told me to tell them at our final destination of the damage). I then had to somehow with no help from the airline and my situation of having no workable stroller to transport my carry on, diaper bag, toddler, damaged stroller to our connecting flight, with our flight being delayed by 5 hours. I was furious! After landing finally at DFW at 2am in the morning, I went to the baggage claim office, and the process to figure that out, what to do about my situation of my trashed stroller, took way too long, and resulted in my finally being told by Cecil who was solely handling the incident at customer service from the baggage department that the manager the following day would call me for an update, and she ordered me to let her take the stroller, and that she would give it to their department that fixes items like baggage, and if Frontier could not fix it, they would reimburse me for the stroller if I could give proof with a receipt of how much it cost. She then got all of my information, my drivers license, phone number, trip confirmation number etc. and this would be given to the manager the following morning. I am guessing you already know the outcome of this, that this did not happen (the manager contacting me), nor did the airline fix or reimburse me for my stroller, hence my having to write this letter. It was actually way worse (after I finally was able to get an update on it ultimately by going all the way back to the airport) that they threw away my stroller, or one of the workers took it. I contacted the claims department online and tried to file a claim there, but they repeatedly told me to take pictures, even though I repeatedly told them that they took my stroller and it was in their possession. I have never faced a customer service department that is more difficult to contact. They have no phone number, just an automated chat that I am questioning even has a real live person option, based on my communication with a supposed ""live"" representative. I had to travel 1+ hours with my toddler all the way to the airport again just to receive a status update (where I found out it was thrown away and that Cecil the customer service representative that took my stroller and assured me it would be fixed or replaced was lying to me. She offered sympathy at that time, that she too had kids. This makes me wonder if she took it, because when I went back to DFW airport and spoke with Nenita, she aggressively said that it was against airline policy to fix damaged strollers. My stroller cost 300$ and I bought it used, but that isnt the entire point. They took my stroller and either threw it away or stole it for themselves. Nenita said that Cecil said I no longer wanted the stroller and that I accepted a 20$ umbrella stroller from walmart in replacement, being content. If this is the case, why was it held for 3 days at the airport having Nenita wonder why I wasn't picking it up."

Flight delays, 7 delays in total. Arrived at 5 pm and its now 10:48. No more Frontier, glad they fixed the plane, but please learn to be honest and tell time. They may have the lower prices, but you pay for your seat, carry on, and check in individually. So its still Cost you."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Hartford via Orlando,February 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Absolute lame excuse for an airline. Extremely unorganized and unreliable. Grossly overbooked my flight as spent an hour trying to convince passengers to fly to a different city altogether. Forced everyone to size their bags and anyone whose bag was too big had to get out of line and pay. Those who tried to pay online couldn’t due to the poor quality of app and website. They charged me more than my flight cost just to bring a single bag onboard. It seemed as if more people boarded than there were total seats, and by the time the plane was supposed to be in the air people were still shuffling around the cabin trying to find seats, often separated from traveling companions. This airline is absolutely horrible and I will never fly with them again. I strongly suggest no one does, as the headaches, zero legroom, and insane overcharging of customers is not worth saving a few bucks. Their lack of organization directly caused delays, possibly affecting layovers. I’ve never had an experience this poor, and after trying Frontier once over a month ago I decided to give them another shot. They failed miserably yet again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Tampa,February 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, UNACCEPTABLE! Frontier Airlines changed our flight from a NONSTOP 3-hour flight to TWO 3-HOUR FLIGHTS with a TEN HOUR layover and a 4:30 AM arrival time. And then did not offer a full refund. Absolutely ridiculous!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando  to Las Vegas,February 2023,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,3," Frontier Airlines' customer service is nonexistent and shows no appreciation for their customers. There is no complimentary tea, coffee or water. It is not possible to print your boarding pass, not from a computer at home or at the kiosk when you get there. When I could not print my boarding pass from home, I assumed I could print it out when I got there from the kiosk but that was not an option. I was told if I wanted it printed out the charge would be $25. I had to put the App on my phone at the airport in order to board. For those reasons and a bigger one - that you cannot call and talk to a live representative - I will avoid flying with them again."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Milwaukee to Las Vegas,January 2023,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Worst Airline Ever. First I paid upfront for a seat upgrade, only for my flight to be canceled, 45 minutes before boarding. Then I asked my flight attendant, she told me they were over booked, and my upgrade was invalid, then asked how to get a refund, she said to call customer service, easy enough, right? Only customer service is all automated, so you can imagine how that went. Then I thought, I would ask for some sort of compensation for having to stay another night in Vegas @$250+ a night. Once again not even worth the time and frustration/disappointment. So in conclusion, I will never fly Frontier again, worst customer service, by far the worst experience I've had flying. One more thing I paid for WiFi and I didn't work, for half the flight that had paid for it."

We had one carry on and one personal item. It is not our fault Frontier let people check the multitude of large, heavy baggage! There were a total of 10 passengers that were told they would have to fly next day! We were called to the boarding desk and they stated they were able to get us on the flight as another passenger volunteered to fly next day. We were given our boarding pass but we were not in our original seats we PAID for. The staff response was they needed our original seats for wheelchair passengers. UM, we PAID extra for those seats they shouldn’t have been available for anyone to purchase! We were then told that they would refund us. The crap show did not stop there. The refund was placed as a credit and the system would not let us check in for our return home as it stated we had a balance due! It was a CREDIT not a balance due. We had to buy a service we already had in order to get rid of the credit so we could check in! You can’t have any type of help as you are charged a fee. Frontier fees their passengers to death! This was a direct flight: No complementary beverages, i.e. soda, water juice; no in-flight internet or entertainment – You PAY for everything!! This will be the last time we fly with Frontier, the direct flight is not worth their horrible service!"

However, leaving Denver Colorado with a shopping bag of things I had purchased, thinking ok. Houston was fine. So I have my personal bag and a shopping bag, small not too big at all. The gate attendant was rude, condescending and no compassion whatsoever. In my world customer service is paramount and this wasn't it. I took flight 760 and all employees servicing this flight was horrible. By the way, I had to pay $99 for a small shopping bag. Unacceptable."

Well because Frontier didn't help us at all and just stranded us here. I had to spend $300 to get a ticket with another carrier and the soonest was 8am in the morning. They have a hotel in this airport but nope they wouldn't get us a room. Many restaurants nope no food either. They are horrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Chicago,January 2023,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2," The most disorganized airline ever. My fiancé and I were scheduled to fly out of Cancun to Chicago on January 4, 2023 on Frontier Airlines flight 45. We checked in ourselves and our luggage and then went to the departure gate about an hour before boarding time and heard other passengers talking about a flight cancellation. We then checked our app and saw that my ticket said canceled but that of my fiancé said nothing. We had received two emails about flight delays, but neither of us got one in reference to the cancellation. Due to this confusion, we began searching the airport for a Frontier Agent but could not find anyone. We then went back down to the check in counter where a Frontier Agent told us to wait at a different counter for instructions on how to rebook as well as find our luggage. After an hour, we were told to once again pass through security and go to our original departure gate. When we got there, a Frontier Agent was present but told us that she had no information and that we should go back to the original check in counter. We ran back down, were told to go back up and so once again passed through security and returned to the same gate. At that point, we were told to go to yet another gate on another level where we waited an hour only to be told to go back to the original gate. At that point, we were notified that we could not be placed on a flight until January 9th so it was up to us to figure it out. We were then escorted to our suitcases which required us to go through both passport control and security. As we were not offered a reasonable alternative from Frontier (we did not have an extra 5 days to spare), we booked a ticket on Southwest for $932.08. We had to once again go through the whole check in process and security. Frontier has only agreed to compensate us for $422.66 of this ticket cost as the delay was weather related. The refund was supposedly processed on 1/5/2023 but as of today, 1/28/2023 it still have not been processed. The complete lack of organization and communication has given us the worst travel experience ever."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cancun,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  It costs more for your baggage to fly than the people. Carry on + checked bag + seat assignment is $160 per person. Industry standard weight limit for checked bags is 50lbs - they drop it down to 40lbs and charge you an additional $50 if you're over that, which is damn near guaranteed. Then they charge you $3.50 for a soda and it feels like you're riding a not so well cared for bus. Flight delayed twice and we were told it was because they were having trouble finding crew to staff the flight. They have this scam pretty well figured out. Now you know to save yourself some aggravation and just fly one of the legit airlines. You're not saving any money here."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Phoenix,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First and last time flying with Frontier airlines on 01/05. I purchased tickets through Priceline in November for a straight through flight to Phoenix. The aircraft I was supposed to board with the flight number they gave me on my boarding pass was destined for Las Vegas and one of the Frontier ticket agents on that floor near the gate I was supposed to board at “fixed” my flight and their supposed error in the system. “You’re on the manifest for Las Vegas but not Phoenix let me call my manager and we’ll get this fixed”. I walked all over that airport to try and make this flight they changed the gate twice and had to go to the corrected gate after given the new boarding pass. Apparently, not that I was told, I was put on standby and after getting aboard and getting comfy was kicked off and then when they were kicking me off was told I was on standby. (And that they had overbooked the PHX flight and I was pushed to a flight to Las Vegas … with no second boarding pass from Las Vegas to Phoenix. how would that have even worked I wonder?) Apparently NONREV is for standby, I had no clue. No hotel voucher, however they did get me a flight the next day with a connecting flight in CO. The next morning that flight was delayed by like an hour but I was told by the ticket agent that I was on standby and it was a full flight so I just decided to go home, get some sleep and cry that whole weekend."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix Sky Harbor to Chicago O'Hare,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline I have ever flown on. They lost my wife's and I's luggage, delayed or cancelled every single flight we were on, and had awful customer service. We were going to a friend's wedding in Chicago and our original flight out of Phoenix was 'disrupted' by over 3 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight in Orlando. After standing in line for 3 hours in Orlando because they were severely understaffed to rebook our connecting flight, they told us the only flight we could get out on today was landing in the other Chicago Airport. We were told our luggage would make it there, but after arriving it never came. We filed a claim but lost all of our clothes and items needed for the wedding. When returning from Chicago they cancelled our flight and told me my only option was to travel to the other Chicago Airport and catch a flight there (which also ended up getting delayed). When arriving in Las Vegas (our layover) we attempted to get our boarding passes for our Phoenix flight. We found out the employee from Chicago cancelled our connecting flight and gave us a one way ticket to Las Vegas. When we explained the situation that it wasn't our fault, the employee said there was nothing he could do because the flight had been over sold by 17 tickets. We were placed on stand by for a flight I booked 3 months in advance because an employee messed up. I never write reviews but I hope someone reads this so they never experience the horrible business practices of Frontier. Spend the extra money for a reliable airline, I will never fly or recommend Frontier ever again."

The first time I flew with them boarding started and an alarm went off causing a 20 mins delay before boarding started back up. The second time flying with them, I was heading back to the military base where I am stationed and they refused to give a family pass to my mom because I am not ”leaving for deployment today” even though I’m scheduled to leave for a deployment soon. This is also the only airline that I have ever flown that doesn’t give active duty military the option to board early. Along with this the people I dealt with in getting my bags checked and boarding passes didn’t ask me how many bags I wanted to check - I wanted to check both bags but they went and printed only one tag without ever asking me) and were very rude towards me. Will not be flying this airline again. I’d rather pay a little more money to get the better service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,January 2023,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  One of the most horrible flying experiences you can have.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Atlanta,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," We arrived late to check in because of the horrific traffic situation at Cancun International Airport. It was 30 minutes until take-off. I had prepaid my large suitcase to be checked and of course they told me they could not check it. We were told the next flight was in 2 days, but we all had to be at work the next morning. We asked if they would put my bag on the next flight, They said no. We asked if they would ship it to me, I would pay whatever amount they put on it. They said no. They literally told me the only way we could get on the flight was to take our boarding passes, run for the gate and leave my bag there. We asked what do you mean leave it here. She said ""Throw it away"". I left it at the Frontier counter and ran for the plane. We got on. The pilots were stuck in traffic and didn't arrive for 90 minutes! I was not permitted to leave the plane to go back and get my car keys I left in my suitcase! No one would go to the counter and get them for me. A gate attendant boarded the plane, came to my seat and gave me a number to call once I got home. I called the number. It was to the airport lost and found director. He said they did not have my bag, to call the airline. I have contacted the airline by submitting a lost bag claim, chatting to an agent online (they have now closed down any customer service phone numbers) and they are telling me they do not have my bag, to call the airport. Vicious circle. I emailed the airline and asked what their policy was if there was a bag left unchecked at their counter. I was told Frontier had no policy regarding that, but the counter agent should have turned it into Lost and Found. Are they serious? No policy for an unattended, unchecked bag at an international airport check in counter? This is beyond outrageous. Talk about not having any concern for me, their customer. And on top of that no policy in place for the security of anyone coming through their check in counter. Stay away from this airline. It is not worth the cheaper ticket."

I said I wasn’t paying twice and asked for a refund on the fees which she explained I wasn’t entitled to a refund and gave me a card with a qr code explaining the refund policy.

Gate attendant extremely rude. Your personal item literally can't be bigger than a medium size purse. Extremely rude flight attendants. Constant confrontational attitude with passenger.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Rochester,January 2023,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  We bought our tickets in November in order to go on a direct flight from Orlando to Rochester. When we got into the airport there was no one there to help you on the kiosk machine. Our boarding pass would not load on the machine. We finally gave up on the kiosk machine and walked over to the baggage claim and asked them to help. They told us we should have taken a picture of the machine. We told them that there was nothing in the fine print that told you to take a photo. They told us our seats would be assigned at the gate. We walked up to the gate and asked them to assign a seat. They told us that they would be right with us. They told us we would have a seat in a few minutes. A half hour later they told us that the flight was overbooked and that we voluntarily needed to not be on the plane. So in order to get the better policy we had to say we voluntarily didn’t want to take the flight. Even though we had taken the flight because it was direct. They were rude and not listening to anything that was being said. We then were told to go back to the main frontier entrance because Jim would give us a check. We walked back to the front with a father and 15 year old daughter that were in the same position. We waited at the front desk for another 20 minutes for our checks. Once the checks came out they only gave the father and daughter one check because they said that the daughter should fly back to Rochester herself. It was never told at the gate that if they hadn’t taken the seat they would not be getting money. The agent at the gate was extremely rude and told us that is was none of our business what happens to the other couple because we were taken care of. She then walked away and never came back. I would have been ok until they wanted a 15 year old to fly home to Rochester alone.

We arrived in Phoenix only to see that our flight to San Francisco was cancelled. We went to the gate and were informed that were no more flights for that day and that the only thing they could do was to get us on a flight late the next day that would take TEN hours to get to San Francisco. We asked if they could put us on another airline: ""No, we don't do that"". We asked if they could pay for a hotel and/or meals: ""No, we stopped doing that in September"". The 4 gate agents were very immature and were goofing around and laughing with each other while they had a line full of very stressed out passengers. Looking around at the other airline counters showed an immediate contrast in professionalism compared to the absolutely ridiculous experience at the Frontier counter in Phoenix. We were given the option to get a refund on the portion of the trip we didn't fly, which we eventually took as we looked for other flights that we would need to spend MORE money on to get home. We ended up driving back home from Phoenix to Salt Lake City (which was a horrible experience for other reasons). We had our New Years weekend ruined by Frontier Airlines. We only had two days planned to spend in San Francisco. I will *NEVER* fly on a budget airline again. To summarize and add a few things: Baggage Fees: $65 and up each way for one bag. Allowed Free Item to Carry On: A small item such as a small purse or bag. Backpacks: No Laptop Bag: No. Talk to an Agent at the airport: $10 fee Reserve a seat: A fee. Support Phone Line: Refers you to CHAT online. There is NO customer service avenue where you can speak to a person over the phone. The phone says that it's website offers several ways to get a hold of customer service. Here is what they are: CHAT, EMAIL, and FILE A COMPLAINT."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Las Vegas,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Worst airline to fly. The seats feel like wooden seats with no cushion for back and neck. Leg space is almost nonexistent. And on top of it they made me pay 65$ for laptop bag because it wasn’t fitting inside their box.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orlenas to Philadelphia,January 2023,,,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I arrived early to check in early for my flight. I waited for 2 hours because I know it would be busy because it’s Martin Luther King day. There was no agent in their booth. I tried to message the Frontier Customer Service and the agent just left me hanging, telling me that she’s receiving a high volume of messages which is impossible because it’s a one on one chat. I’ll never fly with them again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Detroit,January 2023,3.0,4.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We boarded the plane, sat there almost an hour and then had to deplane because a pilot hadn't been scheduled. After a 3.5 hour hour delay we boarded again and the agents were very rude. They made us each go through and put our personal items in the bin to ensure they fit, even though we had done that earlier and everything fit then, but this was another waste of all of the passengers time."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,January 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My backpack fit in the measurement box at the gate, but they would not let me on the flight until I paid $99 for it claiming that the straps were too bulky. I have flown with the same backpack on Frontier with no problems, but the agent at this gate was particularly rude and aggressive. Half my flight had the same fate and were all shocked and angry. I filed a complaint through the website, and was given a mere $25 voucher for the inconvenience and ""sincere apologies"". Overall, this airline is terrible and I will avoid them at all costs. Customer service is awful at the gate. The only highlight was some of the flight attendants had a pretty good attitude."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"   I had to pay to get a seat after booking the ticket, I had to pay to take a carry on, I opted not to pay for the opportunity to speak to a representative and that was not smart with this cut rate airline. The unfriendly online booking put most of the emphasis on trying to get me to purchase a deal to get me cheaper rate, which I did and was it not applied. My TSA Pre-check was not applied either, but since I didn’t pay extra for the privilege of being able to call someone, I timed out on the chat several attempts and was unsuccessful in any contact after several hours of trying. There is no phone number to call after booking and if you don’t get the booking right online after paying so much extra for things included on economy airlines you are just out of luck. They boast about being a green airline, but that just means they have no customer service and a rude airline staff. They also nickel and dime customers for things that are normally included on reputable airlines. As unscrupulous as they are, I would be willing to bet Frontier starts charging for using the restroom in -flight. Never again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Miami,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Worst airline ever! My flight home was cancelled and Frontier did nothing but leave me and boyfriend stranded. I called several times and one of the people even hung up in my face. The next person I talked with wanted to charge me $950 to get my boyfriend and myself back home. What I couldn’t understand is why I would I have to pay when my flight was cancelled? This totally unfair and you shouldn’t treat your customers like this. I'll never book with you again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Orlando, FL to Cincinnati, OH",January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Frontier Airlines has been the worst airline company I've ever worked with. They have zero customer service and you will wait in line for hours to speak to someone. I missed a flight going from Orlando to Cincinnati because Frontier listed the incorrect gate number on our boarding passes. We waited at gate 111 for hours until I asked someone and they said our flight was actually leaving from gate 11 and our boarding passes were incorrect. We were late to the gate because Orlando airport is a mess and you will wait in the TSA line for hours at a time. Frontier did not care that they listed the wrong gate on our passes and were very rude about the whole situation. Then I waited in line for additional services at Frontier for hours before speaking to someone. They had 3-4 Frontier personnel working with people until right before 5 pm and then they all disappeared at one time and didn't return to the desk for over 40 minutes. I will never fly Frontier again, I would rather pay more and get better service. I highly recommend against this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Miami,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, My flight was delayed 3 times starting at 6pm. At almost 9pm the flight was cancelled with no flights departing until 2 days later. I was offered a $50 voucher with accommodations and every employee was rude! I was then given a “refund voucher” that had to take 7 business days to see if I was eligible even after the fact that Frontier cancelled on their end! I lost money on my original vacation hotel stay and was charged a fee for cancelling my car rental! This was the worst experience I have ever had!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Grand Rapids,December 2022,1.0,4.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,  Return flight cancelled 12/23/22. Tried to rebook. Made a mistake in booking 12/23 and immediately cancelled flight. Frontier took almost $900 out of my account for rebooking and guarantees full refund. I have not received a refund as of 1/14/22. I have yet to receive a refund for the cancelled flight home that was pre booked either. There are no Humans to talk to in customer service. Extremely poor service.
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Philadelphia,January 2023,5.0,1.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,3,  I fly Frontier very frequently and am an elite member so I am familiar with their onboard services. I fly from RDU to Philly every other other weekend and the flight is always 51-59 minutes. I flew up on the flight last night and was very pleased with the equipment. That flight is usually a A320 but last night was a sparkling A321 and the flight was right on time. I was disappointed with the flight attendants though. On this flight they do not routinely do a beverage service but sometimes they do. But they always at least will sell you something if you ring your call bell. I actually personally asked the flight attendants for service and was told that due to the short duration of the flight they could not serve me. I have taken this flight 16 times in the last 8 months and never was not or did not see service upon request. One more thing I observed was a young woman was going to the forward bathroom and the flight attendant refused her access to the bathroom and said we were landing in 2 minutes. We were at least 15 mins from landing and there was zero turbulence at that point. My feeling is this- they just did not want to get up and do their job and had a very dismissive attitude.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Orlando,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Terrible airline. Cheap tickets but not worth it because they will charge you fees. Horrible workers and customer service. Avoid at all costs! Horrible.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Phoenix,January 2023,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Talk about poor customer service policies and scheduling! My wife and I fly 2-3 times per year, and have flown with several different airlines over the years. Our recent experience with Frontier is the worst we have ever experienced. Our flight was scheduled January 2 from Ft Lauderdale to Phoenix. When we went to check in 24 hours prior to our flight, we found that our flight was rescheduled and was to depart 5 hours earlier than scheduled. No justification for the change was given, but luckily we were able to easily adjust our schedule, but many travelers were certainly not as flexible. When we arrived at the airport, we found that the flight was delayed an hour, and it was delayed again and was finally, unfortunately, canceled. Again, no justification was given. I noticed that another flight was about to leave for Phoenix in a half-hour. I spoke with the Frontier gate agent about getting on that next flight, and she said that was not possible because she wasn’t able to sell me a ticket. I said that we didn’t need other tickets; we just wanted to fly standby? Again, she said that wasn’t possible and said that we needed to reschedule our flight using their online chat. We found it very frustrating that Frontier didn’t have a phone number to speak with a real person (undoubtedly to save money). We spent the next 2 hours trying to reschedule our flight using their chat line, which was no help (again a way to save money). For example, unless you tap their chat line every minute you lose your connection and have to start all over again. In desperation, we finally visited the ticket counter and were able to reschedule our flight for 2 days later. We boarded our rescheduled flight, following 2 more delays. When we reached our layover in Atlanta, my neighbor told me that many airlines were compensating travelers for hotel costs and per diem because of canceled flights. I checked with the Atlanta's Frontier gate agent, and she said that I should have received a cancelation email and that I was supposed to handle this issue using their online chat. I told her that we didn’t receive a cancellation email (certainly a way to avoid compensating passengers), and I showed her my chat that said that I was supposed to contact an airline agent in person. Then, she gave me the old runaround and responded that I should have inquired about compensation at the Ft Lauderdale airport. Now I was real mad, and said that it shouldn’t matter what airport I was in, that they were all part of the same airline. I boarded the flight in frustration, vowing to never fly with Frontier again."

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Grand Rapids,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  On 12-30-2022 TPA TO GRR flight 2510 original flight departure time 4:36pm - delayed to 6:30pm, we understand that the weather was bad. We got to the airport early and there were no kiosks to print out our tickets and they would not pull up online. The lady at the checked bag counter could not get our tickets printed and was very rude. We almost missed our flight because they tried to make us get in line to check our bags even though we didn't have checked bags. They finally got them printed and we rushed to the gate. While standing in line the airline manager aggressively told our party that we needed to check 4 bags and we had too many. We talked to him in a reasonable way and he demanded that it at least we had to check 3 bags even if they were small enough to be personal items. He was very disrespectful and yelling loud enough to humiliate us in front of the other passengers. We showed him that our bags were small enough to fit as personal items, putting them into the personal item measurement tool. after we demonstrated the first bag fitting in the measurement tool he said ""I am not going to let you measure anymore, you have to pay for at least two bags or you can't get on the plane!"". After we proved the first one fit, he prevented us from measuring the other bags by standing in the way of the measuring tool. He told us that they would leave and we would miss our flight. He forced us to pay $198 to check two very small bags. He was so angry that he wouldn't let us on the plane two different times and the flight attendants and ladies at the gate had to re-open the door to the boarding bridge after he closed it. We got to the airplane and he closed the airplane door in front of us and said to stay there and wouldn't let us in again even though we paid so much for the two bags. They said they had to check and see if there was enough room on the plane, even though we purchased our tickets online a month in advance. The boarding passes already had our seat numbers on them (31 A, B and C). Then they changed our seats to (9 E, F, and G) there were so many empty seats that people took their un-checked bags and were putting them above other people's stowing areas because there was so much space. The all the rushing to make sure we paid our bags was pointless because the plane still was delayed another 30 minutes on the tarmac. We were polite and just wanted to make our flight. The lack of customer service was appalling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Denver,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The gate Manager hated himself and his job, you could tell by how he treated the customers including myself. I purchased Zone 1 tickets on the way to Denver & Zone 1 tickets on the way back to Tampa. I had a bad experience already because the plane departure was almost 2 hours late. Then the gate manager charged passengers 100$ for their backpacks. The manager follows me onto the plane to force me to move from my 550$ Zone 1 seat to zone 3. I was publicly embarrassed and mistreated by this staff. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to San Juan,January 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,  Service agents at Orlando are rude and with horrible attitude. Service agents tell you you are charged to get service even with their own system problems. Agents are on their cell phones on their work station. If you ask for service you are ignored and they overreact just not to service you. No supervision whatsoever. Walk away when see customers and the first word out of their mouth is how much you need to pay to get service from them instead of the basic how can I help you?

I have tried calling and using the online chat but no one answered. I have been waiting at the airport to speak with someone for over 2 hours. This airline has no accountability, they have lied numerous times. This is the worst airline."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," The flight attendants both ways, were inattentive, loud and unfriendly. On a flight from 1-5am they would not stop talking for a second and made sure the entire plane heard it. The seat quality is below poor, you can quite literally start taking the seat apart. The flight itself was fine, wouldn't travel through here again."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Raleigh,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  For starters this airline is supposed to be the cheapest airline to fly. The tickets themselves were moderately priced for the flight which was decent. However, the add ons such as checked baggage and seat selection are incredibly overpriced. It was an extra 500$ for both ways just to have seat selection and checked bags. This was the same price we paid for the plane tickets themselves. Our flight got delayed for over an hour. The baggage loading employees were severely understaffed. At first we saw that the wrong baggage vehicles were brought to the plane. Then eventually taken away, and returned with the correct ones. There was only 1 female loading the entire airplane by herself. This is something that a team should do. The flight staff didn’t seem to care about the delay. There was no accommodation, reimbursement, or incentive for us being so delayed. We paid for a flight to be on time and prepared. We didn’t pay this much for a late flight, or the delays. The food and drinks were outrageously expensive for tiny portions. Everyone on the flight were furious the entire time. And the staff just kept brushing it off because they knew that everything was ridiculous as well but they couldn’t do anything about it. On top of this the seats are the worst. Most uncomfortable seats ever. It would be more comfortable to sit in an old pick-up truck. Everyone was in discomfort and complaining the entire flight. Airlines have gotten worse and the only way to have a decent experience is if we pay thousands of dollars for a flight with adequate quality."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Hudson Valley,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Horrible experience! I booked ticket through Frontier website for my 80 yo mother to fly from Newburgh NY to Orlando FL. They didn't have any flights to Tampa airport which I live closer to so I booked it to Orlando which is 2 hrs from me. To start her flight home was cancelled a week after I booked ticket so I had to pick another day for her return flight. I checked flight status right up until we left for our 2 hour drive to Orlando it was still on time. We left at 3:30am so I could have her there 2 hours before her flight. We get to airport and the flight status changes from 8:10am takeoff to 9am. I waited with her on line for 3 hours to check her in. While on line the flight status changes again to 7pm takeoff. Now my mother had a ride if she was going to land in NY for the original time but being that her flight was delayed so long she will not have her 80 yo friend waiting for her to land. She will now have to pay for an Uber which will certainly cost a lot to get her home at night. I had to leave her there to wait because I have to go for radiation treatment for breast cancer back home where I live 2 hrs away from the airport. She is afraid they will again reschedule flight. Needless to say we are both so disgusted by the way we were treated. I had a woman that works for Frontier roll her eyes at me when I asked what my mother was supposed to do with a refund they offered her or a voucher. She needs to get home what is she supposed to do with a voucher?
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Fort Lauderdale, FL to San Diego, CA ",December 2022,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  Frontier delayed my bags for 2 days on a recent flight. I filed a claim before leaving the airport, and the gate agent told me he would input it into the system, so I handed him the claim (paper form). I asked who I could call to check on it and he gave me a phone number. The next day I hadn’t heard anything, so I called the phone number and they hung up on me - 3 different times. I then went to the online chat support and was told that a claim was never filed! I filed a claim online, followed up on it every single day for a week and still didn’t hear back. I now am trying to get reimbursement for my things that I had to replace, at first I just kept getting hung up on or when I use the online chat, agents stop responding. 3 days later, I had to physically go to the airport to check if my bag was there because I was never contacted that it had been found and was at the airport despite filing multiple claims (which it was, for who knows how long). When I finally did get a response (over 3 weeks later and only immediately after I posted a review of the airline online), I was told that “agents were responding in the order in which they received requests” (which I know is a lie because I only received a response after posting a negative review), and that my items cannot be reimbursed? I had to buy a whole new car key because mine was locked in my luggage and they won’t reimburse me. This is truly unacceptable customer service and I can hardly believe they can get away with treating people like this. I will never be flying with them again, and would advise you not to if you can at all help it, because god forbid something should go wrong (even if it’s their fault), you will not receive any help or resolution."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Las Vegas, NV to Denver, CO",January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had a terrible experience in the summer where I paid about $1,200 for two tickets to CO to FL to visit family. We were supposed to arrive at about 5.40 am but because of issues with weight and fuel they kept us herded on the plane for hours before telling us we need to move to another plane at a different gate. So many people missed their connections because the second flight also had about an hour delay. We landed at about 8.40 am. Flying from Denver to Las Vegas this time we were delayed about an hour. This time now we have ""On Time"" listed for a 6.48 pm departure and were to be boarded at 5.53 pm. It is now 6.29 pm and we have yet to start calling zones. What is wrong with your system? And your monopoly charges for bags is insane. The flights are always so uncomfortable and they charge for everything. Simply the worst airline. My fiancé and I got a credit email from the CO to FL, went to use it for this flight and it said the credit does not exist. Absolutely pathetic company, not even going to try to call them given my previous experiences. Some of us only have Frontier for certain flights so it's a shame that they're this terrible for those forced with no other options but to literally drive to destinations other airlines besides Spirit (which is just as bad) do not go through. If you're seeing this or care, listen to the people and get yourself in order with flight times and actually credit people when you mess up. "

When we arrived to the airport we were checked in for our flight. Apparently we were the only passengers they checked in for the flight. The passengers who came early and didn't read the delay email were turned around and given a resort voucher. We however, were stuck in the airport with no Frontier representatives for 4 hours trying to figure out what was going on.

They boarded the plane and we sat there for over 2 hours. They then made everyone get back off the plane and canceled the flight due to not having a ""full"" tank of potable water for the 2 hour flight. I had to buy a different flight and they refused to refund the ticket but instead said go to dinner and use your credit card to pay for it and they'd reimburse that cost. Then as I'd already purchased a round trip flight I had to fly back to work with them on new year's day. Again they loaded the plan and made everyone sit there for over 2 hours because this time they had no crew for the flight that they charged everyone for. I ended up being late returning to work. Frontier airlines is a joke. They may start out being cheaper than other airlines but you'll end up paying for another airline anyway and at a much higher rate as they cannot manage to make one flight on time so you'll be forced to buy a last minute ticket elsewhere if you actually want to get where you plan/need to go."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New York,January 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  On Monday, January 2nd, I departed from Montego Bay Jamaica and had a connecting Frontier flight from Orlando, FL (MCO) to Providence, RI (PVD). My flight (Flight 1182) began boarding at 2:23 PM and I arrived at the appropriate “bag drop” area for Frontier domestic flights with more than adequate time to drop my checked bags and head to security. However, the line for bag drop was longer than the intended space to hold waiting flyers and moreover, there was only one frontier agent working to check bags in when the area had five working stations. I was still waiting in line when my flight began boarding and finally made it to the front of the line at 2:37 PM. When I got to the front, the agent told me it was too late and that I had to rebook across the hall. I headed to the redirected area where there were already 3 families complaining to the supervisor due to their flights being cancelled by Frontier. When I was finally addressed, I was told that the next available flight to Providence was Wednesday, the next flight to Boston (closest city to Providence) was Thursday, and that I could not get a refund for the inconvenience. In the end, I had no choice but to rebook a flight to LaGuardia (Flight F9 1334) upon which I had to pay an additional $99. This inconvenience has cost me over $500 in unexpected expenses as I now have to arrange for transportation to get to Providence, RI from Queens, NY. The unprofessionalism and disregard for flyers by the Frontier employees at MCO is unacceptable and I will not be flying with this airline in the future."

From a half hour delay because no one was working the baggage check line, to a cabin that was 80°, then while sweating being told we have to wait for another in the hot plane because the taxi wasn't ready to bring us to the gate, to finally over an hour delay just to get our bags from baggage claim. Not to mention the seats in front of you being so close you can't take your knee out of back of the person in front of you or being told everything costs, even water. This 4 hour flight took over 6."

Then we waited at the baggage claim for 3 hours. I never received my baggage. I entered a claim and didn’t hear back for 48 hours and then my bag was delivered to the wrong location twice. When I got my bag it was broken and the wheels had come off. I finally got my bag the day before I had to return. Customer service refused to reimburse me for clothes for the week and refused to credit the $64 baggage charge. Terrible experience.

Good luck getting anyone on the phone, they make you do a chat but no one answers. Their check-in counter opens only two hours before a flight so you and the entire plane of people are all waiting in line to get checked in and delayed in getting through security. Delays to and from on our trip, they couldn't find the pilots, literally that's what they said over the intercom. Then when we landed another plane was in our spot so we had to wait again! They do not run efficiently, not worth saving the money plus they hit you with lots of fees, for bags to check in at the counter its ridiculous!"

However, the man by the gate Yanked my bag out of the measuring device and tried to stuff it in sideways. Since it didn't go in smoothly the way he was putting it in he charged me $99. I asked him his name and he began to yell at me. In order to prevent this humiliation and exorbitant cost from occurring again, I prepaid $64 for my personal item for the return trip. I felt disrespected and cheated by these matters. This same man was also yelling at all the other passengers who were trying to board and were trying to act respectfully. "

This airline is clearly trying to compete and can’t do it earnestly. Many thanks to the airline staff doing their best to help when they can only do so much. Especially the flight attendants. My little 18 month wasn’t so happy and she was made priority. So thankful for that. I’m talking to the higher ups. Clearly you haven’t worked from the bottom up and think you can regulate this airline with no knowledge of how the skies work. Maybe you’re just starting and trying to work your way up as I am in my profession. Your business is people. How they make it to and from their home. The love and cosy feeling as if you haven’t left the comfort of home. Frontier Airlines is far from it. I guarantee they are on a fast track to recover from deficit taking advantage of the working class that provides many a tickets for these biscuits. Thank you to the flight attendants once again and flight staff for getting us home safely.

Offered a flight to Chicago with no guaranteed flight to Cleveland. Offered us a flight to Orlando at 930pm with a possible connecting flight at 530am from Orl to cle. Would not pay for hotels. Could not guarantee final destination up to 2 days out. Some people were told to drive to Cleveland from Chicago. Then told to call frontier for reimbursement. Knowing there is no one to call. Other airlines offered one way flights for $650. Flying with 7 this was not an option. No guarantee of frontier even reimbursing for those flights. Basically we can get you part way to your final destination. The worst customer service system I have ever felt with.  I’ll pay double before I fly this low budget rip off airline"

Next thing they will do is add a charge to fasten your seatbelt. When you call them they direct you to their instant message chat in which the responsiveness is less than desirable. Very frustrating you can't talk to an actual human over the phone. I think they intentionally do it to screw their customers. Originally was booked to fly out of Philadelphia then ended up having to drive all the way to Cleveland to get a flight.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Ft Lauderdale,November 2022,4.0,4.0,,,,4.0,3,no,4,"  First - Expedia was unable to help - Frontier won't allow them system access. I can't express enough how awful this Experience has been. On the day of our flight we had to cancel one of our 3 round trip tickets from BUF to FLL and back. We called 800-616-9631 (Frontier CS #) because the website would not allow us to cancel one of the tickets. We spoke to the agent who understood the request and advised there would $150 fee for the cancelation but i would receive a voucher to use on a future flight. I wasn't expecting a voucher so this was good. We thought we were all set until my wife checked her and my sons tickets on the way to the airport 2 hours away from our house, the agent cancelled all three tickets! Let the nightmare begin. My wife called 800-616-9631 immediately and was on the phone for 50 minutes with someone who was telling her they were working on getting the flight reinstated. The person that answered asked her to pay for the flight and she told them she was not going to pay for anything additional since the two flights never should have been cancelled, that was an error on their end. My wife kept being told that she would get a call back and they were working on getting the two flights reinstated. Once she got to the airport she was told to go to the Frontier ticket counter, and they would be able to help. When she got to the counter she spoke to a wonderful manager with Frontier named Jill. Jill checked to see what happened and saw the entire reservation was cancelled and there was nothing she could do until they reinstated the flight reservations. My wife called #800-616-9631 again and the person that answered spoke to Jill and assured her they were working on reinstating the reservation and would call back in 30 minutes, at this time there was less than an hour left until the flight was taking off. They never called back so my wife had to make the decision to buy 2 new tickets (one way) from Frontier ( $370.96), If she had waited any longer and they didn't reinstate her flight, they would be stranded. They got through security and to the gate and never received a call from anyone about the flight reinstatement. my wife called back numerous times before they got on the plane and no one answered. Once they landed in Fort Lauderdale she called again, a person answered and told her that the flight on Monday would be reinstated and she would be reimbursed for the $370.96 she had to pay for the flight, but she had to call 801-401-9000. My wife asked if they would be able to help her right then as it was after 11PM and was told yes.. She called the number and it was for Frontier airlines and they only accept calls Monday-Friday. Such poor customer service! Once she got to the destination she called #800-616-9631 again numerous times and was hung up on twice and no answer the other times. For peace of mind she booked a new flight for her and my son because she had no confidence they would reinstate the original reservation. This flight cost her $443.96. This whole experience was horrible and what should have been a relaxing 3 vacation turned into an incredibly stressful situation. This was a simple request. Original flight - $ 527.88 One way to FLL from Buffalo for two - $370.96 One way to Buffalo from FLL for two - $ 443.96 One flight cancelation fee $150 - I was told i'd be credited within 10 days, but it's been over a month and I'm still waiting."

I understand ultralight chairs for fuel efficiency but that was hellishly uncomfortable. Not reclinable, virtually no padding on the seat, and no padding on the back rest at all. No room to the sides. No room in front. After a 4h 30min flight I was sore for a whole day. All the rest is what you can expect from a cheap company. You pay less, you get less, sure. The crew was even nice, maybe even sympathetic. However, never again for the extreme discomfort."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Orlando,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I traveled on frontier to see my parents out of necessity. My dad is sick so the travel was last minute and because of the holidays the flights on my preferred airlines (Delta and Southwest) were booked. We paid $500 for the tickets on frontier. Unfortunately, the return trip our flight was canceled 20 minutes prior to departure (after they had delayed it several times) because of weather. I completely understand that this happens and is just a function of flying to a state that gets a lot of snow. However, when we asked the gate agent about our options, we were told we could not rebook a flight for 2 weeks because all of their flights had been oversold because of the cancellations. I asked if the agent could look at other airports nearby and I even showed him an open flight I had found and he said that even though it looked like I could book it online, it wasn’t eligible to o be booked because of the cancellation. When I very kindly explained that 2 weeks was really too long to wait, he said he would recommend a refund. When I explained that I really didn’t want that and asked again for him to check and see if there was anything in the next couple of days, another gate agent started openly mocking me. She pretended to cry and told me to get over it, weather happens and I shouldn’t travel if I’m not prepared to deal with the consequences. Neither my husband nor I was crying or being pushy in any way and the response was so heartless and cruel I told them to just refund us. We then went on to call Southwest who miraculously pulled some strings and got us on a next day flight. The one way tickets were $600 but so worth it. (I love Southwest always and forever.) After all of that, Frontier is now refusing to refund the full amount of our ticket because we “didn’t cancel within 24 hours”. I am baffled. They canceled the flight. We have a copy of the notification saying they cancelled the flight due to weather and they still are saying that they can only give us a partial credit. I looked into it and they don’t have to do anything if they don’t want to. So we are out over $1000 for the tickets back and the original flight that never left the airport. It does not matter how cheap the tickets seem, it is never ever worth it to fly this airline. Please believe me and avoid them at all costs."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,December 2022,2.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  6am flight from Atlanta , GA to Chicago, IL. Frontier had a few flights this morning leaving at 6am. There was a Denver, CO, and a Baltimore MD. The only reason I know this is while I was waiting in line to check my bags ( here were a lot of people behind me in line) all of the sudden everyone going to Denver Co leaving at the same time as me got to skip the line. The whole line and check in. Ok no problem, I’ll still make my flight I got here on time like a responsible adult. 25 mins go by and now hey everyone on the Baltimore MD flight, yea you guys go ahead and skip the whole line and check in. Keep in mind they have the same exact boarding time as me. So then now I have to wait behind literally everyone for no reason other than they should make their flight and I shouldn’t. So I go through the entire line. I get to the front desk, 30 mins left before they stop boarding my flight. Give them my military ID to check my bags, they then look at me and saw we are no longer accepting Chicago. You are going to have to re book your flight. 30 mins still left to board keep in mind. I have to get to Chicago today. Currently trying to get a least a refund for my flight and messaging an agent for frontier but they no longer have a phone number that you can call. Was told I was transferred to another rep. Been waiting to be transferred for 20 mins now. I had to book a flight for 700 plus dollars and as I type this the frontier rep disconnected and did not transfer me. I will never fly Frontier again. You cannot ask for worse service. "

Asked to speak to a supervisor and she just refused to reply to my chat forcing me to open another so someone else would have to speak with me. So disrespectful.

Seeing as we don't even fly once per years this was only purchased to allow for cheaper air fare. The discount den purchase was not refunded and am now out $99 because the airline canceled our flight and had no other options for us. Highly recommend against.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Nashville,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,yes,1,"  The worst experience I've ever had with an airline. We had a return flight from Nashville to Denver. First of all, we had a delay at the booking counter (there was no structure, whatsoever, all passengers were bundled up, no lines for boarding, even though we paid the extra few $’s for priority boarding, seeing that we have a baby and to not have to stand in lines for ages - this wasn’t the case!) The staff - from beginning to end were unfriendly, miserable, unhappy people. There was little to no communication on why we were so delayed - starting with boarding then we had to wait another 1,5 hours onboard - before take off. Cabin crew were a nightmare in my opinion. Unfriendly, biggest attitudes, one specific lady was on her cellphone the whole time. The pilots were out of the cockpit and into the lavatory more than I have ever seen. When announcements were made the speakers were so loud, you almost jumped out from the plane as a fright. We also attempted to order a few snacks on the plane, they should just scrap this option from the list. Most of the items we asked for was not on the plane, also some of the items were paid for then the crew member came back and said “sorry we are out of stock”.  We just paid for that, now you are telling me there is no stock, we were sitting in the 3rd row. Upon arrival, having checked in our baby stroller, my husband had to wait a mere 20mins for the stroller at the door also being asked to move. To say the least we were very dissatisfied with the service (if that is even called service). Needless to say if we hadn’t booked our return flights already, we SURE as HELL wouldn’t have used FRONTIER AIRLINES to get back home. After a visit to family, we put the first flight behind us and said the return flight will go well.  Biggest mistake ever. At check in of luggage it all started. Firstly if your bag tag machine doesn’t have enough paper to print the tags, do not fight with your passengers and give them attitude when they ask for assistance. Secondly, now we have to stand in a line for (not kidding 40minutes) to get one bag tag printed because we cannot use the self help desk as it doesn’t allow (because apparently it was printed already - WITH NO PAPER). Time for boarding, you guessed it - another delay - 50 minutes at the gate, with again little to no communication as to what is happening. Oh and yes, the staff - lets not go there. This plane also took off a full 55 minutes after scheduled time. Again the announcements over the intercom was pathetic, it was like we were being yelled on from pilot to cabin crew. Like seriously, we all have speakers right above our heads, stop yelling. We finally made it to Nashville. Here we were greeted with another welcomed delay - at the baggage collection. By this time it wasn’t even a surprise anymore. This airline will never see me, nor my family ever again. Worst experience ever. Worst time management. Worst communication."

They made us come to the airport at 6am saying the flight was on time during the snow storm, checked out bags in for $80 bucks and then sent us our way to the gate. We waited an hour to find out that the flight was cancelled with no rebooking. Now almost 5 hours later we our still waiting to get the bag that we checked in the morning back. There is absolutely zero staff here let alone any help from the check out counter. I wish I could rate this airline with negative stars.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Baltimore,December 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I have been using Frontier almost every other week before COVID. I planned to spend the holiday (Christmas & New Year) with family members in Virginia, and we had the cheapest possible flight Denver to Baltimore, car rental booked without cancellation option. The day before our flight day the weather was bad, but the next day was no reason to cancel flights, but Frontier did. My compliant is not the cancellation, but there is no option to arrange to fly on the next flight. The flight next to us to the same destination on the same day which is just in about 4 hours difference was not cancelled. The only option we had was to have refund. As you all know the time is a holiday season, it is not easy to find flight with a reasonable price. The funny part is Frontier also have flights when you search to purchase. The plan we had for more than two months, the vacation time planned, the craving the kids had to see New York at the new year eve was taken away (stolen) by Frontier. If the flight price is in cents, I will not consider Frontier. The service they provided was not acceptable, and the pain they caused on my kids is unforgivable."

I didn’t need to check in because I had all personal items. In my email it was said to go to kiosk because they didn’t have my boarding passes available online. As I walk to the line to speak to a representative I’m told that I have to pay $25 just got them to print out a ticket that was never sent to me. Luckily, the same employee recommended I download the app to get my ticket off of there so that’s what I did to avoid the cost. Going through TSA was a breeze compared to what we had to endure while walking up to that gate. Next, there are already announcements from other airlines that all flights to Chicago were canceled. Frontier gave us the run around, changing our gates multiple times, to delaying our flight, having us board then deplaned not mentioning to us that we are actually cancelled. If I didn’t speak to other members on the plane I would’ve been lost on where to go with my 2 small children. We met the agent with the nastiest attitude not being apologetic not considerate of what we all had to put up with. They denied us any vouchers for food and hotel because they had a later flight coming out which eventually got canceled at 5:30 being it was suppose to take off at 11:30pm.

They now force every single guest to check their personal item in the sizer and then will force you to pay $100 because it won’t fit. I’ve used the same small duffle bag for years in every airline as a personal item because it fits perfectly under the seat and meets the size requirements mentioned online. Frontier will charge you unless your personal item is a tiny purse. My flight was also extremely delayed with no updates because of a maintenance issue after the pilot claimed maintenance cleared us to go then we all had to get off the plane. Please stop flying with them so they get the message. The staff are extremely rude, and honestly I can’t blame them because they have to enforce extremely strict and awful policies all day that upset paying customers."

They had a Black Friday sale the following week. They wouldn’t give me the $250 difference. There’s a now seven-hour delay. They just let you sit in the airport all day. I’ve lost a day of my vacation and I can’t adjust it on the back end because I have to be back at work. Frontier is not worth the headache.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,December 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I got to the airport 3 hours early just in case. I paid for my bag in advance to save time, but when I got to the frontier window, the line was so long that I couldn’t see where it ended. The line just to hand over your bags was 45 minutes. It’s finally my turn and my bag is 49 lbs. I was then notified that while the industry standard is 50 lbs, Frontier has recently changed it to 40 lbs. I was given 2 options, to pay $50 for the 9 lbs, after already having paid almost $70 just t I check a bag in the first place, or I can take items out and hold them in my hands for the duration of the trip. I ended up taking 1/4 of my clothes out and draping them over my arm. The line for security I can’t blame on frontier as it was a mix of all airlines, but that took an hour and a half. But with all of that extra weight in my arms, my body was in severe physical pain. At this point I have 15 minutes to get to my gate, so I’m running like a bat out of hell. I have really bad asthma but I ran anyway. I get to my gate and someone tells me that they switched to a completely different terminal and didn’t update the app or my eticket. I now had 7 minutes to take the concourse to a different terminal and then run 16 gates to get to mine. I get there right when the door was supposed to close, but they were held up harassing people about their carry on bags so it wasn’t too late. I get to the counter clothes in hand and my jansport backpack as my personal item. I was told that frontier considers anything bigger than a purse is a carry-on and that the fee is $99.00.  I finally get to my seat, trying to breath, dripping sweat, red like a tomato, sore and exhausted. The moment my butt hits the seat everyone’s phones go off “flight delayed 2 hours.” An announcement on the speaker “sorry everyone, we need to de-plane, we are not sure why.” It’s 6:00 am and we are unloaded. At 6:15 once everyone gets off they say never mind and have everyone get back on. Apparently the pilot did not have the appropriate paperwork he needed for flight which is why we needed to get off. This is the worst experience I have had traveling and with an airline. All the disgusting money grabs are horrendous, from dropping allowed bag weight, restricting the size of a personal item, and hiking up costs. A checked bag at any other airline is $30, frontier is about $70. A personal item is free with other airlines, frontier claims personal items are carry-on’s and charge $99.00. I’m in so much physical pain right now from having to carry so much, from sprinting repeatedly, and getting off and on. Once we finally took off the stewardess had the audacity to thank us for flying with the worlds greatest airline. The audacity."

Frontier decided to leave my luggage in Miami on Monday due to plane weight issues and I have not received a call or update as to its status or whereabouts. Your associates are going above and beyond as to avoid doing their jobs to get me my belongings which includes my infant's item. Worst airline experience and very unprofessional.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Phoenix,December 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,  They messaged twice that there was going to be a delay on 21st of dec 2022 for flight evening of 21st. Initially one hour then 2nd message was 2hrs so decided to get another flight since thought this one was going to be cancelled. Well right after I purchased another flight they sent a third message that the flight was going to be on time. I tried to call customer service and figure out what to do with this situation and if I could get refunded since they messaged delay which urged me to get new ticket. They said no that they would not refund since now back to on time! I can’t believe them. Will never fly with Frontier ever again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Denver via Orlando,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I've flown several budget airlines - Spirit, EasyJet, RyanAir, Norwegian and normal airlines Delta, Wingo, Avianca, China Air, Alaska, Southwest, etc - and without a doubt Frontier takes the cake for the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of flying on. It isn't just a flight being delayed (that happens to all airlines, often for reasons beyond their control) or the insistent and unapologetic effort to milk you for every penny, but the complete lack of communication, unprofessional staff, and the general chaos associated with all aspects of Frontiers operation. No one seems to know what's going on or what should be going on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Dallas via Denver,December 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  This was the worst flight I have ever been on. I had to repay for a checked bag I paid for in Seattle due to a booking era but that bag weighed 34.4 in Seattle cost me 79.00 in Denver for the same bag same weight when I asked about this because the website said bags under50 lb was 30.0. I was the told by a very rude customer service women that was that was what Frontier charged. No other explanation. Every person I can in contact with was rude or dismissive. Then I had my luggage and everyone had luggage lost I had to wait for half an hour hope I did not miss my connection flight half hour later I got. At that time my lock tsa approved lock was still on my bag which contained all my grandkids Christmas gifts in it. But by the time my family picked me up in Dallas my lock was gone and the bag had clearly been gone through. Frontier do better with hiring customer service people that actually want to help people. I will never take this airline again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Las Vegas,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  It was the worst experience I have ever had! The tickets are low but they will charge you for carry-ons bags so the flight would not be as cheap. If you want to print tickets, the company would charge you $25 for each. Horrible customer service, horrible pilots, just overall horrible experience. The flight took 6.5 hours instead of 4 hours as it was saying on the ticket. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers  to Cleveland ,December 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Customer service was absolutely awful. Each interaction I had with Frontier Airline I wasn't impressed. They were all so rude. First thing I needed was my boarding pass and the front desk lady was very rude, I was needing help because their APP wasn't allowing me to open my boarding pass. So as I'm explaining this to customer service, she proceeds to tell me we're not even checked in treating me badly when on my phone I have actual proof I checked in the previous night. She ripped the boarding passes out of the printer and told us to run because our flight was about to leave us. So we were in complete panic mode. Trying not to miss our flight when we get to our gate there's a line to our plane we had plenty of time. This was my three-year-old's first time flying so I asked the flight attendant if she could please sit with me because our seats were not together, and she rolled her eyes right in front of me, and walked away. She came back and rudely said Yeah it's fine I had to go let them know. Customer service is not that hard if you can't handle it then don't work it!"

Horrible experience. I will never book with this unprofessional airline ever again. Frontier is more like Low Tier at this point. It’s a cheap option, but believe me you’d rather pay more to save yourself from unethical and unprofessional airlines."

I will never fly this airline again after the way I was so disrespectfully talked to and the way that I was treated by their incompetent employees. I have never been talked down to or disrespected in such a horrible way. Ended up having to pay $600 on another airline to get home. Then they lost my luggage and would not even begin to help reimburse me for my travel cost when their delay of my flight for over hours made 20 passengers miss their connection. My luggage with original personal items is lost and one airline employee in Hartford said “I don’t know why you’re mad about your luggage being lost”.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Nashville ,December 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Yep, the worst possible airline. Customer service is guaranteed 24/7 on their website, yet non existent. I even tried to talk to two employees, both of whom told me that they could not provide customer service for at least another 2 hours. There is no telephone number that is answered, they communicate via chat only, but I've tried eight times to talk with a representative, only to have them disappear. I will never fly this airline again, It's simply not worth the discounted rate."

Today I leave out of the San Diego International airport to Phoenix AZ, and they are having every single person size their bags while not even accepting bags that FIT IN THE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL SIZER!! There were at least 8 people (including me) that had to pay $100 for a CARRY ON. The people checking everyone in were extremely rude and did not take a second to listen to anyone regardless of the fact that many people were on their returning flights and did not plan to get charged $100 for a bag as they did not get charged on the first flight. My card dropped when I was handing it to one of the ladies because I was shaking so much and she threatened to add a note to my account to make sure I would never fly with frontier again. This all happened right before Christmas too. They are extremely money hungry because no one wants to fly with the, and they have lost all customer service value. Even sitting on the flight after getting charged, there is no AC and they proceed to say “we are aware that it is hot in the aircraft but touching the AC dials will not help…” DO NOT FLY FRONTIER"

Get there no one is there but someone in line said he just a email that gate and concourse had been changed again. So we looked at the board and it had so we went back only to get there and they said it was delayed 30 minutes. Needless to say we were supposed to start boarding at 8:15 and boarding stop at 8:44 but at 12:15 we get told our plane was cancelled. No communication in between except between all the people waiting. Very few people was getting emails . Then we was told we could either get a refund or rebook. So I wanted to rebook and I was one of the first ones in line. All of us was asking for hotel vouchers and food vouchers and staff was very rude and said that they were told not to do anything but refund or rebook. Then I heard some people after I left was told they were getting hotel vouchers on their emails. My rebooking has me stuck in Atlanta for 2 more nights at a hotel then I fly to Las Vegas only to have an 18 hour layover there. I’ve tried serval ways to get in touch with someone but they have cut all ties with the public except for Facebook or Twitter but they still don’t talk to you. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Orlando,December 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Do not waste your $$$$. Frontier chat agent canceled my reservation for the departing flight in error forcing me to repurchase a new departing ticket for twice the cost and offered no remedy for the original flight cost.  Looks inexpensive when you book but they charge for anything and everything. The seats are tiny and uncomfortable and if you don’t pay a big fee to pick your flight they cram you in like a sardine to the least desirable seat on the plane I was in the last row in front of the bathroom, in a “window” seat that had no window and no overhead bin space. Details I was interested in leaving a day early for my trip so I reached out to Frontier via chat (only option for customer service) and learned I couldn’t change the departing flight without incurring $99 fee plus the flight cost difference of $9. Since the new departing flight was only $47 I asked if it was possible to cancel the departing flight without impacting the return flight, the chat agent confirmed it was possible and asked if I would like to cancel it. I asked if I could do that myself on the website once I decided whether to rebook the departing flight, which had gone up to $78 while i was waiting over an hour for customer service. The chat agent confirmed I could do it myself and said she’d send a link. Instead I got an email that appeared to shown my departing flight was no longer part of the reservation. I chatted again and was told the departing flight was cancelled. I explained what happened and they said there was nothing they could do and refused to help me or connect me with a manager then just stopped answering my chats. So I ended up having to pay twice as much to get a departing flight and lost the $ from my original booking. Worst customer service I’ve ever received from an airlines."

They simply did not care. When on the way home, our flight was delayed, delayed and then cancelled. That was bad but things happen. When they basically refused to tell me how I was supposed to get home, offered zero empathy and said not their problem. When I asked about an email that I had received telling me the flight was not cancelled just further delayed, they were rude and said, I don’t know what to tell you. The flight is cancelled. I don’t get an email. I am not a screamer, it is not their fault, but sine human decency goes a long way. We will never fly this airline again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Atlanta to Portland via Phoenix,December 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Don't fly Frontier. Our flight was originally supposed to be at 08.40pm. We drove 3.5 hours to Atlanta to get the flight cheaper due to local airlines coating 1K or more for regional. When arriving to the gate we were told the aircraft has no gate at that time and to stand around waiting for an announcement. Then the aircraft was delayed until 10.30 for maintenance issues. Our gate was then changed but still no plane was present and there was no staff at the gate. The flight was delayed again until 12.30 midnight. Once 1 am rolled around we the flight was cancelled. The staff informed us only 30 minutes after the site stated the cancellation and provided no follow up. Upon pressuring the staff we waited an hour to get re-booked a flight that is 3 days away. They stated they would provide hotel vouchers via email. Apparently they had already been aware that it was likely the aircraft would not show up and decided to delay the flight multiple times and change the gates instead. When arriving to the hotel no voucher was emailed. We attempted to call their customer service and was hung up on repeatedly. Their chat services decided to call us only to tell us the voucher would arrive for a 3 night stay within 30 minutes. No voucher was emailed. Calls continued to be made and contact with live representatives was made only for them to hang up after I kindly got one sentence out. Don't fly with this airline. It's basically a scam and they don't care at all. So we'll be in a hotel for 3 nights out of our own pocket.

No email or no change in the app. Then waited in 2 hours worth of a line to find out our flight back home was re-booked til 3:50pm the next day. I work at a hospital in Massachusetts so I had to take another day off of work. We were lucky enough to find a place to stay in Orlando (of course not offered by the airline) for that night our flight was cancelled. Then found out at 11am our flight was delayed to 6:45pm that day. We went to the airport, it surprisingly took off that same day however, they made us pay for a carry on that we did not have to pay for before. They charged us 99$ for this stupid thing when they literally cancelled our flight the day before and didn’t tell us. Will never fly this airline ever again. Worst experience."

We were all directed to a new 2 hour line to re-book our flights. Thats when it went from bad to worse, we were told theres nothing until Dec 19th and our only options were to either get on that flight 2 days later or get a refund. Since no one was notified about the cancellation of this flight it was now too late to try and find a fligh, and the only options available bow had overlays and for my particular case had to pay an unexpected $1300 dollars with a different airline. To make things worse the refund wont be available on my card for up to 5 business days, making really hard for some ppl to afford this. "

First of all, the flight was delayed for more than three hours and no one even cared to apologize. Second, the assistant are plain rude and disrespectful. Many of us had to pay 90 dollars for a carry on just because we had a bag with an item we purchased at the airport. Just pay the extra dime and avoid this airline. I think they are trying to copy Southwest but without the politeness, the customer service quality, and with employees that do not respect customers. This airline is simply a disgrace. While I don't usually write reviews, I felt compelled to write this one to save someone else from going through what my wife and I went through. "

Please dont consider this airline and especially dont include Frontier in any of your holiday or any key travel plans. If you do, do it at your own risk. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,December 2022,3.0,4.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My girlfriend and I were boarding a flight from Orlando to Philadelphia. We were both told to check out backpacks for size restrictions. After dropping my bag into the size container the attendant cleared me to proceed to scan my ticket. My girlfriend was requested to pay for her bags. I went ahead and scanned my ticket and stood aside and told the ticket agent I would like to wait for my girlfriend to finish ticketing before stepping into the jet bridge. There was an argument at the ticket counter between the attendant and another customer. As my girlfriend was finishing paying for her baggage online the attendant (emotionally) told the ticket agent to close the door. Everything happened so fast that I was not able to remind the ticket agent, that I was still waiting for my girlfriend. We both were denied from getting on the flight along with 8 other people who were waiting in line to get on the plane. I was shocked at the customer service and rudeness of the agent to me (after the incident) and others was unreal. I have never witnessed such poor management and communication between Frontier Attendants. After the incident the attendant continued to argue with the majority of the folks who missed the flight because they were still standing in line. During one of the arguments the attendant explained how the PA system overrides any type of Frontier notifications received via text. At one point arguing and demonstrating how the PA system works. With the P/A system activated for the entire airport to hear the discussion. "

In spite of the fact that our party of 10 people all missed the flight because they told us to go to a different gate, and we walked up and said we are here for the Cedar Rapids flight and they said oh they haven’t boarded. Only to find out the plane took off. We were told by multiple frontier employees that the flight had not left, and it was the app where we realize that we had already missed the flight. We were also told that it would be next,. We could not get a straight answer from anyone."

We carried on one bag each (there were two of us) and bags were the size specified on Frontiers web site. When we checked in they made us place our 2 bags in a smaller than specified on the web space and charged us an extra 99 dollars per bag to board. This is false advertising. We could have flown American or United for what we ended up paying and would have had we known Frontier had a screw the customer policy. There were many others having the same problem. Our bags fit under the seats just fine but we got the Frontier bait and switch screwing and as said previously will never fly with them again.

When I wrote multiple emails to Frontier they made excuses about charging due to the size of the bag. I was NEVER asked to size my bag. They charges my card without my knowledge. When I explained this through an email (because you can NEVER find a real person to speak to on the phone), they continued to make excuses and denied a refund.

The airline kept delaying the flight every single hour, until they finally told us the flight will be leaving at 2.23pm. We are finally ready to take off, the pilot announced that there's something wrong with some circuit. Therefore, we had to wait until the circuit is fixed. It was 4pm in the afternoon inside the aircraft without AC or water. Everyone was dying of heat and frustration. It was 4pm when we took off to our destination Atlanta, which was too late to connect with our flight to MSP Minnesota. No one was there to help us with our connecting flight. And you can only communicate with Frontier Customer Service using the APP CHAT. No help was offered to us and had to purchase three tickets from our pockets to get back home that same evening to Fort Lauderdale.

Hopefully everyone can read my comment before making that purchase/mistake. Thank you for reading!"

Pay the little bit extra, because you will anyway, to fly a decent airline. The hidden fees eventually add up to sometimes more than a flight on an all around better airline.

On the return flight, flight was over 1 hour late. After attempting to board they stopped me because they said my backpack was too big to be a personal item. Same backpack I had no issues with arriving and same backpack I use every time through other airlines as a ‘personal item’ I was charged an extra 100 bucks for it to be a carry on. I’ll never use your flights again, and I really hope others aren’t deceived by your prices either because when all is said and done I could have spent exactly the same amount on a delta flight!"

Frontier changed the gate at the airport with an hour to spare, we had to get out of the D terminal to the E terminal and they forced us to go through security again. This caused us to be late to the flight and they shut the door in our faces then the attendant laughed at us for being late. After talking to gate agents, the “help” desk at the airport, and the chat bot online they said there is no way we can possibly get a reimbursement and they cannot get us out on another flight today. There were several other people that went through the same thing we did. We have kids at home and are having to rebook with another airline just to make it home today. By far the worst airline we’ve ever taken and will never again book on Frontier. Our fault for trying to save money and get home early. "

They changed their baggage policy recently and I’ve experienced and witnessed this causing issues with customers. The people ate the gate seem to be annoyed at how many times this causes issues and refuse to offer any help at all. I recently had a staff member be incredibly rude to me and when I contacted customer support they didn’t apologize or offer to help. I was told I would need to personally “find the CEO” myself if I wanted any direct help. I am completely over this airline and will not be flying with them anymore. Absolute garbage company. I had to fly home for a funeral this week and still need to fly back on Frontier this week. I am thinking of just paying for a new flight to avoid having to fly with Frontier again.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to San Juan,December 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Extremely frustrating to have a flight changed to an inconvenient schedule by this company and not be able to modify or cancel your flights! Low costs should still maintain a minimum standard of inconvenience mitigation - it would have cost me $400 to cancel a flight - more than the ticket! And of course, you can't modify your itinerary and are told to ""call reservations"" where you are then told you can't speak to anyone but have to chat instead. So angry about this whole situation  I let them know I will fly with any other airline at all costs in the future. Their decision made my low-cost flight more expensive than with a regular airline seeing as it is cheaper to rebook than pay them to cancel and then book a new flight. Unreal."

It is always their incompetence. Never any other reason. They can't even make things right by compensation. They have just repeatedly blown me off. This is the last flight I have booked with them and once again we are waiting around past the delay time and with no answers as to when we will even take off.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Orange County,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They removed all customer service access and only allowed you to use an app and continually times out, giving you no actual time and when someone can talk to you, or they want you to use Twitter. So use a free platform because they can’t be bothered enough to provide you with. Even with flight insurance, I could not circumvent the fees to change my flight. It would be cheaper for me to get a new flight than it would for me to change the flight that I purchased. When I was flying to New York on Delta, I missed the flight. Delta told me it’s OK, you can hit the next one, which was in an hour with no hassle. I am trying to do this appropriately actively, and Frontier is giving me a fight. Through the app, when I tried to change the flight, the fee was $10, and I thought great, that’s more than reasonable. As I continued through the app, the fee increased 13 times more. Why? Why would you do that? I went through Expedia initially, so I circled back to Expedia; they explained the fees, even though you have insurance, still apply to you. I spoke with the representative through the chat because, as of November 2022, Frontier removed all phone customer service. They state they have affordable flights, but after buying the carry-on, the flight price would be the same if I went through any other carrier, so what’s the point? Terrible seats, and terrible service, I was on a three-hour flight, and they didn’t even offer us a beverage. They didn’t even offer us water. I will never fly this again. Sadly, it’s pathetic, and they should be ashamed of themselves."

There was a long line to enter to the plane to board and the lady who was in charge of checking us stopped us from letting us in at 0545 even if we were in line. She told us that plane will be close even if we were in lining up by the door to enter. She told us to rebook our flight for 14 hrs after which I end up purchasing from Alaska Airlines and fly an hour after. Generally the service was disgusting, I will not recommend frontier airlines for any body. On my flight from Chicago to las Vegas, I have to pay $215, no snack, not even a water. You will be charged for everything including for your carry on, and you will get the worst service in the earth."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,"Houston, Texas to Denver, Colorado",December 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I’ve always said I’ll never fly Frontier again after every flight but this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. On December 6th, 2022 I was on a night flight from Houston Texas to Denver Colorado, departing 21:05pm CST, arriving 10:43pm MST. After paying extra for extra leg room at the front I was subjected to what seemed like the brightest light on the flight. After the first 30 minutes to 45 minutes it was clear that the light was needed for flight attendant purposes which is understandable, majority of the time the light was left on. As a result I ended up wearing my hoodie backwards to shade my eyes from the light. Obviously there was no way I could duck down behind the seat but as a paying customer I shouldn’t have to. The picture below clearly shows the reason the light was kept on majority of the time was because a flight attendant was reading a book. Also attached to this review is a picture of what it could have looked like if the light was not on. We all know Frontier Airlines is terrible but it seems that regardless of how much you can pay for comfort Frontier will find a way to mess it up."

I submitted a form and got a response relatively quickly saying they would issue me a credit. Amazing! But then nothing. I got no follow up, no flight credit code, nothing on my account. I spoke to chat and they said they couldnt help me. I spoke to a manager on chat, she had me on the chat and was essentially telling me their systems were my problem, and then at some point just left the chat on me. No word or anything, just up and left. I waited for 30 minutes messaging every few minutes and got nothing. I have never had such a bad experience with any support team ever. period. At this point I feel I am being robbed, they promised a credit and now wont deliver on it. Stay away from this airline."

They felt the need to send my luggage in another plane which I don’t think should’ve been necessary because I had time to pay and make it through TSA. I landed in St. Louis and was told I need to ask the frontier airlines desk when to come in for my luggage and I was told, after the lady at the desk began ti act annoyed with me, “I don’t know. Probably around this time tomorrow,” even though she had a computer in front of her to tell me what time the next flight would be arriving at. I came back at the time she told me to and none of the frontier reps were there to help. I had to go tio the information desk to find out that they had another flight coming five hours after I had come in looking for my luggage and a flight left about an hour before I got there. There was poor communication and horrible attitude in the part of the frontier staff and I highly recommend you don’t fly with them."

My flight was changed from 1 day to another, I had to stay in Seattle and pay for a hotel. The same day of my flight that flight was delayed by an hour then my connection flight was delayed for 7 hours. After I had to wait 9 hours so that was more than 12 hours in the airport with no explanation. There was no way to talk to someone over the phone, only by a chat room and they will not do anything to compensate us. They just have the audacity to cancel and change flights without giving any explanation."

It got delayed and I received an email/text update. I hung out at my terminal until about an hour before my flight then headed to my gate. Noticed gate said different flight info than was expected. Employee working the desk told me the flight had been cancelled! No reasoning given or email sent. I told her I hadn't received any notice. All she said was announcements had been made but I know I didn't hear any. She directed me to go back to the check in desk to get rebooked. No flights were available until a couple days later for same location so while waiting in line I had to purchase another flight with a different airline to a different arrival location. Wasted 350$ and had to inconvenience someone to come pick me up at the new arrival location. Will NOT be flying Frontier again. Terrible communication and inconvenient rebooking process.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,December 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," This is the absolute worst airline known to exist. I waited over 3 hours for my delayed flight, waited in the plane for 45 min and then was told that there was no pilot available to fly the plane. I spent well over $200 for my ticket and they said that they can't refund me because they have no history for my seats. Also all the employees were all disrespectful and did not help me throughout any of this process. Also about 7 months ago this company made me wait for over 10 hours and they just kept delaying the flight every couple hours, as well as lying to my saying they will offer me free tickets and they never did this company should disappear and no one should ever ride this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Frontier is by far the WORST airline I have ever flown. When I say I will never ever, ever fly with them again I swear by it. My boyfriend and I had a connecting flight flight to Phoenix in which we had to make because of a tournament he was in. The flight was already delayed from the weather but by the fault of Frontier over booking multiple people in a few seats we were delayed further resulting in multiple people, including ourselves, miss that connecting flight to Phoenix. The flight attendants were rude and unprofessional and I heard her yell “I don’t get paid enough to do this” while trying to figure out the seating situation. The employee at their gate was also incredibly snarky. Like if you hate your life and job, just say so. Once we got off in Vegas, their so called “customer service” was unwilling to work with ANYONE to try and help their situation. Their next flight out wasn’t until Saturday NIGHT and we needed to be in Phoenix by Friday morning. They wouldn’t give any full refunds - only a measly partial refund of 80 dollars out of the 300 we spent, since we technically “already took the flight” to Vegas. So we said fine, book us back home to Denver on the next flight. AND THEY WOULDN’T EVEN DO THAT AT NO CHARGE. So I asked wait… I thought you guys said either partial refund or rebook and they said yes… ONLY a rebook to Phoenix because that’s your original destination. Oh my lord just a bunch of stupid people working for a stupid airline with zero empathy for customers. Do not ever take Frontier. You will never save that much anyway because they charge up the wall for luggage and they are all forcing people to pay $100 for even a personal item at the gate. Customer service doesn’t even exist for them, as you can see. A joke of an airline. Our only saving grace that trip was that we booked through Hopper and they were able to give us our refund."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Denver,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," This airline is plain and simple a scam. I first booked round trip flights for my boyfriend and I departing on different days. I needed to change either one of our departing flights to leave on the same day. I called their customer service number nearly 15 times within 2 days. They sent me the link to contact their online chat every time because they have no customer service representatives answering phone calls. Said online chat is a complete joke as I waited hours every time I attempted to contact them without anyone ever responding. On the way back, they lined up people and made them fit their personal bag in the sizer. My boyfriend’s bag, which he brought without issue on the departing flight, did not fit in. The lady in the front was extremely rude to us. She told us to step aside and that we wouldn’t be able to fly if we didn’t pay. When we moved to the other line as we were paying for the carry-on online, she yelled to the other agent in the counter to not let us in because we didn’t have a paid carry-on. The seats are literally bricks and they don’t have ports to charge electronic devices. You have to pay for every beverage. Crew is disgruntled."

They are draconian about carry-ons and personal items policies. Bag fees are very high Then, they make it a game by charging you more if they determine at the last minute, your bags don’t qualify as either personal items or carry-ons. On this flight, it wasn’t enough that my bag fit in the measuring bin, it had to fall end of its own weight. Seats are uncomfortable and small. No USB charging ports."

For the first flight I couldn't get my boarding pass and after speeding hours on two different devices, I was still the ""next in line"" for both and when I got a representative. I was told the reason I could check in was because I booked through expedia and their system was not updated. On the was back I experience the sma etching only when I received the booking I was unable to download and the rep kept telling me it's on the website however, I could not access it on the website because i was automatically sent to the check in page but it was also showing that I checked in. And at the airport I was to be charged an additional $25. When send did the self service to avoid this in the first place. And in order to get the pass sent to my email like they did on my way to Georgia I had also pay 25 dollars. If I do everything self service online, I should have access to my boarding pass online. Expedia is not an excuse and the website is not an excuse. Seat comfort is zero stars."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Salt Lake City,December 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Only fly Frontier if you want to get charged extra for every single detail of your travel. You even get charged $25 to speak to an agent at the ticket counter. My experience started there. This was very frustrating as I was trying to get my boarding pass on the piece of shit app they have. Didn’t work! Then you get charged for a seat assignment. Then you get charged for any carry one larger than a purse or small backpack.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Hartford,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Frontier Airlines is terrible. The customer service was terrible. The woman at the desk in Orlando was not just bad but downright mean. I watched her tell an 80 year old woman to figure out how to check in online or get in the hour line and pay. And she rolled her eyes at her. Also she told me the same. People were missing their flights due to bad customer service and just plain rudeness and not giving a care. I will literally never fly Frontier again. It’s like shopping at Walmart on Christmas Eve. Actually Walmart has friendly employees. The flight took off 40 minutes late due to seating discrepancies which should have been handled by the staff. It was just the absolute worst experience from start to finish. I fly 4 times a year and I have never been so ready to never fly again. If I do I will be going to Southwest on their site. I’ve never had an issue with Travelocity. You should consider dropping Frontier if they don’t correct their issues. I mean do they actually hire just plain bad humans? I’ve never seen anything like it.

What is a 4.5 hour drive on road took 4 hours on Frontier because the boarding, take off landing was delayed by 20 min. And even after landing we waited 25 min to get off the plane because some gate was not available. Even the baggage delivery takes a lot of time if you have checked-in the luggage.

I should have read reviews before I booked a flight with them! All negative reviews. The flight may be cheap, but when you add paying for a seat, one check in bag $49.00 a carry on $54.00 (which is way more than your regular airline and they only allow 40lbs not 50lbs) like regular airlines the flight winds up being much more! Don't take this airline, it is awful! My first and last time! I had to take my wife's beach bag cause I read a man took a small back pack, a personal idem and they charged him $100.00 at the gate! They are cons, my first and last trip with Frontier Airlines!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Seattle,November 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This flight from Orlando to Seattle with a 2.5 hour layover in Las Vegas ended up costing me more than my one way flight from Seattle to Orlando on Alaska. The seats are ridiculously uncomfortable, no padding and no recline option. The leg room is claustrophobic, and I am only 5'2! I chose this flight only because it had the time I was looking for to arrive back in Seattle. I had never flown Frontier before and was surprised (to say the least) that my boyfriend and I had to pay an additional $280 to choose our seats on the two flights, and carry on our 2 small suitcases. We had no idea until we went to check in online the night prior. I wouldn't recommend this airline, ever. Spend the extra to fly on Alaska, Delta, heck any other airline! Shame on Frontier for all the upcharges. If you still chose to fly this airline, bring your own water and snacks.  Don't say you weren't warned, just read all the reviews!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Tampa,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  So my boyfriends family and I flew out of Tampa Florida into Grad Rapids Michigan November 19th, 2022 - everything went smoothly other than a slight 20 minute delay. Saturday November 26th was our flight back from Grand Rapids to Tampa and at the absolute last minute they completely canceled our flight and offered no hotel accommodations and said there wasn’t going to be another flight until Monday, the 28th. They didn’t refund us for the checked bag we paid for OR the seat selection they made us pay for as well (which is ridiculous we just wanted to sit next to each other). So not only did we get stranded across the country we were told basically nothing about why our flight was canceled and why we were in no way accommodated. In the end you spend just as much money that you would’ve flying with a bigger airline - don’t bother with Frontier it’s absolutely awful."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Rochester,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I felt this airline is a big scam. Myself and my wife travelled by this airline, ticket price showed us $19 each and they made us to pay total $600 one way for both of us. It’s more expensive than any other airline with such low quality. Frontier staff were very rude and they don’t respect the customer. I met two people, one at bag drop counter and she was so rude and unresponsive, the same with the person at gate. They stopped us at gate for bag size. I travelled with same bag on many airlines but they said it was a little big and I needed to pay $99 for a small personal item. I would suggest anyone to not to choose this airline. If you choose you may suffer, mostly they will try to loot you in every possible way. We have many good airlines in the country and prices may show a little high but they are trustworthy and providing very good service to customers and respectful."

You think you are getting a good deal on ticket prices, but they nickel and dime you for everything. You have to pay for any bag you bring, even a carry-on. If you want to be confirmed to sit next to who you are traveling with, you have to pay for a seat. If you want to speak with a representative you need to pay for that. If you need help with your baggage, you have to pay for that. The seats on all of my flights did not recline. I will never ever fly this airline again. It cost so much money when it was all said and done and it was not worth the money!!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Denver,November 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  It’s saddening to see an airline able to get away with so much. It starts before you even board: instead of the industry standard bag weight limit of 50 pounds, you can only bring 40. Anything over that is $100 out of your pocket. Same goes for your backpack if it doesn’t fit in their tiny bag sizer. The seats feel like cardboard, are too short to rest your head on, and are so cramped that anybody above six feet is not going to reasonably fit in one without perfect posture. They were also 30 minutes late to depart with absolutely no warning or explanation, and when we landed we inexplicably sat on the tarmac for another half hour. Absolutely awful, don’t bother saving your money. I don’t know how the FAA allows this. They cut corners at every turn and we’re expected to bear the brunt of it as the customers. "

I went to Atlanta, my backpack was a bit fat, I rearranged my stuff and it fitted in the box perfectly, but their employee refused to look and made me pay 99$ for it.

Literally the worst experience possible, I would rather fly Spirit and that is saying something. The customer service will just piss you off and I have low standards. They lost my bags and was the only airline that didn’t not have agents available to ask where they lost it. Waited for hours and they were extremely rude. They will charge you for every single little thing. Forget anything they can consider “extra”. Oh and the flight isn’t even advertised as cheap and cutting corners like Spirit, that’s just how they are. You will get screwed if they change your flight or cancel it or forbid you miss your flight or need to change it for a medical reason."

Bags are extremely expensive. Dont ever use this airline unless you want to spend a fortune on bags just be talked down to & to ruin your vacation. Be warned, choose a different airline.

The Philadelphia staff is a group of utterly miserable people that are pretty aggressive and unsympathetic in making the entire boarding line measure their carry-on begs like they’re a bunch of children. They were pulling people out of line and charging $99 for a carry-on bag if the bag was an inch over the height limit. $99 for a carry-on? The flight was late with the plane still in Florida for over an hour without any update on the flight status. People were just standing around clueless to where it is. Left 90 minutes late for no reason communicated. Staff is miserable, customer service is atrocious, seats are solid rock, flights are perpetually late or cancelled, no Wi-Fi, “options” are standard on every other airline, and by the time you buy what you need, you’ve paid more for an experience that is an order of magnitude worse than any other airline experience. This was my final time getting sucked in by “discount” rates, only to fly on an airline that should be an example for every major company on how not to operate and treat customers. Worst airline on the planet."

We were talked to and treated like inmates upon arrival instead of like paying customers. All of the employees that were checking in bags had terrible attitudes and were very disrespectful. I did not witness one out of line customer only Frontier employees. We were also charged close to $600 for our luggage. Upon boarding was more extreme rudeness as they had everyone with backpacks try to fit them into the bag sleeve to see if they needed to add a carry on. Once we boarded it was obvious there was something wrong with the plane although they did not give us an update for thirty minutes. After an hour on the plane we were told to get off. We then waited another two hours before being told our flight canceled. Terrible experience and they do not deserve anyone's business.

We had to fly five people due to my mother having a stroke. So a completely unplanned trip. We paid for our bags prior to getting to the airport. We had no issues flying from Orlando to Dallas but trying to get home after purchasing nothing new to add to the weight of our bags. Also using the exact same backpacks I’m hit with an additional $200. On top of choosing my seat fees paying for my checked bags and of course my tickets. So in addition of our original ticket prices we ended up adding and adding almost $1000 in fees. In the future I’d never fly with Frontier. That’s not even taking in account the unfriendly service and lack of staff. Oh don’t pay for reclining seats they forgot have any. I flew first class.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Las Vegas to Denver,November 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I am in complete disbelief regarding customer service policies of Frontier. My wife and I arrived early to our gate, we listened as Frontier agents made continual announcements about how personal items or carry-on baggage needed to fit into a metal bag checker or be charged $99 when boarding the plane. For the agents, the process seemed to be a game similar to over-zealous security guards, who get drunk with a taste of power. When boarding, we were extra patient since I wanted to see the process unfold. These same agents ordered some passengers to place their bags into the slots. Several bags slid into the slots, yet were snug and told they still had to pay. Then, these customers were ordered to pay the $99. There were at least a dozen people who went through this ordeal. I am sure there were eventually many more. Once on the plane. I spoke with the people sitting next to me, who mentioned on an earlier flight that every single passenger were ordered to test their bags. We all know the Frontier game and many of us get lured in by the low fares and up-selling. However, it has become a bridge too far. Bag fees have increased from $30 to $40 each to $60 to $80. Seat fees have gone up from $10 to $20 to $30 to $40. With one bag plus a seat, a couple is now paying an extra $240 for up-selling fees beyond the ticket prices while having to endure a whole lot of attitude. After spending the day in Las Vegas, we were unable to check-in early. At the ticket counter, having a bit of service would cost us an extra $25 each. As a college business instructor, I became fascinated. If the purpose of business is to create satisfied customers, then Frontier is in trouble. Four other people around us said they would never fly Frontier again in addition to us. What about the approximately 25 people, who were humiliated and embarrassed by the Frontier treatment while boarding? Will they fly Frontier again? Probably not. Paying an extra $80 for a seat and a bag is a reasonable trade given the low fares on a round trip, yet paying an additional $180 extra with horrible treatment is crazy. We have decided to never fly Frontier again and gladly pay extra for peanuts, reasonable bag fees and employee smiles from other airlines. We will practice the discipline of rejecting the temptation of ultra low fares. Self respect is important and often has a price. Saving $50 or $100 is not worth the poor treatment. One mature lady said it best, ""They take the fun out of flying!"""

They were supposed to add my TSA number to my ticket so I could access preflight, they failed to do this and I could not contact them to fix it. They charge me for a carry-on bag because they said no carry-on of any sort was allowed. They failed to inform me of this prior to me booking the ticket. On my return flight from Atlanta to Phoenix I had to go to the ticketing counter to get my seat issued because it disappeared from my booking. Not only did they charge me $25 for the rebooking of my seat they charge me another $104 when they told me it was 79 for my bag. Sat for three hours at the gate they were supposed to leave at 8:59 PM. No plane no people no airline personnel. I looked online and seen that it was booked at another gate in another concourse. I went there and it was a different airline. Ended up going back down to the gate which took 45 minutes to get back there come back through check-in and security which took another 45 minutes. My new flight will leave at 12 PM. No email no text message no notification whatsoever. Did I mention that they have no phone customer service anymore? There a 24 hour Chat customer service disconnect you within three seconds of connecting, after 15 attempts I gave up. I go to the customer service counter and they say they have no more customer service or customer service phone numbers, how are you supposed to serve your customer? The worst airline experience in 40 years. I will never fly this airline again"

They charged every tiny thing and the final price is a huge number that you will never expect. They will not help you check in any more while all other airlines still provide that as free service. You need to check in by yourself. Otherwise pay for $25 for their agent service. Very strict on luggage size. Their plane was 1/3 filled only but they stilled charged me $100 for my school backpack when it could not fit in their measurement, more than the flight ticket itself and is equal to 2 checked bags. And i’m pretty sure if i tried to reorganize my backpack more (because it’s not that big) it could fit in well but they insisted my backpack is oversized. They want to make money anyway. Airlines and all of their employees, they are all the same. Just think, they charged 60 for a carry on bags and 55 for a checked bag while other airlines offer 30-40 for a checked bags, free for carry on and the flight tickets are just $10-20 more expensive. Frontier used to be an acceptable service but they have many new policies recently. All of their changes are just about making customers’ money. Nothing’s else. Money doesn’t go along with the service quality we should deserve. The service used to be average and now not acceptable. I do not think I’ll use this airline again."

I typically take a small backpack with me when I travel that easily fits under the seat when I sit down as my personal item. Today, I was one of 5-6 randomly selected passengers to get told I have to check my bag. This was not a consistent process and many guests didn’t even have to check their bags even though they were larger. It literally felt like they had to hit a certain quota of fees because they let most people board without checking the size of their bag. They then charged me $99 for my backpack. I never write complaints, but the lack of consistency and customer service has been ridiculous. Do not fly this airline!"

The ticket was purchased and confirmed on Sept 3rd. Then Frontier sent out another confirmation on Sept 22 and they had surreptitiously changed the return flight to DFW with no warning and no indication on the email that the original return flight had been changed. Instead of departing Vegas at around 11:24 AM (original time), they moved her to a 6:33AM departure time. It is impossible for my wheelchair bound sister to have gone at that time given that we live outside of the Las Vegas area. It took several hours to reach a human at Frontier (after passing through all the ""bot"" gate thresholds) only to be told that they had the right to change our flight without notification. Fortunately I am a frequent flyer on American and was able to purchase for her a one-way ticket on American with my miles. I will never fly Frontier airlines again. They may be low cost, but the other ""cost"" of inconvenience, missed flights, hotel stays, etc could have ended in unmitigated disaster. Fortunately, we caught their ""covert"" email in the nick of time. so my message to flyers: Buyer beware. You get what you pay for on Frontier and it is simply not worth it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Ft Lauderdale,November 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,  This is the worst airline ever. They have a 4 hour delay PHL to FLL. Minimal staff to answer questions. Telling customers they’re not entitled to a refund when the Frontier website/Legal Section specifically says refunds will be given if more than a 3 hour delay. Not an isolated incident. I had the same problem on a flight from FLL to PHL last week a 4 1/2 hour delay I’m retired military. The 3 times I flew into Afghanistan were easier than flying Frontier. Avoid this airline at all costs; take the train or the bus.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline ever. Save your money. Do not travel on Frontier! This was my first and last flight with them and I believe 90% of the people on this flight 1362 to FLL feel the same.  Flight was delayed twice for hours. Instead of making up for the inconvenience, they charged almost every single person $99 each for their personal bag, even a backup.  The manager called 911 on a lady because she came up with zone 1 and that wasn’t her zone and I guess she didn’t want to repeat herself. Horrible customer service. They made so much money off of us today because we didn’t want to be stuck in ATL. Never ever again"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Seattle,November 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We booked tickets to see our daughter in Seattle for her birthday as a surprise. Due to a conflict, we had to cancel them. Since most airlines allow you to cancel within 24 hours, I thought we would get a full refund. As it turns out, their policy is that if you are less than 7 days out, the ticket is non refundable. We were 6 days out. That in itself is BS. Then when trying to contact them to discuss the matter you ONLY have the option to chat with a BOT, and then with an agent. I did get through to an agent but she could only repeat their policy and would not let me connect with a manager. I have had a lot of issues with Frontier over the years but now I am done. This airline puts zero value on customer relations. Looking at all their terrible reviews on this website it's remarkable that they are still in business."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cancun,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  We had a group of 9 people going. to cancun for my 50th birthday. 2 weeks prior to date Frontier cancelled 2 of the 9 flights as they overbooked, my friends had to rebook with Southwest and pay a lot of money out of pocket. The day before the departure 5 of the remaining 7 were able to check in online and obtain boarding passes, 2 my daughter and her boyfriend said there were flight restrictions and to see attendant to check in. Day of flight we approached attendant and they refused to let my daughter fly stating her passport was not acceptable and wouldn’t even look at her boyfriends passport. When asked what could be done I was told to see what TSA said about the passport. We spoke to a Team leader for TSA whom said it was acceptable, when we told this to the attendant along with the TSA team leader the Frontier supervisor said it was his decision and he was not allowing them to fly. We then hurried down to Southwest airlines and had no issues getting a flight with them nor a problem getting through TSA, immigration at Cancun or getting on returning flight with Frontier in Cancun or customs at ohare on our return. The frontier flight to Cancun was completely full even though my daughter and her boyfriend were denied their flight. How is this possible unless they overbooked and used my daughters passport as an excuse or were discriminating against my daughter due to her being hispanic. When our travel agent contacted Frontier they said documentation was unacceptable then they said she was a no show. We lost over $600 due to this issue. Never use Frontier. In addition on our flight back my husbands and my seat were double assigned. What a mess. "

Chronologically, we first were charged for baggage that was, until recently, quite acceptable as carry-on. This alone wasn't an issue - The fact that their website wouldn't process the transaction was. Until it did. And the staff didn't accept it, instead insisting on charging a second, higher, fee, while simultaneously agreeing that we HAD paid. That was the start. Our first flight was late by two hours, which in and of itself wasn't much of a problem. Except the connecting flight was also two hours behind. Then four. Then canceled after a mechanical fault was found with the aircraft. The first thing the staff did, which clearly was important, was promptly inform us all that no recompense was, or would, be on offer. And that we were to deal with it ourselves. Right now, that leaves us, a group of four, and the remaining other passengers, stranded in the terminal after the employees promptly left. Save your money. Fly with anyone else, lest their problems be dumped on your head, and your family ends up stranded on the other side of the country, as mine is."

I genuinely think it took 10 years off my life. I arrived for a flight that was supposed to depart at 8 am. However when I got there to check my bags, nobody was there and there was a paper sign saying my flight has been delayed until 1:57 pm. So that’s 5 hours. But it’s not only the delay that made me upset. it’s the fact the app did not say a thing about it being delayed and when I finally did get notified, it was 7:50am. How does that make sense? Then it made me miss my connecting flight and there were no others that day so I can’t get home. They did refund me but not without being rude and completely unhelpful. Who knows if that will actually even go through."

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix ,November 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  If this review prevents even one hard working person from giving a disgraceful business like Frontier Airlines their money, I'll feel a bit better. My 4pm flight out of PHX has been delayed 5 hours to depart at 9pm. Frontier gives no reason for this delay or any compensation besides a small voucher to be used withinn 90 days. After spending hours on a customer service text chat (Frontier no longer has voice customer service?) the agent firmly stated that this is the maximum amount of compensation that can be offered besides canceling the flight all together and to take it or leave it. My wife and I now need to come up with an additional 5 hours of childcare cost as well as parking fees for our vehicle because Frontier found it convenient to push our flight back half a day. The airline clearly does not care about their customer's, only their own wallet. We normally do not fly this airline, but they had flights that fit our schedule very well for this trip. Unfortunately, as we've found out, they change times to whatever is convenient for them and all of our planning now means nothing. We could've flown a real airline if we'd known we'd be flying out so late. The sad part is that a company like Frontier airlines preys on customers with less resources and takes their money while providing truly unacceptable customer service with a ""Put up or, shut up! business model. When other airlines make mistakes, they at least try to take responsibility and better the situation. Frontier Airlines clearly does not care about its customers. Please please please do not continue to hand your hard earned money to such a poor excuse for a business. Let their disgusting morals and terrible business tactics run the business into the ground. Upper management should be ashamed and concerned but I won't hold my breath."

I click the link and it's just an automated message. I am unbelievably annoyed at this point. My flight is one hour from a sunny place to another sunny place.

During the boarding process of this flight and only this flight in my history with Frontier, the boarding attendant told me my bag was too big and commanded me to go and pay for a carry on. I don't like being confronted and told that I have to do something, especially when the boarding agent got in my face and violated my personal bubble. He was aggressive and when I fit the bag in box he still told me it wasn't good enough. So I asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't enough time to do so before the plane took off. So I had to pay 100 dollars additional for absolutely no reason other than a confrontational employee. I fit my bag under the seat no problem when I got aboard the plane. I even flipped the bag to the side and it fit in the container sideways."

Seats are uncomfortable. Now leaving Las Vegas back to Houston was the worst of the worst with Frontier Airlines, first they had long lines on every bag check in, even an outside one where the outside staff basically clocked out with people in the line and walked away making them go inside with the line getting longer, now we had a 6.05am flight, that’s was our boarding time, we were there an 1hr ahead but at 5.30am their system supposedly shut down and wasn’t letting them check anybody in so they forced us to switch our flight, didn’t get us a hotel room so we stayed at the airport until the next day just to run into more problems with baggage drop. First off the computer cut off and started messing up again and we then got told two different things on bags, where we had to pay for a check bag and our personal item which were normal size backpacks but said they were carry on but back in Houston got told differently. This is the worst airline I have flown and I would not recommend it to anyone! "

The flight was delayed more than one hour because of some mechanic problem, which doesn’t make me happy, who wants to fly on a plane with mechanical problems. Also, you check the dimensions of you personal item and it meets the measurements, when you arrive to the gate they asked you to fit the bag in square, and mine did not fit, so I had to pay $100.

I swapped my ticket to go from DFW to DEN then DEN to PHX. However, I asked for a hotel voucher to go rest since I have nowhere to go and my flight is now nine hours away. I have a spinal issue where I am in extreme pain constantly and would like to lie down and feel better. Still over 4 hours have passed and have not received one. Spoke with the front desk agents that were very nice. However, their superior has been ignoring their messages and calls. I’m sitting here writing the review right now as I am still waiting for something which will be completely worthless at this point. I am so unbelievably frustrated with how the superiors behave towards their customers by completely ignoring them when there are cancellations. It seems they don’t care one bit about the people that fly with them. If I could have gotten another ticket with a refund I would have. However, I bought the ticket over a month ago for a cheap price and now the flights were 5-10 times the price I originally paid. It shouldn’t be my problem to solve when they have issues and if they can’t accommodate things quickly or efficiently I shouldn’t be made to suffer. I understand this happens sometimes but there should be some better protocols than we will refund you the small amount you paid or change your flight for you and you’re on your own for anything after that point. It’s just ridiculous to be going through this especially when someone is suffering from a medical condition and can’t do anything but wait in the airport or pay for my own hotel room."

I booked a flight that THEY rebooked me from and told me that I can either accept the new booking or cancel for travel credit. I cancelled it for travel credit but they rebooked me on the other flight anyway, which was not the option that I chose Then I cancelled it, took the cancellation fee ($120) hit so that I could book a different flight path with the credit. When I put in the travel credit through their checkout for the new flight, they also asked for my credit card information, which I understood, a lot of companies do just in case the credit is not enough or it is expired or something, but they changed the full amount to my credit card instead! After I saw the charge on my credit card, I tried to use their chat feature on their site and told them I was charged to my credit card instead of the travel credit, and they said that they cannot make a change to a paid reservation even though the error was on their side. I also trying to contact Chase because that was the card I used to fill a change back but Chase said that I have to talk to the merchant. So I am out the original amount that I paid for the first flight that was changed and this flight. It is so bad and the review are so terrible on here that I don't even want to fly with them and booked another flight with Alaska just so I would not have to start my trip off with such a terrible experience."

My Credit Card was charged twice while purchasing tickets and it was impossible to get assistance from the airline. Because their support staff is apparently severely understaffed. I tried calling support the minute they opened in morning (multiple days) only to hear ""please call back the lines are busy. When I finally was able to get a position over the phone (meaning...not disconnected because they were to busy), the call timed out after 1 hour. I contacted online support...only to find out that if you don't keep an eye on the chat, when the rep finally does respond (for me took about 45 min) if you are not looking at your browser and don't respond inside of a few minutes, they will say ""you must no longer be there"" and the support session is disconnected. So it is important to keep an eye on the browser window (which has no notification bell on the chat, come on, get a web dev to fix that). One would think, Frontier is doing everything they can NOT to assist their customers."

I was given the option to choose this new flight itinerary at no extra cost or cancel for a full refund. I chose to cancel. I received an email saying my refund was being processed, and then 20 minutes later received an email confirming my booking (for the redeye). I tried calling, but the number on their website would not connect. I spent two hours on chat, and found that my reservation was indeed still standing. Finally got it actually cancelled. It felt super scammy and like they were hoping I'd just give up and accept the new flight with the terrible hours that didn't even arrive on the day I needed to arrive. I'll never book with them again. I'd rather pay extra to fly with one of the other airlines I've never had trouble with before."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Baltimore,October 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was the worst flight I have taken! I had heard terrible things about Frontier, but I did my research ahead of the flight. I purchased a carry-on that was in compliance with the bag dimensions provided on the Frontier website. The sole purpose of doing so was to avoid carry-on fees. Well, that failed. When arriving to the gate, the gate staff was extremely unprofessional. One of the ladies was arguing with customers while the other was just flat out rude, telling almost half of us that we would have to pay a $99 carry-on fee. Although my bag was within the dimensions, I was charged that fee. I did not argue because I saw how other customers were being treated. Of course when I was on the plane, my bag fit comfortably under the seat in front of me, but this is no surprise. I will never fly with Frontier again. I do not care if the flight is free!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,November 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Their carry-on bag policy is a joke. It's all about charging a person $99 per bag when you get their gate. Their policy has your bag so small that if it's anything more than laptop bag or a purse you'll be paying extra. Their gate customer service reps are rude and aggressive. It's like they get paid a commission to charge you the extra fees. Our flight was delayed solely because they were collecting fees from passengers.  Fortunately, I wasn't carrying a very big bag but the rude agent asked if I had any personal items in my medical bag (which is exempt from being counted as a bag), that she was going to charge me if I did. She didn't inspect the bag, I assume, because we were 30 minutes past the departure time. I dislike Frontier now. I used to love them and their prices. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Orange County,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline experience ever. I did not actually think it could be this bad. I believe this company hates their customers, and that is not an exaggeration. The ticketing agent had a bad attitude and was unhelpful, the boarding agents were making everyone weigh their bag causing frustration and delays, and lastly we have had an impossible experience dealing with customer support to use a travel credit. It takes 2ish hours to get a hold of someone by phone or chat and even if you do get someone there is no guarantee they will not just hang up on you or refuse to help. It seems like agents are micromanaged such that they are not even able to help you if they wanted to (and them wanting to is a 180 degree stretch) because they have no authority to. It is clear that the company culture encourages anti-customer sentiment from the top down. 0/10 in every category. They are not even cheap once you add all the hidden fees. I will never fly this airline again and will actively warn others not to."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Hartford,November 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Worst airline I've ever had the misfortune of using. Just for context, we are a travel nurse couple and fly a minimum of once every 3 months. When boarding, they had two staff members at the gate making everyone check the size of their personal items. If you had to ""force"" the item into the sizer (aka it didn't slid in on its own with no friction) it didn't count as fitting. Is your bag kinda poofy but with a little push can be almost flat? Doesn't matter. You forced it, it doesn't fit. Go pay $99 to use the overhead bin. Add on to this, the actual space under the seat in front of you is LARGER than the sizer they use at the gate. My girlfriends bag easily fit under the seat, with room for her feet, but she still had to pay $99 for it. The flight took so long to board, due to everyone having to pay more for their backpacks, that we were 45 min late to get into the air. Which, the flight getting to us was delayed by an hour as well, since it was clear skies at our destination and at the airport, I can only assume it was late because of the same reason. On the plane, the seats are basically rocks with a fake leather covering thinly stretched over them. The seats have no headrest to speak of. Zero lumbar support. And not even God can help you if you are taller than 5 foot 3 inches, because you will be sitting with your knees inside your chest. The staff are rude and ruthless. This is not an airline, it is a scam. We will pay more to be with other airlines from now on, we will rent a car and drive 36 hours to our destination, we will cancel vacations or contracts, rather than ever fly with Frontier again. Avoid at all cost. You have been warned."

They charged an extra 100 for a single bag that weighed less than 40 pounds, then charge over 100 to cancel a flight after 24 hours. I'd pay half price at the most. They charge so much for no reason. They also served half of the plane and then never returned to the second part even though there was no turbulence? So I never got water. Their service is just terrible all around and they are so disorganized. Honestly worse than Spirit."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,November 2022,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  My trip was cancelled due to weather, which is understandable. However it seemed every website knew my flight was cancelled expect for the website for the actual airline I was flying with. Google and the departing airport showed the flight as cancelled before 4:30pm CST, Frontier didn't show the flight as cancelled until after 9pm CST. In fact, at 6pm - two hours after the flight had been cancelled, Frontier asked me to pay for a carry on. I'm not upset that my flight was cancelled, at all. I'm upset that Frontier had the clear opportunity to notify customers in a timely manner and chose not to. Frankly, it feels like Frontier was hoping I would cancel before they did so they could avoid refunding me."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Trenton to Atlanta,November 2022,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst experience ever.  I had a very small bag (the only item) which can be considered a personal item. Got to the gate, which two employees are stationed to watch and stop each person with items that appear to be oversized as a personal or carryon at the door. The employees direct any to use the carryon or personal item measuring to indicate if any are oversized. If your items are oversized, you’re charged $99 to bring the items on the plane as a carryon. This is a straight rip off and sudden needs to be done about this. Frontier used to be the GO TO airline, but now has become the Run From airline. Everything has become a charge for this and that. Quality airlines let you have a personal item free of charge and make free changes. Don’t waste your money here."

They are not in the transportation of passenger business. It was sickening how they nickel and dime the passengers and how they emphasize charging for bags. This poor lady was being charged $99 for her bag which would fit except it had a hard bottom and couldn’t squish the .25 inch. She was so confused and disappointed. Felt for her. They also wanted to charge me $25 for one of the lazy attendants to actually work and print a boarding pass. I had to show him that I can’t check in on the app because it was showing that I can’t connect to their server. Not if I can help it again would I use this airline.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Islip to Orlando,May 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  When we showed up at the airport, the line was wrapped around the corner and the airport was understaffed and slow paced. By the time we got up to the front the woman would not let us on our flight. Even though we were there early. I was very disappointed. We then waited on a line for customer service for about 25-30 minutes to be told that the next flight we could get on was 9:50 P.M. the next day. They were also not confident in the fact that they could request a refund for us. She also kept rolling her eyes at us. I asked to speak to a manager and the woman was very disrespectful and refused to bring one for us to speak to. This is extremely unprofessional. The next day, when we showed up for the 9:50 P.M. flight we were told that we were not on the flight. They had to adjust this and get us back on the flight. All we were offered at the time was a credit toward another flight at your airline. We should have been offered a refund back on our original form of payment."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Las Vegas,October 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier takes ""budget airline"" to a whole other LOW point. Horribly uncomfortable seats that have zero cushioning (except for premium seating that you will pay $80 for on top of your flight, bag, airport fees, etc. After being nickled and dimed for every little thing (an advertised $89 flight ended up costing $357 total because you have to pay for everything. I didn't even check a bag, just had my purse and a small carry-on) and then when you fly they try to enroll you in their ""program"" as well as their credit card offer. (listen carefully to the fine print as the flight stewards tell you all about it while you wait to de-plane). It's nauseating and very clearly set-up for them to win, not you. There are no in-flight comforts, none whatsoever, and it's really quite uncomfortable (I'm a small-ish woman). But the real horror was when my return flight was delayed, then we finally boarded only to sit on the plane for 2 hours while they tried to remedy a technical issue. We were finally permitted to de-plane and were told to hurry to another terminal to catch a new plane which didn't actually arrive at the gate for another 2 hours...and we couldn't board it because of technical issues. In total we waited in the airport/plane for a total of 10 hours before they announced the flight was just plain cancelled. Then we're told that if you want to be re-booked OR refunded (and not have to pay extra fees) you have to march down to the ticket counter at the main terminal and wait in line with the 250 other people you're supposed to be flying with and wait for their 4 attendants they have on duty to reschedule or refund you. (please don't expect a full refund, not happening!). By the time I got to an attendant I was told that they couldn't rebook me (and my two minor children) home for 5 days.  Because they only had one seat available on this flight and one seat available on that flight. The people next to me in line (a couple) were being separated to fly home and sent all over the country to puzzle-piece their return flights. I was straight up told that unless I was willing to send my minor children on their own flights home, ""m'am, I can only refund you, I can't get you and your children home unless you want to wait 5 days."" Obviously I could not extend our vacation for 5 more days so I took a measly little partial refund and then had to go through the effort of finding us a flight home on another airline because that is not a service Frontier provides. They have no partner airlines or ability to help you book with someone else. You're on your own. I heard some awful stories from other weary Frontier travelers. People who keep being lured in by ""cheap"" prices, only to miss weddings, birthdays, reunions, funerals, dying relatives, etc. It's horrible, Don't ever fly with Frontier, Just don't. It's not worth whatever low price they try to get your attention with. Not by a long shot. P.S. We flew home the next day with Southwest. They were amazing. My new favorite airline."

It was cheap but that’s not why we flew. It was one of the few direct flights! Moving forward, they have zero customer service. Try and call, 2 hr wait time and no call back. Go to the airport early with a concern, forget about it, they are too busy to deal with you unless your concern is boarding that flight. It’s the only airline I fly that doesn’t apply my global entry number, my TWIC number or my TSA number. It’s a mystery to me! "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,November 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I went from GRR to DEN with a connecting flight to SFO. We got off the plane at gate A44 which was the exact gate we were boarding the connecting flight from. From GRR to DEN our personal items passed inspection, even put them in the holder to make sure and an employee approved. When boarding our connecting flight (same exact plane, same seats) the boarding process was chaotic, aggressive and urgent. The employees were making every person measure their bags. They were hastily announcing that they were shutting the doors with no exceptions and making that announcement several times in a short period. The employees still had people lined up as they stiff armed them about bags and the kicker is when bags weren’t fitting they would deny entry and made them buy carry ons, while threatening to close the doors. Some of these bags would fit but the backpack straps would be hanging over the edge and they were still forced to pay, come on! As I was in line waiting (and panicking) there was a place to buy bags online, I desperately tried that and of course the link didn’t work. First my bag passed, then my husbands didn’t, we moved to the side to figure out what to do and I get forced to measure my bag again and it didn’t pass. Ultimately my husbands bag didn’t pass and we purchased a carry on. This is where I lost my wallet (my fault but the circumstances didn’t not help). The employees were just mean and many people were left embarrassed, I saw two women crying. In conclusion, I’d rather spend my money on a flight that doesn’t leave me and fellow passengers embarrassed."

They now want me to fly to Denver with an overnight layover and fly to Fort Myers the next day. Seriously? The only option they provided was a refund or a similar flight the next day. I now have to book a new flight through another airline and pay 3 times as much because of the late notice they provided. This is ridiculous."

Then in the middle of boarding your employee took it upon herself to close the door to the aircraft and stop the boarding while screaming at all the passengers that there wont be anyone boarding until everyone is sitting down. She almost caused a riot with the crowd. First off you don't talk to a crowd of over 100 people like they are children, 2nd there was no where to sit down due to the crowded airport! This was very disturbing behavior to many many passengers as well as myself and should be addressed in a serious manor. Personally myself I will never fly Frontier airlines again after what i experienced today simply due to the fact your employees at the Las Vegas location made me feel unsafe and even potentially threatened."

The soonest they could rebook me was the Tuesday redeye that landed on Wednesday morning. Waiting 2 1/2 days was unacceptable. They only offered to cover 1 night of hotel so that made it even more ridiculous. I tried to call their customer support line and the recording said it would be 1 to 2 hours before anyone could help me. Their online customer support chat feature had a couple auto responses for me.

I got a sorry excuse for an apology on Twitter, so I'm going to do all the reviews I can so others don't have to go through what we went through.  Getting a flight back home took over 2 hours to work out the details. We received our cancelation notice on a Sunday. So we had to do it over chat since they have no one to answer calls 24/7 and offer assistance. We had to keep our rental car an extra day, which cost us money.  We had to pay to get a hotel at between flights because of how we were able to arrange flights home. This cost US money. We had to pay for a cab to get us to our hotel because we arrived so late there wasn't a shuttle available. Cab driver took cash only and we have no receipt. So that was an unexpected travel cost. I had to pay for a bag in Denver that I purchased because of its exact dimensions, but for some reason it was too big in Denver. So that cost $$ 6.We had to pay for two extra days of parking at our home airport. and that was an expensive parking payment. With all of these expenses plus food for my family and I, we spent close to $400 just to get back home. Also, all of their flights get delayed because of how they hassle people about their bags at the the gate. All of our flights left and arrived late. This airline is worse than terrible. "

Astonishingly bad customer service and rude for absolutely no reason at all, these employees are poorly trained. The manager in the end didn't let about 10 passengers board on our flight for absolutely no reason, just because she feels powerful in her role. I was already past the hallway, just waiting for my partner and the employee kicked me back out to the gate exit. Some others were trying to pay for their oversized personal items and were denied to do so. Another passenger was refused to board the plane, even when his family of 4 were already on it, his family had to get off the plane because of course they weren't going to fly without the complete party. We all missed our flight and she didn't offer a reason as to why, I asked the other crew members what her name was, they stated she was the manager and that her name was confidential. In the end we lost not only our money, but our time as well. We had to book another same day flight via United Airlines. I've been trying to get my money back for the Frontier flight, but customer service 1800 says that their system shows that I did board the flight. Which also raises a myriad of questions about liability, security, customer service, and reliability of all the computerized tracking. Shouldn't it be important to know who's on the plane? What an unforgettable experience. I will ensure I do not travel with Frontier again. I should be entitled to compensation and the airline should take disciplinary action against flight attendants that are too heavy-handed. The law prohibits air carriers from denying a passenger traveling on a confirmed reservation permission to board, or involuntarily removing that passenger from the aircraft, once a passenger has checked in for the flight and had his/her ticket scanned."

Our luggage could be available for pick up at carousel four. We went to the ticket gate to get information about booking another flight for Monday the 24th of October. Customer service was very rude had no answers after two hours. We laughed and had to get a hotel room at that point we booked our flight online. I have been trying to get somebody from frontier on the phone since October 22 I have yet been able to talk to anybody nobody will answer the phone. I have sent an email trying to find out about a refund. I sent documentation receipts again this was no fault of mine that it was canceled. It was a fuel leak and their customer service and the way they treat their customers is unacceptable. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Denver,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  St. Louis to Denver. Frontier cancelled this flight at the last minute. Then as passengers got in line for Frontier to help with the process of finding another way home, we were told there were no more Frontier flights and we were on our own. The Frontier employee said don't stand in line because we will not help you. We were forced to book another flight on our own on Delta at a significantly higher price of $1048.60. We were offered absolutely no help at all at the airport. Since no assistance was given by Frontier, we asked for a refund of the difference between the price of the Frontier flight ($139.98) and the cost of the Delta flight ($1048.60). After numerous calls to customer service the request was denied and we were offered nothing."

Flight with a stop, delayed for 3 hours and then got cancelled. We got a rebook with the same Frontier airlines to fly next morning via layover stop, so we had to stay in the airport overnight. The next day, once we reached the intermediate stop/layover(CLE), we were supposed to travel to our final destination(Atlanta) in the evening. Again delayed for 5 hours and then cancelled after we boarded the flight, just before 5 mins to the door close. The reason Frontier Airlines staff told us is, one of the crew members couldn't show up on time. The staff were rude, no concern for customers.  Finally, We travelled with a different airline, to reach out destination"

She rolled her eyes every time someone asked her anything , and was being very rude while checking bags to make sure they would fit under the seats. She was doing her job but in a very rude manner.  The attendant could have been nicer to my autistic son when telling him he needed to buckle. He didn't even know what what going on. My family and I will never take this airline again."

Our biggest mistake: we entrusted Frontier to safely get us home. After constant 30 min delays due to “cleanup/maintenance” we become aware our flight has been cancelled. Not via the overhead speaker but from various emails that are received by passengers. This is due to not being able to find a pilot despite constantly reassuring us that everything is fine. So we trusted Frontier and waited patiently, although that all changed when they canceled the flight. It became a mad rush of booking new tickets which increased the demand exponentially and forced us to buy new tickets at more than double our original price (also being red eyes). To make matters worse, their customer service was awful. All Frontier did was refund the ticket and wish us good luck. I will never fly Frontier again and I recommend the same to anyone else"

It was night flight. The agent on gate was extremely rude and unprofessional. I asked her to give me the tag for the stroller (I was in long line online before) and she said “go to other agent. She will give it to you”. Then I asked “why did not you tell me that before? I spent long time online”. She answered “why did not you asked before?” I was so surprised. I had to start other line from the beginning. Ok. Other agent acted like I was not there at all. She ignored me, than she gave me a tag for stroller, I wanted to go to my plane, but the previous agent did not allowed me to do that and said that I have to scan my onboarding passes one more time, but she did it before. I asked why is needed again? She said “ you have to do that again. You are so annoying” . How is possible to talk like that?!! Ok, I asked her to provide me her last name and she hide her employee ID than.  She said to her co-worker “I’m so done with her. Close the gate. She will not fly”. I made a picture of her then, cause she did not show her name. She did for me and my 2 years old baby a hard time, we spent full night at the airport. When I asked her where is the next flight, she said at 5 pm which is not true. I saw that the next flight was at 5.30 am with one stop on Cleveland OH. When I said it to her, she said “do we have tickets?” I said that I can show it to her. After that they will give me those tickets. In Cleveland was very “friendly” agent as well. She said “I wish it will be never ever again any flights to Philadelphia” to her co-workers. So I said then “Frontier never ever again. This is the last time”. She answered “I am not talking with you. Do you wanna fly next week?” Please tell me how is possible to talk like that for staff?!  The worst staff, attitude and airline I have ever seen in my life."

Very mean customer service and rude people at the gate and you won’t be able to get anyone on the phone.

This is all happening while they’re talking to me condescendingly and being very rude. WORST experience I’ve had with an airline and that’s saying a lot!

Get to airport, delayed for another two hours, then another two hours. Ended up not getting to Vegas until almost six in the morning when we were originally supposed to be there before midnight. 3 in the morning and they are still measuring peoples carry on bags and up charging anyone whos bag was even slightly too big. Was traveling in a large group and was charged over $1000 for hotel rooms we didn't really need since we didn't get into town the day we were supposed to. On top of this we were only there for 3 days and the first day was pretty much wasted due to catching up on sleep. Frontier customer service was rude and refused to offer any kind of apology, travel voucher, nothing. Will gladly pay more for a ticket on any other airline from this point forward. To add insult to injury they have the most uncomfortable seats that I've ever experienced. Would give zero stars if it was an option"

Today I tried to tag my prepaid bag, waited in line, machine said ""out of paper. See attendant"". I waited again and their employee a) virtually yelled at me that ""this always happens. And then b) walked off saying ""pick another line."" I tried to explain I'd been through two lines already with the same result. She stormed over slammed a sign on the machine out of order and walked away. I stood in line again tried another only to be told I may not check bag more than 2 hrs before flight. Family needed to drop me early so here I sit with no food, coffee etc because I can't go through tsa yet. In an hour I get to start all over. This is why I don't fly these guys anymore. You have to work to get such nasty temperaments in employees also. As I left one of them was berating a woman over the cost of an overweight bag--now max is 40 lbs. 41 lbs? It's $100 total for your bag. It's too bad. I used to fly them a lot. This is my last flight with them though. The problem isn't the planes etc it's the check in process and those employees. It's really too bad."

At 2pm, they said a latch needed to be repaired & would take 30 mins. At 3:30pm they said it would be another 45mins. Flight was then pushed to 5pm, then 7pm then canceled. We waited in line until 9pm to ask for help with this situation. Frontier said we could have a flight the next day then changed it to a 4 day delay. The only option we were left with was a $563 Delta flight next day. I have a sick child at back in ATL who was only left with one extra day of medication in family care. Frontier offered a refund which would be fraudulent for them not to for a service that was not provided, but in no way compensated for the 5hr delay & cancelation. By law, passengers are the airlines responsibilities. They left all passengers high & dry. Staff lacked compassion & had terrible attitude.  This ordeal left many families with emotional distress and cost an unexpected $600 + out of pocket. I have never been do disgusted by a company before."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Ontario,October 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  I booked two one-way tickets from Dallas to Ontario with a layover in Denver. We arrived 2 hours in advance to anticipate delays with TSA. We proceeded to make our way to our gate. We boarded our flight at approximately 1700 even though our flight was scheduled to leave at 1643. Once on board we ended up setting in the aircraft for more than 3 hours due to some maintenance issues they were having. We were told repeatedly that it shouldn’t be much longer and that paperwork was needing to be completed before we leave. This was terribly handled. Frontier should’ve been able to cancel the flight at about an hour into our wait time so that the passengers would’ve been able to find another flight to get to their destination. Instead we waited more than 3 hours on a plane that never moved and ended up having to stay in a hotel overnight because there were no more flights. The worst experience with flying I have ever had. I’ll never fly with Frontier. I have no idea how Frontier is still in business. Extremely disappointed.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,October 2022,,,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  The flight was cancelled by Frontier Airlines due to ""flight has been disrupted."" Yes I received a refund but not in full. I was told that there is a $59.99 membership fee that is non-refundable. So I called the airline customer service and waited at least 20 minutes before I was answered. I explained to the customer service representative that I was not expecting a membership fee for $59.99 as other airlines charge nothing to enroll in the mileage program and that you will sometimes even get miles credit for enrolling. Additionally, since the flight has been cancelled few hours before departure and i had to find a last minute flight, then I was hoping for a full consideration in good faith by the Frontier Airlines. I don't have any use for this membership since I am not flying with Frontier Airline due to this flight cancellation. Specially when I learned that there are additional charges to get a seat assignment, check in and carry on bag charges, as well as membership fee. Then the customer service representative's only reply was...I'm sorry but the membership fee is non-refundable. I spoke to the supervisor asking for reconsideration but was told the same thing. "

Want to have an assigned seat? Pay. Want to check a bag? Pay. Want to enjoy a cup of soda, pay. Don't be deceived when you see that their initial pricing is ""cheap"" - you end up paying hundreds more in add-ons. If your checked bag is over 40lbs you will be charged $100 more each direction.

Now, I've waited for hours on both phone and online chats to talk with representatives who have said nothing other than ""we can only enforce the policy.""

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Buffalo,October 2022,2.0,4.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2," Absolutely the worst airline I have ever flown. 5 hr delay due to mechanical issues in Philadelphia. The flight had been delayed in Philly since 1.30 pm. We were not notified until boarding time 5.00pm. Didn't leave until 10.45pm. People could have come to airport later and not sat for 6-7 hrs. That was not the main issue. Ground staff were unprofessional, down right nasty. (No I didn't complain and I'm not a Karen). I was told one employees life story about her kids etc. while waiting in line, and she should have been at the counter, ok she was friendly. Meanwhile her boss was yelling at customers, and down right rude. People were tired and cranky and sure they were as well, but...staff were swearing, when asked by other customers what happens if flight cancels the customers were told in a snotty way 'what would you like us to do? We cant make a plane appear', not alternatives were offered, no assistance. They were told if they wanted to rebook next flight was Wednesday and fees would apply. It was Monday. Plane was not cleaned once it finally appeared. Then this staff member was making sure that personal bags fit in their item size box, even after a 5 hr delay they sure made sure those customers paid the $79 fee for it as a carry on. Even after the delay. Staff were not pleasant or accommodating to anyone. Oh and they do an inflight ad about their credit card and even being applications down the plane. They were more worried about getting extra money than their customers. I have travelled on many airlines, including other low rate and full service airlines and never  have I seen customers be so disrespected by staff. Its a shame their planes are very nice although seating is tight. Pricing is great until u pay for all the extras which are more expensive than other airlines."

And on the way home from Cancun they pulled me aside with the same shoulder bag I carried on the trip down. Told me I had to pay $99. So total baggage cost for 2 people on this trip, $500. The tickets were not cheaper than other more favorable airlines, so I don’t understand why they insist they are a budget airline.

My bag was actually smaller coming home, it fit into the personal item holder and the woman working the front desk kept telling me it was too big. This wasn't an issue coming down and I'm not overpaying the $99 for 1 bag. That is the whole reason people fly frontier is for it being affordable.  Everyone didn't have an issue coming to Florida but all of a sudden every bag is too large. The staff is ignorant and very controversial. I will never fly Frontier again. "

I always make the mistake of thinking “maybe they’ll be better this time” and they never are. They delay my flight almost every time and that’s if I get lucky and they don’t cancel it. This time they cancelled my flight and moved me to one that gets in at 4:30 am the next day. When I called last week they said I should be able to change it for free because it’s their fault. That’s the first and last decent customer service person I’ve ever spoken to there. At this moment I have been trying to get ahold of customer service for 4 hours.  I have been hung up on 5 times now. When I finally made it through to someone we either got disconnected or he hung up on me. That was 2 hours ago. They scam you out of your money by messing up on their end and refusing to refund. They began charging $99 at the gate for your personal item even if it fits in the box and you’ve travelled with that same bag under your seat 10 times now. What’s even the point of having a customer service team if they aren’t going to do anything. Sometimes I wonder if they’re just sitting around laughing while the phones ring because even if they do answer they don’t do anything. They’re rude, unreliable, and have absolutely no care for how awful they are. Instead of making improvements in the company to make more money, they scam their travelers out of their money and time.

After purchasing my tickets online, i noticed my carry-on was now recorded as a checked bag. i tried rectifying this with the airline via phone and their website but to no avail. I again tried correcting the problem at the ticket counter in the airport and the incredibly rude lady told me i needed to do it online, which i tried again, but you can’t. When i brought this up at the gate to the same rude lady from the ticket counter she stated that Frontier just audited them and they’re to give no leniency when it comes to bags. i was forced to pay the $79 (even though i already paid the $64 online with my original purchase) to carry my bag on. another gate attendant who was slightly more helpful did say that they would put a note on my account so i could be refunded. while on the flight, the lady in front of me had a cat and instead of stowing it underneath the seat in front of her, she had it sitting on the seat in front of me. the cat urinated which ended up soaking my backpack that was stored under the seat. Being that our flight was delayed two hours, we arrived in Vegas at 3am and no one was available at gate check to assist with my cat pee covered bag (which was contained in a garbage bag now). I ended up having to throw the backpack away because the hotel doesn’t dry clean back packs. The flight attendant was as accommodating as she could be and said that if i file a claim, frontier will replace my bag. she also said she would not it under my account and that the airline will know what happened because they will have to schedule a special cleaning for that area of the plane. I made multiple attempts to reach frontier while on vacation (auto recording that the hold time was more than 30 minutes so couldn’t connect me), and when I did talk to a person, they put me on hold for 47 minutes then said they couldn’t find my booking, put me on hold but i could still hear them, and they intentionally hung up on me. Again, got to the airport and had to pay another $79 to carry on my bag, but again they noted it on my account. After spending 2 hours trying to sort things out with them when i got home (they repeatedly told me they didn’t have record i was on the flight and acted like the couldn’t see the notes that were entered on my account) they kept arguing with me saying they would only refund me the original $119 that I paid online because its more to add a carry on at the gate. After finally getting them to agree to refund me the $158 that i shouldn’t have had to pay in the first place, i check my bank statement only to find that they lied and only refunded me the $119. i haven’t been able to get a hold of them since. I filed a claim in regard to my bag and it’s been 10 days and i still haven’t heard anything. This is a joke of an airline that has zero value for customer service."

We all had a backpack for a personal item when we got on the plane. My young daughter's (6 and 9 years old) have rolling backpacks so they don't have to carry them on their backs. When we flew out of Denver there wasn't any issues. When we were heading back to Denver from Vegas, we were waiting in line and a customer informed us that the E-Tickets provided by Frontier on the phone isn't working for TSA and they need paper tickets. When we got to the counter to drop or bags I informed the employee of this information. The employee advised it will cost $25 to have tickets printed. We didn't pay, waited in line to be told that or E-Tickets don't work and we need paper. I went and explained this and the employees were very rude, didn't want to print the tickets and advised they will only print my ticket. Once I was able to get through this issue, we are walking to board the plane and the lady stops us and tells us or daughters rolling backpacks are to big. Their backpacks were the same size as the backpacks my wife and I had on our backs. They advised they have to fit in the size box or it will cost an additional $100 dollars. We have traveled several times with the same rolling backpacks that fit under the seat and it has never been an issue. Every staff member I spoke to was rude and disrespectful. I don't think I can ever stomach flying Frontier ever again! It is a cheaper flight, but is it worth the rude employee's, being disrespected, being talked down to and the upcharge for a backpack if they choose to do so?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Las Vegas,October 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I am livid. I brought a backpack to put under my seat (like I have done on many flights with Frontier before this). The gate agent looked at every single person’s bag and stopped people from boarding if he believed the bag was too big to fit under the seat. I was forced to pay $100 at the gate for a bag that I have never had an issue with fitting under the seat. If I had known that my usual bag was “too big” (which it’s not, I could have easily fit it under my seat) I would have paid for a carryon beforehand and saved money. I am a struggling college student and they are scamming their customers. I have been a loyal Frontier customer since I was 10 years old as an unaccompanied minor, and now I will never fly Frontier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Las Vegas,October 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  At boarding there was a lady who made me pay $100 for my backpack claiming it was too big since it didn't fit the measuring bin. I've been traveling once every week to San Diego carrying the same backpack since last March with frontier and Spirit airlines. No one opposed that backpack size or made me pay $100. How can someone pay $100 for a backpack for a one hour trip. This is unacceptable. One of the staff told me the rule has been always there but now they started to enforce it. What's the whole point of purchase a cheap ticket (that is no longer check due to inflation) if you end up paying for your backpack. I'd rather purchase a United or Delta airlines since they don't make you pay for a backpack and there service is way better as a whole.

Flight was over 2 hours delayed and running behind, and they held everyone checking bag sizes and while up charging fees, also for my backpack.

Most didn't even know their job. Had to keep getting different tickets because the first ones given to us were no good. Waiting on tarmac 30 minutes or better, because they had no place for us to go. The great deal turned into your worst nightmare. Don't waste your money there, go elsewhere and enjoy your flight."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Las Vegas,October 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will never fly Frontier again. I had a party of 3 (myself, husband and sister in-law) for which we all had the same ""personal item"" sized bag that was within Frontiers measurements as a ""personal item"". I have used these same bags many times flying Frontier and ordered these specific bags because the measurements are within their guidelines. My husband got thru with his bag after arguing with the workers that it was indeed within their guidelines. The employee said the ""personal"" item needs to simply fit in their box and it cannot be forced in. My husbands bag clearly fit in the box and they let him thru. Myself and sister in law (remind you, same bags as my husband just different color) did not pass their inspection because of the way we packed and our bags were sticking out. After arguing with the rude staff, I was left with no other choice but to pay for our bags. Little did I know, they charge $99.00 per bag at the gate!! That is $198.00 for the 2 bags. On our flight back from from Las Vegas to Denver; all 3 of my bags were not an issue. I don't understand how my bags magically shrunk especially since I did some shopping and was able to fit it in my bag! I contacted customer service for which I was on hold for over an hour before I could get to someone, all for them to tell me bag fees are non-refundable and they leave it up to the workers at the gate to determine if a bag is within or not within their guidelines. I submitted a claim to their claims department and even provided pictures that we took and it still wasn't enough! There are some major inconsistencies with Frontier. If Frontier wants to check everyone's personal item, that is fine however, you should note the personal item needs to be smaller than the measurements of 14""X18""X8"". And you should be checking those carry on bags to make sure they also fit in your measurement bin because I guarantee they will not fit! And if that is the case, they should not be considered a carry on item, they should be considered a checked bag! Frontier has lost my business along with my family and extended family! "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,July 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I have never had such a lousy experience with an airline in my entire life. And it isn't because of the uncomfortable seating, which is another problem all together. The problem with Frontier is that not one employee I spoke with is helpful in anyway. I opened a credit card with Frontier for the mileage program, and the company will not allow me to book a flight with these miles. I called on Monday, they say to call back because their system is down. I call Tuesday, same answer. On Wednesday I give one representative my information and spend over an hour and a half on the phone waiting to be transferred to the person who can help me. After waiting for that long the same guy picks up and says there is nothing he can do the system is down. So I ask to speak to his manager. He then puts me on hold for another 30 minutes and gives me to some guy who was not his manager and just said they couldn't do anything. So I asked to speak to an actual manager and they hung up the call. This company is poorly run to say the least. Have people who are passionate about your company who can help with issues, not just foreigners reading scripts who have absolutely no idea what to do."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I did not fly on the flight because my 9 year old daughter (also a passenger) tested positive for Covid-19 on a home testing kit administered an hour before we had to leave for the airport. I gave her 3 tests to make sure the result was accurate. We were scheduled to fly on an overnight flight from Las Vegas to RDU. I called Frontier and told the agent the circumstances and he told me that he would cancel the flight and that I would get a refund if I could provide a positive lab administered PCR test the next day. I submitted the positive PCR test, but my refund was denied. I have appealed that decision and the refund was once again denied. I asked the agent what I should have done, and the agent inferred I should have flown because I did not have a PCR test. Frontier in effect encourages passengers to fly with Covid-19 and yet does not require that passengers wear masks! I feel like I am being punished (to the tune of nearly $600 for being responsible in my concern for the safety of other passengers!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Boston via Orlando,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,2,no,2," Ontario to Boston via Orlando. Tiny, cramped seats that did not recline. Tiny tray table. Unfriendly flight attendants. Exorbitant prices for counter check-in and baggage fee. I did not receive an email with a check-in link prior to the flight. There were no check-in kiosks either which would reduce the fees and streamline check-in. I can only conclude that this negligence was purposeful so that you are forced to pay the additional fees: 25.00 just to check in! and an additional 79.00 for the bag. They punish you for not checking in online but they did not send a check-in email. Also, there was no food offered on the 5-hour flight. Will not fly Frontier again."

The worst customer service and rudest people I’ve ever dealt with when I’ve flown. During a “system maintenance” their entire site was down and tickets couldn’t be accessed. I had my ticket and was at the airport an hour and a half in advance and yet because of the maintenance, they had a line wrapped around the airport as people had to wait to get their tickets printed. They didn’t care about urgency. They didn’t care that I was going to miss my flight. I tried explaining and they just rolled their eyes at me."

We were returning home to Denver after our vacation. When I got to Cancun airport 3 hours before my flight, I was told at the frontier counter that my 6 month old baby that was flying with me was not checked in. I had email confirmation that the baby was added as lap infant and i even presented the email sent to me by Frontier airlines, but staff who was at the counter was very rude, she barely knew what she was doing and charged me for the baby plus assistance fee for me and my husband. She refused to listen to any of our comments and said if we refused to pay right away, we had to go behind the line which had at least over 200 people. She charged us $60 that we did not have to pay in the first place. Lap infant is free but I am disappointed that I was charged for the baby who was already on my ticket plus she charged me and husband assistance fee because we stood at her counter to resolve the baby’s ticket issue. Never flying Frontier again and would not recommend it to others either."

The flight was to leave the airport at 10:45am and we did not leave until around 3. We were to be to Disney the following morning. The employees were extremely unprofessional and to top it off we each got a $10 voucher to eat during a 15 hour flight delay. TEN DOLLARS! The water is $5 alone in an airport. Children were missing birthdays and Disney as well. The pilot walks by us and says he's going to sleep first then we can fly. The police were called because of this issue, and when the police arrived to the scene it was the Frontier employees that were being so unprofessional that the police left and told the employees to figure it out for themselves. There were 10 different excuses for the delay as well. There was no definitive answer as to when the flight would come. Every hour it would change so we couldn't even leave to spend the day outside of the airport. I had my own five year old with me and many other kids the same age. They behaved better than the employees. It was the most unprofessional setting I have ever witnessed. Pathetic airline."

Upon verifying the gate, we discovered it was changed from D gates to E gates in LAS, causing us to have to haul ass to get to our gate on time. There was zero communication about this change from Frontier via email or via their app. In this day & age, most people are not visiting ticket counters, so this is not only an oversight on Frontiers last, but it’s also hugely embarrassing that they can’t communicate with their customers."

Frontier has now made it a primary priority of cutting corners and hiking prices while decreasing quality of service. I always travel with a backpack as my personal item and the first time, most recently, I tried to slide it into the bin it didn't fit and the Frontier employee said, ""Sorry, you will have to step out of the line and pay for the bag."" I then turn it at a different angle and slide it in so that it does fit but the Frontier employee had already made up her mind that I will be paying an extra $100 no questions asked. When i asked an Frontier employee about this they just shook their head and said, ""I'm just doing my job, and these are the regulations for flying on Frontier, i don't make the rule."" As a fellow business owner, a business should never treat it's customers like this in no way, shape, or form. I will never be flying Frontier any time soon in the future and I recommend to others that they avoid this airline at all costs because no matter what you pay for the ticket in the beginning there is always a hidden cost at the end and Frontier does their best to keep that motto their public standard."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Denver,October 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The trick is to just get into Zone 1 to avoid paying for the bags. When they asked for Zone 2-3 I scanned my ticket to get inside, the attendant stopped me and about ~40% of the passengers to check for the bag size. Okay, who carries only a purse to travel? Not many. Of course many of us were flagged and had to pay $90. My bag was really close to fitting inside the tiny dimension so I pushed in the corners and the attendant says “ma’am, you’re not allowed to push inside. It doesn’t fit. You need to pay $90”. They were looking for the bag to slide inside by itself via gravity, which is ridiculous. I tried a few more times and she then told me to stop holding the line. I then consolidated and  my backpack slid inside by itself. I was told to go back into the line and when I scanned the second time, the attendant flagged me again  and said that backpack looked too big to be a carry on - he asked the other attendant who saw my bag going in said “she’s okay” multiple times but this attendant didn’t believe it. I had to go through it one more time- which was utterly disgusting that they really wanted me to pay that badly. I showed it again to both attendants and it was fine. Please avoid this airline as they prioritize ripping off $90/bag and losing customers (many were pretty upset about this whole bag situation- someone even said “I’m not riding this airline anymore”). Frontier needs to less enforce this or the airline goes down with a lot less customers."

Then, I received an email flight cancellation and a $75 cancellation fee! I was supposed to fly out the next day. I called customer service back to explain what happened and asked that they correct the error. After being on the phone for 2 hours, I was told that I would receive a call back in 48 hours. I explained that my flight was in 24 hours and I can't get on the flight since the representative mistakenly cancelled it. I was told that I just had to wait until they could review the recording of the call and it will take up to 48 hours. They would not expedite the issue even though they knew that I was supposed to get on the flight in less than 24 hours. I asked if they could escalate the error to a manager and was told no. They said they need to review the recording of the phone call and it will take 48 hours and that's all they can do. The customer service is horrible.

While they never provided any extras, I always found the aircrafts to be clean and on time. After my experience with Frontier today, October 2022, I will never fly Frontier again. The customer service of Frontier is insulting. Our flight was already over 30 minutes late and the gate agents had every single passenger put their backpack in the luggage check. For reference, my backpack contained two outfits and a toothbrush. If your bag did not fit, you were charged one hundred dollars, additionally, a man behind me was having technical problems with his phone and asked for his boarding pass to be printed. They charged him twenty five dollars. These charges are no way to treat passengers at all. I encourage everyone to choose another airline. While it may look more expensive when booking, if you account for all of the hidden fees of frontier, you are in fact saving money."

It doesn’t specify if dependents are not included like they do for the bags. Plus, I was able to do the check in on the way back so, I didn’t need help with boarding passes. I just needed to throw my checked bag to go on the plane, and for that, which I couldn’t do a self service because they do not have it, was charged for the service fee again. Plus, they don’t have priority boarding like most airlines, not even for people with obvious disabilities, they charge for snacks and drinks, they don’t accept cash, and the amount of extra fees in your ticket is ridiculous."

Which would be fine if the staff by the gate addressing it or at least we measure it. I walked through the gate as usual, no one said anything. (By the way it perfectly fits their personal item size chart). I didn’t even know I got charged until I randomly checked my bank account after landing. I called Customer Service, and got connected after a long wait with a supervisor who barely spoke any English, it was echoed like he was speaking from an empty concert hall and told me 15x this cannot be refunded because there is no comment by the charge. Comment what the airline worker was responsible to put there. I asked how can you charge me 2x if you don’t even know if I will have any baggage on the way back? After that he hung up on me.

I then spend over an hour on the phone during my vacation to re-do the cancelation which the representative could not understand and I kept having to explain that they canceled the flight. She then assured me it was done - but it wasn't. They were charging me for all the cancelation fees. I then spent another hour and a half on chat. I kept receiving answers that were scripted that did not solve my problem. I was repeatedly told to wait ""two minutes"" which was 8 minutes and then over 12. When I finally asked to speak to a supervisor I was never allowed to. I filed their complaint form and again received lots of links to their ""policy"" and answers to questions I wasn't asking.

They kept us there, no just me but every body including people in wheelchairs and little kids waiting for 5 hours until around 3:30 pm, they announced that the flight was not going to happen and that It was cancelled. People working there at the counter were rude and arrogant. They do not have any notion as to what customer service means. They did not care about the people who were waiting there and did not even offer a cup of water or anything. They took no responsibility what so ever instead they responded by being super rude and vicious. In the end, they send everyone to ticketing where we all need to take a train. When we got there I was with my elderly mother on a wheelchair, and this supervisor I spoke with in a rude manner asked me and my mom to stand with the rest of people a the end of the line with this long line with my mother who is 90 years old. After waiting there on the line for 1 more hour they informed me what they did not provide any hotels or food vouchers to people at all. I lost my hotel reservation in San Francisco because this airline did not take any responsibility for the service they provide. Other airlines when this happen would make available another plain to prevent situations like this. But Frontier is the worse airline I have ever experienced. I do not recommend this airline to anyone. "

The customer service is horrible. The flight delay (2hrs) caused me to miss a very important meeting and there were no accommodations from the airline. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was flat out told no! The carry on baggage coat $160 round trip!! Lesson learned not to ever fly this airline again.

My son boarded a flight in Buffalo and was told that his bag was fine for under the seat. In Denver they told him it was too big. When he tried to pay they told him he would miss his flight and to throw away his clothes! He did! I called multiple times where I was hung up on! Never use this airline! Delta, United, southwest, and JetBlue have been amazing! "

We went to customer service and they said we would receive a full refund and to look for an email within the hour. We never received any email. We were forced to purchase a new flight with American Airlines that cost $360 per ticket one way. When we got to San Diego, we tried to confirm the refund as we never received anything from them. They said the flight wasn’t canceled and that we never showed up. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again! They stole from hundreds of people."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,October 2022,,,,,,,1,no,2,  I was effected by hurricane Ian we had some damage but was without power and internet also with damage to cell towers the phone service was spotty. I requested a refund do to the fact that the effects of a natural disaster made it impossible for us to travel and also neatly impossible to reach the company. I was denied the refund it was only $148. So many companies and organizations have stepped up to help people effected by the hurricane it is so sad that a company like frontier could care less about its customers. This was a natural disaster it was not the fault of it’s customers.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Seattle via Las Vegas,October 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  18 hour layover added after the fact, 1 hour ""maintenance delay"", 4 hour delay, 11 minute delay added after. It would be a $200 Charge to remove the layover they added after we already payed. The Layover was specifically in Las Vegas, which makes me question if they have some sort of deal with the gambling here for people on lay overs. Ends up costing more than other airlines because of their fees and sketchy tactics."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Houston,October 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,  I’ve been flying for over 8 years and I’ve never once had this experience with Frontier. Me and my family are skaters so our carry on is our skates because we will not check them in because of past experiences and lost items. This flight was the very first time we’ve ever been made to pay for our carry on bag. Very very disappointed. It is not our fault that they over book the flights and it is not right for them. Had to pay $200 for 2 bags when we could’ve flown a different airline with nicer qualities. It’s crazy how we flew to Denver with no issues and our bags were fine. There’s even open spaces still for carry ons and they made us pay. I will never fly this airline ever again

Frontier staff and Customer service said they can't refund my trip money including 100$ bag fee. Never fly with them. Very unprofessional staff. The attitude towards the customers is very rude. The bag we bought perfectly fits in the measurement box for the free baggage. They said it should fit loosely. Such a joke! One of the Frontier staff even agreed it fits and was trying to convince other staff members but they weren't convinced and asked to pay $100.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Trenton to Orlando,September 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  By far the worst trip I've ever taken. It was my first time flying frontier, but also my last. The staff is extremely rude. At the gate, I was asked to put my personal item in the measuring bin. It fit easily, however, the lady eyes my wallet in my hand (which slings around my shoulder) and says ""this has to fit in the bin too because it's a personal item"". That makes absolutely no sense and I wasn't able to fit the wallet in the bin as well - she created such a ruckus and made me rearrange my entire backpack for a wallet. This weight thing is ridiculous first of all, and having absolutely no leniency for something as small as a wallet is just absurd. It felt like they're out to make your trip as stressful as it can be. Furthermore, they gave my friend a really hard time about her baby's car seat. She paid for an extra seat for her 6-month-old, and had called and confirmed that she could put the car seat on the seat. However, they refused to let her bring it in at the gate, and made her pay an extra $70 for ""extra luggage"". This is the worst flight, worst crew and worst service I've ever seen. Not worth the ""cheap tickets"" because they charge insane amounts at the gate for stupid reasons."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Madison ,October 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We travel with Frontier between DEN and PHX and DEN and MSN often. As carriers go, Frontier has consistently delivered a decent experience and has been more or less what you would expect from a discount airline. My now seven year old daughter loves flying Frontier because of the animals on the tail and wings. She really treasures the animal cards the flight attendants give her. Since we fly Frontier often, we make sure to only bring items that fit in the sizer and have been bringing the same bags for years. My daughter's little suitcase she brings just fits in the bin. Today, Weds, Oct 5th. as we happily boarded our 10am flight from DEN to MSN, we endured the usual bag size check. When I attempted to move the wheels of the bag so the bag could slide into the sizer, I was told that if I had to do anything to make the bag fit in the bin that we would have to stop boarding and pay a $99 carry on fee to bring the bag with us. I told the gate attendant (who I later learned was the manager) that I did not have $100 to spend and that we needed to get to WI so my daughter could see her grandparents. My daughter, upon hearing this exchange, burst out crying. The manager offered no kind words and sent me to the back of another line. We waited for a short time, my daughter sobbing as I tried to comfort her. When we got up to the front, the gate agent informed us we needed to pay $99 to board the flight with my daughter's bag. I let her know that the bag did fit and that it was the same bag we always brought when we flew Frontier. She offered no empathy and when asked to get the manager simply pointed at the gate agent that had sent us to her in the first place. When I insisted I talk to him she ignored me, told me to move, and began serving other customers to one side of my daughter and I when I refused and requested to speak to her manager again. After this, my daughter and I, both crying and feeling humiliated, stood to the side as several of our fellow passengers offered to pay the $99 so we could board the plane. I moved my daughter's belongings from her suitcase to a souvenir bag we bought at the nearest store and tried to comfort her while telling her we needed to throw away her suitcase (blue with rainbows, bought when she was three and one of her favorite things) so we could board the plane. Just as I was about to leave the suitcase to board the plane, crying in earnest, completely embarrassed, with my daughter sobbing, the gate agent called us back over and let us know that her manager had elected to pay for our carry on himself. I apologized for being short with her earlier and she swiped a card (presumably the manager's) and payed for my daughter's suitcase as a carry on. The manager scanned our boarding passes, saying nothing about what had happened, and we boarded the plane. After this experience, I can't foresee flying Frontier again. Yeah, it turned out okay in the end, but the best thing about it was the care my fellow passengers showed to a mama and her crying child. I'd prefer my money go to pretty much any other airline or mode of transport. It's also really disappointing that Frontier puts its front line employees in the position they do. I don't want to support that either. Next time you want to pay to endure humiliation, sit in a tiny seat, pay a premium for luggage and be spoken to in a condescending manner by gate staff, fly Frontier!"

Once I finally was able to board my last flight (out of 4) they didn’t have enough people on the flight and started charging for carry on bags. Luckily, I flew with them before and haven’t been charged for my small backpack my last 3 flights so I didn’t have to pay. They made me pay $100 to take a small backpack on that for the last 4 flights I had I was able to put it under the seat. This airline is disgusting. They know nothing about good customer service, they take advantage of people."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to New York LGA,September 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had one of the worst experiences riding with Frontier Airlines the morning of September 30th, leaving from gate D1A. My flight originally was supposed to board around 7:12am and didn’t board until a little after 12 pm, so it was over a four hour wait to begin with. However the rude experience happened as the other customers and myself began to board. The supervisor in charge asked passengers to check the size of their bag, I had no problem checking my bag as my bag was under the requirement size. Went Back to the supervisor who was busy checking ppl in and told her it fit, she then rudely told me to go back and call her to check which I did. However I now had to wait as others were ahead of me. Before I was finished checking once again she began telling me that I took too long and she’s closing the door. I began asking her why she was closing the door on me after a four hour wait and after waiting online to check my bag size. I began to cry letting her know I’m traveling to a funeral. She leaves towards the plane shuts the door. Comes back and tells me to come. As we are walking to the plane she says I was going to let you fly but just had to make you sweat. She was the most unprofessional and rude person I have ever encountered traveling. I will try my best to never take frontier after that experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Philadelphia via Denver,April 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight home to see my family for the first time in years. I'd made it through the entire pandemic unscathed - naturally, the day of my flight I started to feel pretty sick. Out of an abundance of caution, I took an at home COVID test and popped for positive; my flight was only a few hours later, so I quickly got in touch w/ Frontier to see what they recommended. The person with whom I chatted told me that I needed an 'official' positive test from a clinic/doctors office - at home test would not be submitted. He also specified that it needed to be within 4 days prior to the flight. Obviously, as there was hours remaining, I continued to press in the chat that I had no problem getting the test, but that it would clearly not be from 4 days before. Me - ""If I am able to schedule for today, is that sufficient?"" Frontier - ""If you're unable to make your flight today, you can still submit medical documentation."" Me - ""I will definitely not be on the flight today, for the safety of the crew and other passengers. What is the correct course of action from your end - should I simply not show up? Or is there something that must be done from your end?"" Frontier - ""The option here is to cancel the flight and you can submit a positive result of covid from testing facility, doctor's office, or clinic."" The first available test was the following morning - as requested, I went, test, showed positive, and submitted. Frontier refuses to honor the chat. They also are totally unwilling to entertain the idea that it was not possible to set up a same-day, in-clinic COVID test at 3PM. Their email back. ""Dear xxxxx, Thank you for taking the time to write to us. I am sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the resolution that was offered. It is never our intention to be insensitive to our customer’s opinions regarding their experience with Frontier Airlines. The airline has guidelines and policies in place to help ensure that all passengers are handled in a consistent manner for most situations that are encountered. While reviewing the message you forwarded, it shows that the chat agent already informed you that all documentation provided will be subject for approval. Jude also stated that we are requiring a testing documentation from a medical provider within 4 days prior to travel. And that at-home test will not accepted. However, the testing documentation you provided was outside the 4 days prior to travel that we require as per policy. We must respectfully inform you that we are unable to grant an exception to policy. We appreciate the feedback you have provided.

Then we stayed the night at a hotel by the airport. Our flight on Frontier was at 7.15am. We’re waiting for the shuttle to the airport and my wife shows me an email from Frontier saying the flight was cancelled. So we went ahead to the airport thinking they could get us on a later flight. They told us the next flight to Punta Cana was next Saturday! What? And they couldn’t help us connect to on another airline. Totally unhelpful and acted like they literally couldn’t care less about us. So we went back to the hotel and thankfully they let us back in our room since it was still only 6am. We started making phone calls to the airline and the travel agent. Frontier again had nothing. Travel agent said they could get us on a Flight on Tuesday. That would basically cut our vacation in half. So we decided to just cancel everything and reschedule. Thank you Frontier for ruining our Anniversary vacation! You have lost a customer for life and I will tell everyone I know about my experience. I seriously hope you go out of business.

They appear inexpensive, but they have hidden fees. The cost will be more than flying with a more expensive airline. They charge for bags each way, and you cannot print a boarding pass at the airport without paying a fee of $25.00. You are also paying for seating both ways separately. Like I said hidden fees! They are not cheap, they are more and they don’t even offer you a free snack or drink. There is no Wi-Fi to use on the flight and the seats don’t recline."

Nothing like delaying a flight for that. If they are that concerned maybe they need a process for while the plane is unloading or force the check in to be in person to do that so the flight wouldn't be late. Staff is very rude off and on the plane. I will not be flying with them again!

I alerted her that I had travelled with the same bag and was not charged on the initial trip. She was rude, belligerent, threatening me in the presence of other passengers that I would not board the flight. Insisting I had to pay $99 for a small bag. I was embarrassed and told her multiple times that she did not have to be rude and could handle this in a civil manner. She continued to be rude and belligerent. Worst experience. Moreover the flight is uncomfortable, the attendants are rude, the plane was dirty with several alcohol bottles under my seat. I made the attendants aware of the alcohol bottles, and they said ""We don't know anything about that we came on the flight at the same time you did. Worst experience.

We tried to get our money returned so we could get another flight with another airline but Frontier would not return our cash, they only wanted to provide a credit for future flights. This was awful we were traveling with 7 children and 4 were under the age of four. We fought for the return of out money but Frontier refused. Having no other monies for another flight we were forced to take this 6am flight. We and many other travels were held up at TSA and at least 30 of us missed this flight and were stranded in Florida. the next flight out from Frontier wasn't until the next day at 9pm. Frontier didn't offer a free night stay anywhere (as stated in Consumer Affairs) the only thing the offered to us were 60% of the cost of our flight for a future flight period. We ended up driving back to Detroit and spending 600.00 for that experience. I would not recommend Frontier Airlines to my enemy! "

Now I had to book a new flight with short notice and spend an extra $1000. If this wasn't bad enough, last year they cancelled my return flight from Mexico 1 week before was supposed to fly. Just cancelled it, refunded me and offered no other options for flights. That time it cost me $1500 to get new ticket. I am basically out $2500 with this airlines. Don't ever fly with them if you have plans that can't be changed at last minute. I would give them negative stars if I could."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Fransisco to Atlanta,September 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is the single worst flight and customer service experience I have ever had. It took me longer to get from San Francisco to Atlanta than it did for me to get from New Zealand to San Francisco. We showed up 3.5 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart, only to be told that the flight had been delayed. It was then further delayed. Our 11pm flight was delayed to 3am. So we went to sleep in the airport. When we showed up to check in before our flight, we were told that TSA had just closed and so although our flight was there waiting for us, we (along with about 15 others) were stranded on the wrong side of the airport and couldn't get through. We were then moved to a 6am flight, which had a couple of hours layover in Denver CO, even though we had originally booked a direct flight. Once we got on the plane in Denver, there were mechanical issues and we had to wait on the runway for an extra hour. All they offered us this entire time was a glass of water on that flight. After the flight they sent us a $50 voucher each expiring in December, which is useless to me as I don't live in the USA. When I asked if they could give us food vouchers at the airport, they said no I would need to email customer service, and when I emailed customer service they said no those at the airport will need to sort that out for you - I don't know who is lying but something doesn't line up.

I’ve flown at least 200 times (many times with a frontier, and I have never heard of such a preventable issue in my life) If I could give negative stars, I would. I woke up at 4am to board at 7am to wait for 2 hours without any compensation or reassurance.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Denver,September 2022,1.0,4.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I am not one to complain or write reviews, but this one needs it. Frontier is known to have cheaper flights, but then charge you for every add on. I knew this booking my flight and was fine with it. I was traveling by myself and knew I wouldn't need any add-ons. Bringing a small backpack, that was less than 18""x14""x8"", no problem. My wife flew the exact same flight the previous weekend, same backpack, no issues. When I went to board the flight in Harrisburg back home to Denver, they charged me $89 at the gate for my small backpack. I even emailed the airlines with dimensions and pictures of the backpack after the flight and they wanted nothing to do with it. Do not advertise you can bring on a small hand bag with specified dimensions, if you, the airline, aren't going to comply with the rules. Way to go nickeling and diming anyone who flies by you. So, my now affordable flight, became the same cost as any other airline that offers a free check in. Not worth the hassle of trying to guess if you're going to get up-charged depending on the staff working that day. For goodness sakes, just say, pay for any luggage, that way I could have paid ahead and known it wasn't any savings from Delta, United, American, Southwest or any of the other reputable airlines. Way to go, making a dime off of your customers, Frontier."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to San Diego,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our luggage has been missing August 28. When we were in Dallas our flight was delayed due to weather, but then it was canceled we spent two hours on the runaway after they decided that they were going to cancel the flight. We literally saw them taking all the bags off the plane in Dallas. When we got off the plane there was nowhere to get our bags because it was really late in the evening. We filed a claim and staff said she guaranteed she would find our bag. She had us fill out a claim form and guarantee that she was route for us but never did. The next day I filed a claim online. We did not ask for reimbursement of our hotel nor our clothes that we had to buy. We did not get to leave until two days later because of weather. During this time we filed another claim with a manager at the airport who once again said that not finding baggage is not in there vocabulary and it was never filed. We decided to put our computer in my medication bags because Frontier charges so much for checking bags or carry-ons and we figured it was a straight through flight. He was to say that didn’t work out. We filed several other claims online filled out everything that was lost. No one responded to us or reached out to us until about two weeks ago. A manager from the San Diego airport which was our final destination Called is said that they had one of our bags. At this point it was a month approximately since we didn’t have our bags. They would not deliver it to me at my house I had to go pick it up because he wanted me to make sure to look in it to see what was missing. The manager at frontier baggage and San Diego told me well maybe your medication is in the other bag remember you flipped out and you said more things were gone. I said yes I understand but I know for a fact that my medications were in this bag. She kept on telling me they probably weren’t there in the other bag that they still can’t find. They couldn’t track our bags at all. I was told that I need to call Dallas frontier baggage and try to find my baggage myself while they try to do it as well. I do not feel like that is my responsibility this is absolutely ridiculous the time that We’ve been having to wait. Nobody has reached out to us to ask if we would like to be compensated for our baggage. We do you want to be compensated but nobody’s offered even if we were still compensated we need that computer because it has all of our information for our business. Staff at frontier baggage and San Diego told me the day I picked up my luggage that she would be getting in contact with me she never did so I called back another person and they said that they still haven’t found my bag.

I have flown with them 3 times now and not once have they left on time. Each time we board almost an hour late, the last flight we sat in the plane for an hour and 25 mins while they tried to find the missing luggage. It is not worth it for the price. Just pay the extra 100 for a different airline that actually treats you well and can get you placed on time."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Chicago,June 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I was on my way back from Phoenix to Chicago. Other than my flight from Chicago to PHX, which was with American Airlines, I was able to get my ticket at the machines, but in Phoenix, the Airline Frontier did not offer this function, nor was it possible to check in online in advance. I had to wait in a long line, and we all did not see any progress for over 45 minutes. We saw the reason for that was the lady at the kiosk happily involved in a loud conversation with two women about private contents. When it was finally my turn, she told me that it was too late for me, she was not able to print out my ticket. She forwarded me to her supervisor, who understood the situation and she did everything in her power to get me on the flight. She made it happen to print out the ticket after trying it with different devices - then she ran to the gate to wait for me and instructed me to be fast! I ran and, in the crowd, I saw her waiving, and she guided me quickly to the gate. I only had to pass the ticket through the control but then I was told “We are overbooked”. And I missed the flight so to speak twice. The supervisor felt so sorry (she was lovely by the way) and she tried to find another flight with another airline, as Frontier would only offer a flight 2 days later. I flew that day over Kansas City with SW Airlines and it had been a long, long inconvenient day for me. Frontier made it super complicated to get in touch with them afterward, but I found a way after intense researches. Emails went back and forth and they kept on telling me that my documents were not complete or they said it has to be a pdf and nor a jpg, once it was a pdf, they said it has to be bundled, trying to play with customers patience. I just had the feeling they are not even really reading my case. I gave everything what they wanted, but the final answer was just, that they do not refund me, not for the ticket I bought at Frontier, nor for the ticket I was forced to buy at SW Airlines. I would give Miss E, the supervisor in Phoenix 5 stars, but she is clearly working in the wrong company. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again, and I think this is a bigger loss for Frontier, than refunding me the $500, which they owe me."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montego Bay to Raleigh via Orlando,August 2022,4.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was the worst experience traveling. The flight was delayed from Montego Bay to Orlando and the customer service at MBJ was poor. When arrived in Orlando had to stay on board for about hour after plane landed with no explanation, hence connecting flight was missed. My 2 yr old and 11 yr old grandkids were tired and hungry and were not accommodated for. We had to stay hungry the night from 9 pm until the next day. We had to sleep on the dirty airport floor with all kinds of diseases going around. Customer service was the worst. Lady argued with me. 1st time traveling and not even a small chips or anything to sip. Next flight wasn’t available until the following night 8 pm so we were there 24hours. No shower, no food and no bed. My 2 yr old and 11 yr old were crying. Nobody apologized. At 8pm the flight was delayed again until 9 pm. I was very stressed, even my blood pressure went up. When we checked in we had to pay for the 3 checked bags and 1 carry on which were already paid for in the beginning. When my daughter called the airline they promised I would be refunded within 7 to 15 business days. After 15 days when I called they said they’re sorry but it was cancelled so the bags were paid for twice. I have travelled with 4 other airlines and never had the experience. This was the first and definitely last with Frontier."

All of my friends flew Spirit while I flew Frontier. They had no issues but here I am disgruntled. Upon reaching the gate and waiting to board, shortly before boarding, the reservation agent made an announcement that the flight was full so she had 12 free tickets for the first 12 customers to get in line who were willing to sit in the emergency row. I was one of the 12 and she printed me (and the other 11) a new boarding pass which I used for the flight. Despite calling, chatting, using the feedback form, and filing a formal complaint, Frontier has refused to refund me for the flight I paid for as if anyone would scam a $78 flight when my return trip cost double and I provided both boarding passes. Do not trust anything that they say. Poor customer service and deceit. It is the principal of the matter. I am a public school educator. I have no reason to scam an airline for a $78 flight when I have proof of my claim. I have lost all faith in their integrity."

I was with my Dad. I am a college student with a tight schedule. We connected in Las Vegas, and waited 4 hours for a connection. (We would have flown Spirit to CLE via LAS) but by the time I knew my school schedule Spirit’s price has drastically increased, so we settled with Frontier for a better price). We knew that going in so that was an inconvenience for us, but that was the airlines schedule, so they are not at fault here. They were nice and the flights were smooth. We did not purchase a seat for the flight from SNA TO LAS leg and they put us in row 8D and 8E. Contrary to what others say, they put us is in row 8 and kept us together. We got to our destination safety, so it was a good experience. I’d recommend them if you are trying to save money and know what you are getting into in advance. The only thing with Frontier is if you try to call them, they’ll ask questions and lead to the conclusion of visiting their website, then they hang up. No one ever answered. If you do manage to talk, the hold music is extremely annoying. Other than that, flight was nice, clean plane, and that’s that! Both flights were on time, with the second leg arriving pretty early! We lucked out with me being a student in college on a tight schedule and flying an ULCC!"

They even charged us an additional $276 when we checked in the day before our flight for carry-on bags and seat selections, which is ridiculous by itself. We show up to the airport only to be casually told our flight doesn't exist anymore. Over $1200 spent on tickets only to be told they can only refund our money in a week or two. We booked this trip a year ago and lost all of our hotel reservation money..etc because they ever bothered to tell us they canceled our flight. They truly did not care and did absolutely nothing to help us get a flight to our destination. If you want to go somewhere, choose a different airline than Frontier. "

This flight was booked in July for August. This was going to be our first flight of many with frontier to Antigua for business. My mother died. I was one of her caretakers. We could not leave with her being hospitalized. She died the day we were suppose to travel. They offered us a full credit which must be booked in 90 days. Frontier is now not flying from Atlanta to Antigua the rest of this year or next year. They refuse to extend this credit offer. It is completely unacceptable to not extend or offer us a full refund. I provided doctor letter then death certificate and still denying everything we ask. Customer service will never transfer us to a manager and continue to tell us to email which we are doing and get the same answer every time. Never will I ever book with Frontier again. This deserves exposure.

On 9/22/2022 my friends and I were getting ready to head to the airport. Due to weather conditions our flight was canceled. We decided to call Frontier to reschedule our flight for January, they insisted on charging us $100 fee per person. My friends and I lasted over 2 hours waiting to speak to someone and received almost zero assistance. We thought the process would have been easier since we purchased insurance for our flights. Due to the cancellation and the horrible service provided by Frontier, I spent my birthday being on the phone with customer care trying to find a resolution and at the very least, empathy. The customer service representative never provided their name and would repeatedly hang the phone the moment we tried to explain why we wanted to cancel/reschedule. This was absolutely the worst experience I’ve had with an airline and I certainly would not recommend anyone book with a flight with Frontier. Save your time and money."

Gate agent made announcement that Planning Group for Frontier had made arrangements for all connection flights to be made. Once arrived in Denver, missed connection flight to MSO. Frontier customer service said we would be put on next flight out, which was 3 days later. No effort was made to get us on another airline, no effort was made for food, hotel. Customer service just stated ""couldn't help us with that"". Had to purchase another ticket on another airline. Frontier said they would refund us $200/ticket (2 tickets were purchased), yet we only received $178 refund. Customer service thru their website said they couldn't do anything about that, we would have to work it out with Customer Service in Denver, yet they could not give us a phone number to talk to them. Our flight was at 7:30 am from TPA, once we were all loaded up they discovered a maintenance issue. They deplaned us, and moved us to another gate. After a short wait another plane pulled up, but no passengers got off of plane. Passengers joked ""They pulled it out of Maintenance"". We boarded the new plane, and before take off pilot made an announcement ""Plane was in for Maintenance, and the Maintenance had not been done"". We deplaned again. After Maintenance was complete, we boarded again. We understand Maintenance issues happen, but to not help their passengers that are affected by their delays is not acceptable. Worse Customer Service I have ever worked with!!"

We waited 8 hours. For them to tell us it was canceled and our flight wouldn’t fly until the next day. The worse part is that the workers were extremely rude and unhelpful. They denied switching us to a different flight or a different airline. They also couldn’t accommodate us to stay by a near hotel. They did not care or offer solutions. We lost one night at our hotel which was payed for thanks to them. They also charge you 57 for a checked bag and 65 for a carry. I will never fly with them again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to San Antonio,September 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Had to contact customer service beforehand with a question regarding my flight. Even with my specific question and having to use their chat option, as it was after hours for their call center, my question was answered in a satisfactory and efficient manner. Checking in my luggage at ATL was painless and efficient, and the counter attendant was very helpful and courteous. The gate agent, also friendly and courteous, though the boarding process was unnecessarily, slightly confusing. The flight crew and even the pilots, friendly and upbeat. The plane itself, very clean and modern, couldn't have been any more than 3-4 years old. The seat, being within the first 3-4 rows, was remarkably spacious; more spacious than comparable comfort/premium economy sort of seats on Delta, United or American. Departed from Atlanta and arrived into San Antonio both early. I've used numerous budget airline carriers in the US over the years. Some suck (looking at you, Allegiant, Spirit and Southwest!) Others - namely Frontier - have the same business model but have provided me with a better overall experience. In fact, Frontier (at least recently) somewhat reminds me of what Southwest used to be back in the 1990s-2000s. Just don't expect WiFi or free food and drinks; this is still a budget carrier after all."

She explained for the duration on my flight because it is after all one ticket with a layover. The next airport when I was boarding in Denver the lady at the counter was so rude and stated “No girl we ain’t doing all that here! This ain’t them.” Well to the contrary, it is. It’s all one ticket and one airline, Frontier.  They charged me double what I would have paid online, what I originally tried to do. This airline changes peoples location (of flight at the airport) deliberately to make a quick buck. Better listen up because the location changes constantly. I will never fly Frontier again, I should have flown with a decent airline like Delta, I paid the same price. Never again. They treat their customers like trash. "

I have purchased my one way ticket from this Airline, and canceled it like 30 minutes after. I did it through Travelocity because it was the platform I had used. It was a round trip ticket using two different airlines. I didn’t have any problems getting my money back from Delta, they refund my credit card right away; but Frontier didn’t because they have changed their cancellation policy back in June 2022, and in order to have the 24 hour free cancellation policy, we need to buy the tickets more than 7 days prior to the scheduled flight, So, just wanted to warn you about this company!"

I missed my Flight to Denver due to the unforeseen lines at SeaTac to get through security (I waited over 2 hours ) and still wasn’t near the front of the line. I contacted Alaska and they tried to get me on another flight. Unfortunately everything was booked. Alaska gave me a credit to fly again within a year because this was out if my control. Frontier would do nothing for me. I tried canceling my return flight because I wasn’t working in Denver, explained the situation, wasn’t even asking for a refund just credit to fly at a later date. Absolutely no help. I lost all my money because they wouldn’t make any exception. Will never book with them again. And recommend no one else does either."

The cost for any type of luggage was ridiculous. The flight seemed cheaper than most so I paid for the ticket and figured my family member could just pack light and that would be ok. The day of the flight which was 3 weeks after I purchased the ticket, I call to check in and they want almost 100% more of what I paid for the ticket to get boarding passes. They said the rate increased on their end so they had to charge me more. I have flown with most of the airlines out there and I have never had this happen. Frontier are crooks and customer service was a nightmare and kept hanging up on me when I asked for a supervisor. I ended up sending my family member with a different airline company and was out my original ticket price."

However, customer service and their corporate informed me that they weren't able to do so due to the agent at the airport didn't document it in their notes that would've been their proof, smh. It's unfair that I have to take a financial loss due to their mistake. Why should I have to pay for their mishap? This is definitely my 1 and done with this airline. I refuse to support a business who doesn't own up to their own faults. The only star they get are for the polite agents who tried their best to help me. Overall, this airline is for people who's ok with losing unnecessary money thinking they're getting a deal. Will never fly with them again."

Due to severe weather our flight was canceled after sitting on the runway for two hours. Not Frontiers fault for the weather but it is their fault they lost our luggage. It’s September 13, 2022 today. We have filed six claims, five of them were online I’ve sent a letter to them for contact on the clean page to this day we had absolutely no contact with frontier employees. No one contacted us after our claim was put in. We filed a claim in Dallas With a representative gave her all our receipts for the clothes we had to buy he said they would reimbursed us well that girl never filed the claim. Today I went in and updated my claim we’ve added every single item that was in our suitcase. We had a lot of important things in there. Due to their baggage is that cost so much to carry on and check we decided since it was a straight through flight we were just put my medication‘s and computer in our suitcase so we didn’t have to pay another hundred dollars. Well our flight was canceled as I said and we saw our bags being taken off the plane. Our baggage was nowhere to be found. Everybody that helped us never got back in contact us with like they said. No one responded to my message I sent them regarding my claim online asking them what’s going on it’s been quite a long time for the bags to be missing. I will never fly frontier again ever. Today we got a call from San Diego Airport they found one of our bags. They have no clue where the other one is didn’t even know it was on the claim when it clearly states on my online claim that there’s two with two bag numbers, Their flights are cheap but then to check a bag it’s like $50 and if you go over 1 pound they charge you 70 US have to pay for your carry-on.

Even if your personal item met the measurements on the website and was not overpacked, you were charged. My personal item was the same on the way out of Atlanta and was absolutely deemed a personal item - no problem. It was packed exactly the same and this agent in Detroit had a bad day and took it out on several of us. What are we to do, argue with her when she's on a power trip because she knows she can kick us off the flight? Called Frontier for a refund. None of the employees there have a supervisor and they do not claim their airport agents. It's an absolute sham. Despicable airline. You get nothing in flight no wifi, snacks, drinks, movies, nothing. You get miserable rude employees and a run down plane. Do not fly this airline, you will be disappointed."

Frontier you need to get your measurements corrected on your site, because I had to pay $90 to bring my under the seat bag. I didn't even say anything, because they pulled over 20 people to pay for their bags which I know their bags fitted under the seat. What a scam."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,September 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is my first experience flying my Frontier Airlines. Let’s start with the cost, too expensive for the quality. Hidden fees from beginning to end. The gate employees are unprofessional. They eat, laugh out load, are rude, stare and are short with customers. The flight itself was delayed an hour because both pilots were late. The plane was clean but uncomfortable. The seats don’t recline and if someone uses the tray table behind you, you will feel and hear it. On the way home our flight was again delayed. I assumed the first delay was a coincidence, I was wrong. I spoke with a woman who flew Frontier a few times and she said her flights were also delayed. I will pay the same price for better quality elsewhere. Not to mention, no Wi-Fi or complementary drinks or snack during the flight supposedly to cut down flight cost."

Rebook for a flight 2 days later or have the initial flights refunded. We were not local to the Cleveland area and had no where to stay for 2 nights but a hotel. No compensation was offered and when we asked the manager if he expected us to sleep at the airport for 48 hours and he said yes. Made a complaint online with customer service and was told they wouldn’t honor any accommodations and it was up to us to pay for anything other than the flight. Paid 2x as much to fly from a different airline at an airport 1.5 hours away and had to rent a car and pay for the hotel ourselves. Will never fly with them again.

No email or notification about cancellation of flight. Only available option was to have a 8 hour layover in Denver. Get to Denver, and we receive a notification that there is another delay. The board is still showing on time, as well as their online services. I have to tell the customer service rep about the delay because he didn’t believe me. I asked about if/when the flight is cancelled, will they help with putting me and my 8 month pregnant wife in a hotel, he said that he needs to follow protocol. I didn’t even realize that Frontier has Protocol with how unorganized and complete lack of urgency for their paying customers. Will never ever fly this airline again no matter what."

Charge you for everything including customer service help. We found a couple of helpful staff members but we also found a few that have no business being in customer service. They were not helpful and rude. Employees were difficult to find or nonexistent. At MSP, our bags did not show up and there were zero Frontier employees there because there were no out going flights. We landed at 2 pm on a Sunday. Unacceptable. We weren’t the only ones, there was about 6 of us that had misplaced bags. We called customer service and told to fill out a form online and “someone “ will contact you in 24-48 hours. Frontier lost my parents bags a few years ago. My dad’s new $500 prescription glasses were in the bag. Frontier gave them $250. That’s it. My mom had just bought new clothes and expensive makeup for the trip. Frontier did not care. This is two strikes and I’m not giving this airline an attempt at 3. My husband and I will never fly this airline again and we travel often."

Before I made the reservations, I contact passport service and asked if I would get back my daughter’s passport in time to make the trip (October). I was told it shouldn’t be a problem, so with this information I made the reservations via Expedia. On September 8th I called passport services again and ask for the status of the passports. I was informed they would take longer than anticipated and would not have them in time for the trip. With this new information I contacted Expedia to cancel the trip. They did an excellent job in getting a refund from the hotel. When they (Expedia) contact Frontier Airlines, they were told that I needed to contact them (Frontier) directly. I called Frontier on 9-10-22 and was told they would not issue a refund and if Expedia wanted to issue a refund they could. At this point my tickets/travel were not confirmed and according to various resources I should have received a refund. When I explained to the agent at Frontier, he “didn’t care” and was not going to issue a refund. When asked to speak to a supervisor he refused. I find this type of behavior outrageous, insensitive and extremely unprofessional. It’s obvious that Frontier only cares about its bottom line and not “customer services.” "

I arrived at the airport with 40 minutes before my flight (I have TSA precheck so I wasn’t worried). I get to the gate and their computer is down meaning they can’t check in bags. Lady at the counter takes 15 minute minutes to say ‘you could go through security but they will charge $99 for the bag’ then I mention that it’s already paid for but because I had a backpack I’d still need to. I try buying it online cheaper and it goes through. Get to the flight and they are not letting anyone in. I explain I was delayed because the lady at check in was going in circles and I already paid for my bags. Missed the flight and now they say call customer service. I rebook with another airline cause at this point the next flight is not for 24 hours. Call customer service and stay on hold for 30 minutes, explain my issue then phone goes silent. Call back, they hang up. I used to fly them all the time in early 2010s and it was my favorite. Now this is tied with Spirit Airlines."

They wanted to charge another 50 for a helmet only to sit on city bus quality of seats that don’t recline, also they are so cheap that they weren’t running the air in Arizona in early sept so it was 90 plus in the plane and smells like exhaust fumes.

Leading to a missed connection. I was left stranded in another state. I spoke to multiple people over a course of 3 hours. They said they couldn’t do anything to get me to my destination. My trip was fully insured. Most of the issue came from multiple changes in flights and gates. Customer service is rude and will point you in to circles. I had to purchase a new ticket through a different airline to get me to my final destination which cost me hundreds. What is the point of insuring your flight if they do nothing to help you if an issue like this arises.

I told the gentlemen that I’m glad this is recorded cause I don’t want my flight canceled, keep my flight money, and I will never use them again. With the way the economy is and wanting to charge more money for situations out of your control is ridiculous, now not only am I not going home I’m sitting with no money that could help me until I got paid, Frontier don’t care and they show it with their empty apologies and non customer service help.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Atlanta,September 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I was scheduled to leave Friday 9/2 via delta from Atlanta to Denver and fly back to Atlanta from Denver on Monday 9/5 via Frontier. I planned to meet my friend in Denver to hike in Rocky Mtn national Forrest. That Monday morning on August 29 I woke up sick. I knew I was flying and was worried about it being Covid so I took a home test that was positive. On top of everything else, my friend broke her foot the day before. There was no way this trip was happening. I immediately called to cancel my Frontier flight. I was offered 1/2 credit. Of my $256 ticket. I could have the other half if I could prove I had covid and home test were not valid. So I scheduled a test and the only appointment I could get was Saturday 9/3. Of course my test came back negative so I’m out $126. My 1/2 credit is only good for 90 days. Delta gave me full credit. Good for a year, no questions asked. Which seems more reasonable from a customer service point of view. I know I did not purchase flight insurance and so I appreciated the credit Delta gave me. I feel like Frontier should’ve given me a full credit with a longer time to use it as well. My friend is a traveling healthcare worker and I’m not sure where she is settling next. I may never get to use these credits. I booked it through Expedia.  The last time I flew I purchased flight insurance and never needed it. So I didn’t do it this time. I know this was my mistake and I will never purchase tickets again without flight insurance. Booking sites have less neon signs about flight insurance. It’s usually a box you check. I canceled my Frontier flight 7 days before departure. Had I purchased their works package (and known to) I could’ve received a full refund. I’ve read they are expanding and if that’s true they really should modify there half credit policy to stay competitive with other airlines. It blew my mind that Delta asked no questions and gave me a full credit, while I felt like Frontier was judging me for what I felt was an emergency or simply trying to do the responsible thing and not get on a plane if I have Covid or any contagious illness. This post asked me for a boarding ticket to prove the validity of my post but I never got one being that I canceled it but I did provide my confirmation number. So hopefully they will post this and help me educate others out there who do not fly often and do not know these things."

Flight price was $193 for 2 travelers one way, which was a good price, but then you have to buy your seat, you have to pay to check a bag, and you have to pay more for a carry-on bag. We are now close to $400 for our flight. Then we notice that my wife’s name is not spelled correctly, so we change the name and then get charged the next day on our credit card an additional $212 to change her name. The original flight was only $193, but we are charged $212 to change her name. Apparently $75 to make the change and then an additional $137 increase on the flight price. Called Frontier to complain and I was told that name change charges are non refundable even though we think the mistake was on their end. As for the rest of the flight, check in staff were rude, plane was uncomfortable. The whole experience was the worst I have ever had on any flight and I will never fly Frontier Airlines ever again."

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bradley to Atlanta,August 2022,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I've been flying for 30 years and I have never experienced such horrible service as yours. Our family flew from Hartford, CT to Atlanta GA 3 weeks ago for a much anticipated vacation. We arrived at the airport in CT 2.5h before the flight. We went to check bags (which we paid for in advance) and there was nobody at the desk. We waited an hour and the line started getting long. People in line started getting impatient. 30 minutes before the scheduled flight one of your employees showed up, checked in one person, then took the microphone and announced that she needs to go back to the gate because there is a plane coming. She then instructed us to wait until she came back and that the flight will be delayed. So we waited. Me, my husband, our 3 very small and very hungry children and about a hundred other passengers waited in line for over 2 hours to get our bags checked. Needless to say, the flight was already delayed. We finally took off and arrived in Georgia with over an hour delay. Then, we sat on the plane for an additional hour because the captain did not receive information on which gate to go to. It was already 2am and passengers on board were NOT happy, making calls to their family members who came to pick them up at midnight. The captain apologized to us a couple times saying that the airline is not straightforward with him on what's happening. We were finally let off at 2AM. Fast forward 2 weeks, it was time to fly back home. Our flight was scheduled for 7:43AM. Knowing that Atlanta airport is huge, we arrived 2h40 minutes before take off. We went to Frontier service desk exactly 2 hours before take off. This time, there were employees there but the line was massively long because there were 3 domestic Frontier flights leaving at the same time. We went to the self service baggage tag printing machines, printed our tags and stood in the line just to drop bags off. The line was moving very slowly because it turned out that 2 out of 4 employees checking people in were only checking in international flights. So once again we stood in line forever. By the time we got to the front of the line, it was 7AM. As a reminder, the flight was leaving at 7:43. The employee took our IDs, then told us that someone else would take care of us and put us in another line. Turned out that it was too late to check bags (by 2 minutes apparently) so we were going to be rebooked. We missed the flight ONLY because the inability of Frontier Airlines to provide enough staff to check passengers in in a timely manner. Just as a side note, we were already checked in, paid for bags AND printed tags. We arrived at the airport more than 2 hours before scheduled flight and we did everything we could ahead of time. The only responsibility of Frontier Airlines staff was to physically take our bags and put them on the belt. Going back to our airport experience, we were put in line to ""rebook"". Stood in this line for over an hour together with numerous passengers who also missed their flights because of the lack of competency of Frontier Airlines' employees. They wouldn't refund us, wouldn't let us talk to the supervisor and offered us NO solutions. We ended up eating the cost, renting a car and driving for 18 hours.. Don't fly Frontier. Just don't."

The one lady asked “I guess it was her supervisor” are we charging him? I turned around and the supervisor was rubbing her thumb against her fingers as if saying “yes get the money”. Anyway this is my first flight so I’m thinking whatever I’m going to check something off of my bucket list. Gets on the flight someone is in my assigned seat. After negotiating for a little under 5 minutes I was able to retrieve my seat. Trip was not that bad for my first time although seats were hard and passengers were elbow to elbow (literally).

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Austin,August 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is the first and last time I will use Frontier Airlines. I've been in a car accident recently and am temporarily unable to get around on my own. To help make things easier, I checked a bag instead of trying to wheelchair and crutch around with a heavy carry on. My flight was early morning (6AM departure) so I called frontier the night before for assistance and was assured multiple times I would have help at the airport in Denver to have access to a wheelchair and someone to help me get around. When I arrived that morning, I had no assistance from walking into the airport to getting to the gate from Frontier. Additionally, I had to find my own wheelchair as no one was at the station to help me and had to rely on other frontier customers to help move my baggage through the checkline while attempting to find this wheelchair (all the ones sitting out were locked and no one there to get them out for me). Frontier had no one available or planned ahead to help me push my baggage, to push my wheelchair to get me around, or to move me through TSA and to get to my gate, which Denver requires a train to get to gates and is a longer route than other airports. I was told I had to wait for help which they didn’t have anyone at the time and watch my timeline go down when it was 4:50AM at this point with a 5:20AM board time. I asked for help from the luggage line associate, the baggage check associate, and from random workers throughout the airport- everyone looked at me in a wheelchair struggling to get around and said ""Sorry, I can't help you"". I even overheard someone working with luggage complain about being asked to help me when they had luggage to get on planes at the check baggage area. To avoid being late, I started the path and elevator ride down to TSA on my own after informing the Frontier baggage associate I would like someone to catch up with me. She looked at me and said nothing and went back to her job. Once down the elevator, I was clearly lost and distraught as a TSA officer asked if I needed help when I got off the elevator and was looking around. It was emotionally distressful to have multiple people both with frontier and at the airport look at me and offer no help or tell me they couldn’t help when asked. I called Frontier to pursue a reimbursement of my return flight due to the experience and they offered me a $20 credit - it was offensive to offer practically nothing for someone who needed help and was assured they would have it. After declining, the offered $50 and I declined again wanting a manager. After discussing my experience with a manager, he said no reimbursement would occur due to the fact that I took the flight still. So the options were to cancel my flight, most likely pay for that cancellation, and reschedule all to have my experience be reimburseable to Frontier. This airline doesn't put their customers first and it was a sad, emotional experience needing help and having my worst fear of not getting assistance occur. I would like my experience to be heard by anyone needing assistance on an early morning or late night flight- don't assume because they tell you help will be there that someone will aid you. If you are disabled, injured, and need assistance, use another airline."

On arrival the people assigned to 2B / 2C were sitting in 2A & 2C. These persons were of a very large size by width and essentially eliminated the middle seat with their size making it impossible for me to take my window seat. Ultimately I ended up being offered the aisle seat #2C but because of the size of these people i was only able to use 2/3 of the seat and the arm rest to separate the seats was well behind the person next to me. I spent the entire flight folded over on myself with this persons entire arm resting on my arm and chest. At times i could feel the perspiration building up between our skins. Not only did i not get the upgraded seat i paid for, I did not even get a full seat. The flight crew did nothing to acknowledge the situation nor did they speak with the two passages to see if they had family members on the flight that would be willing to take the unaccommodating seat I was forced to use. The flight crew merely handed out seat belt extenders to the two passengers while I stood there. It turns out there was family members in the 3 seats across the aisle. One of them should have been asked to take the 2/3 seat I was forced to try and use. I try to fly Frontier when I can and have always been very patient with the flight crews out of sympathy for their situation dealing with a sea of humanity. On exiting the aircraft I did as I always do, Thanked the crew. This was their opportunity to at least thank me for my patience. I got nothing. Not even the recognition of the ""thank you"". Regardless, I paid for a full seat and didn't get one - I paid for an upgraded ""more space"" seat #2A and got less than I would have in row #31. Was I supposed to walk off the plane and hope to get a flight home somehow from some airline? This was their reply: We respect that you are requesting a refund. However, we cannot honor that request as this should have been referred to a Supervisor that was present and able to witness that you did not fit in the seat. In fairness to all customers, the fee for seat selection is non-refundable, the flight was completed the seat you were assigned had the same value as the initial seat purchased, a service was provided, due to our policies we are unable to issue a refund for a seat. An exception will not be granted for this situation. We will not be communicating further on this topic. Thank you for considering Frontier Airlines for your travel needs. Sincerely, Customer Relations Specialist"

So I had paid for a shuttle when I got back and lost out on going home because we missed the shuttle. Then our flight didn’t leave till way later because “computer problems “ and some dude had to be taken off the plane. The whole thing made me and my gf uncomfortable. The flight was choppy and cramped plus you pay 60$ to check in your carry on if not online you pay at the gate 100$ there. Won’t fly with Frontier again.

Not Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix,August 2022,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,4,no,3,  The cost of the flight was reasonable since we only had 1 personal bag each. But they nickel and dime you to death with all the extra fees. The seats are very uncomfortable and not very much leg room. You have to pay for water and a snack. We have always at least gotten a drink. I won't say I wouldn't fly them again but I will try not to if possible.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Phoenix via Denver,September 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  My wife and I just had a baby on August 10th and I got appendicitis procedure done on August 15th so I booked a flight for my mom and brother to come visit and help out. Their Flight got canceled on 19th. A rep named Harvey assisted me that day. He mentioned there is another flight on the 21th told him that’s to long of a wait but he said no other flight so I wasted to be put on the 21st flight then I asked to be transferred to manager. He told me there is a 2-3 hour wait told him I don’t mind then 10 min later he came back and said he can’t complete the transfer and that he is going to cancel the rebooked ticket since I requested for a manager. He said the only way I can rebook the ticket is by canceling my request for manager so I was forced to cancel my request. Wasn’t compensated for our inconvenience. Got put on another flight for 21st of August and today the flight is delayed and I’m concerned that they are going to miss their connection in Denver. This stems from poor management and ownership. I called in to get help got hung up on so at this point don’t know what to do.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Las Vegas,August 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  No notification at all that the flight had been cancelled, we get to the airport then find out Frontier is not in the main Austin terminal, it is on terminal B which is like 10 minutes from the Austin Airport and it is really a second class terminal. We get there and everybody is saying the flight got cancelled, we got to the line, knowing the flight had been canceled and when our turn comes, we are just offered a full refund or a flight the next day close to midnight, so for a 4 day vacation we would have lost already a quarter of our vacation, $200 for the show we had bought and one night of hotel. Later we were told by someone else that they could put us in a flight from DFW 4 hours away, so we tried that option but they said ""but your return flight is still to Austin and we are not going to change that one"", that just made us decide to cancel it and we ended up losing $700 for our AIRBNB and the show. We learned our lesson the hard way. My recommendation, pay more and use a better airline."

The Frontier employees act like they have so much power over you and treat you like vermin. Our personal size luggage, which we fly with every time we fly anywhere, we were told we had to pay for on our way home and we flew frontier (the same airline) to our original destination and there was no problem then. They we so rude that I was just about in tears and I have 5 kids that I am trying to care for as well. Also when your on the plane unless you are buying something they won’t give you the time of day and treat you as a annoyance. I will never fly frontier again. They are a joke of an airline."

At check in bag weigh 44lb. Clerk acted like I committed crime and had to pay extra which I had already paid. At boarding the flight desk person told coworker if carryon bags looked big, send the people to her to pay extra. When customers stated that he was allowed one carryon bag she said if he wanted to board plane he would pay the extra fee. Made women with small dog carrier pay extra also. Then got on the plane I have sat on stadium seats with more padding than this airplane. My butt was numb before we left the terminal. To get a bottle of water was extra. All told my inexpensive flight cost an extra $755 in add on. Will never fly Frontier again."

I will never recommend Frontier Airlines however due to their repeated flight cancellations without notice, and their inability to depart or land on time. Furthermore their credit policy is so bad I am not going to waste words to describe it. A quick look at any of the online airline reviews reveals that Frontier ranks at the bottom among all airlines, and for good reason."

We were not canceling last minute. They are selling our seats twice guaranteed. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Denver to Washington, D.C.",August 2022,1.0,4.0,,,,4.0,1,no,1,"  My flight departed Denver on Sunday night 5 hours late and landed in Washington, D.C. on Monday morning at 3:00 a.m. They don’t even have any charging ports or electrical outlets to charge your laptop or phone. They promote the seats as being light and ergonomic, but what they don’t tell you is how uncomfortable the seat is with limited padding. Frontier may as well just provide you with a 5 gallon plastic bucket to sit on. It couldn’t be any more uncomfortable. The positive part of the flight was that I did receive a free cup of water. Everything else you pay for. You can’t pay for WiFi, because they don’t have it. And then to add insult to injury when we landed in DC a announcement was made on the plane that our luggage would arrive on carousel 4A. While everyone waited patiently at Carousel 4A a airport employee came over and notified us that our luggage came up on Carousel 2A. Carousel 2A was on the other side of a wall and could not be seen from Carousel 4A. Now Frontier Airlines has offered me a $50.00 voucher to be used on my next Frontier flight, but it is only good for 90 days. They can keep the voucher, because there won’t be another Frontier Airlines flight in my future."

So we delayed from last night and supposed to reboard today, at 9am needless to say it’s after 9 and we still are in Vegas. We had to sleep on the floor all night. Not only were we forced to stay on this airline because we was told after the pilot delayed that our checked bags were no longer a priority, yes our bags were on the plane so we had no choice but to sit and wait.

Airport was extremely cold, my daughter was tired and sleepy and was crying a lot. We were supposed to depart at 11:00 am from Orlando, airline pushed it back to 2:00 am. I asked the reason, no body answered. The only answer was, hope that your flight doesn’t get canceled. Very unorganized. I don’t recommend at all. I had horrible experience with 2 kids at the airport. By the way, I forgot to mention that on our way coming from Philadelphia to Orlando, the airplane AC was not working for the first 1 hour. My husband couldn’t breathe. It was extremely hot."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  My review would be zero stars, but it is impossible to leave a zero star review. Frontier has gone completely downhill. On Saturday, August 6, I was scheduled to leave Atlanta at 9:42pm. We ultimately left after 3am on Sunday, August 7. The entire experience was horrible. From the delays that were never explained to the lack of care for the customers. There were many families and children on this flight. Frontier made NO effort to provide water or snacks or items like blankets to make people more comfortable. We didn’t feel like it was prudent to head to the McDonald’s and wait in the 40-minute line because the gate personnel told us to stay close. I will say that the Frontier staff was friendly, but they were not helpful, nor did they show much empathy or compassion. One flight attendant told me “I’m in the same boat as you, I’d like to get airborne”. In fact, she was not “in the same boat”. We were paying customers and she was an employee earning a paycheck. I felt like her comment was a slap in the face. The delays we experienced were not due to weather or any uncontrollable circumstances. For example, why did we sit on the airplane for more than an hour with a combination of no pilots, no air conditioning and a very off-putting smell coming from the HVAC system once it was turned on? Why did we board our final plane so far in advance of our actual departure (about an hour)? We sat in uncomfortable airplane seats for more than double the flight time between Atlanta and Denver. Once we landed in Denver, why did no one call ahead to the concourse to ensure we could deplane with no more delays? Throughout my adult life, I have flown more than 1 million miles. I have experienced delays. I have experienced good customer service. I have NEVER experienced anything as bad as what took place on August 6. Upon walking through the airport in Denver I received a $50 credit email from Frontier. Again, this felt like a slap in the face. We were delayed for more than 5 hours. I’m sure people missed connections and family events and moments in their lives that could not be recovered. $50 is a complete joke. At the very least, Frontier Airlines owes each passenger on that flight no less than the full cost of their round-trip fare. If the passengers were only travelling one direction, you should compensate them with a fully paid round-trip credit. I am hoping this message finds someone that cares about Frontier's customers. I am hoping that the mistakes made on August 6 become learning events for Frontier Airlines and that no one has to experience the very poor service we endured. The photo below was taken 14 minutes prior to our initial departure time."

Flight from Dallas to Ontario and Ontario to Dallas was delayed. Got a delay notice 5 minutes before dropping off bag. They don’t send any updates after the the initial delay Notice and they Don’t let you check in till 2 hours before the flight was delayed. They spam you with emails to pay for checkin fees etc and a 20 minutes sales pitch to sign up for their credit card before landing was just too much."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Denver,August 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Worst experience with any airline I’ve ever had. Frontier cancelled my flight from Pittsburgh to Denver as I was traveling to the airport. Due to my job I had to immediately book a new flight with another airline because frontier didn’t have another flight available same day. I then got an email saying that I was eligible for a reimbursement up to $300 if I chose to go with another airline. Frontier failed to abide by their option provided to me and told me that all they could do is refund me the original price of the ticket purchased with Frontier. How are you going to offer a reimbursement to customers to go to another airline and then not abide by it?

My flight was canceled short notice and the employees were rude and literally said “rebook or refund.” It’s Friday and they said the next flight would be Monday. ALSO, it takes 3-5 business days for a refund. So if I didn’t have any emergency money I would’ve stayed in this airport for 4 days and 3 nights!! Luckily I found another airline but I still had to pay even more so that I can make it home. This was very inconvenient & all the staff is rude! I will make sure I never recommend this airline to anyone. This is the 2nd time the flight was canceled. There needs to be more responsibility and accountability. You never know what someone is going through.  Terrible service, terrible airline."

The only down side was one person kept singing in my ear and loudly when no one wanted to hear her and the women in the window seat kept playing her videos loudly on the plane and everyone kept looking at my aisle. The plane was also late a little bit to philly and over 2 hours late to Palm Beach international..
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Salt Lake City via Denver,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  By far the worst airline experience I have ever had. Every single flight (4 total) on my round trip was delayed. Extremely long layovers on both trips, just to end with a 4 hour delay on my final flight. They didn’t delay the flight until 10pm, and said I would have to wait until 2am before my flight would take off so it was too late to book with any other airports. And this was after I had been waiting over 8 hours for my connecting flight. Had to pay another day for parking and lost my hotel for my destination. The only compensation they offered was either a meal voucher (for restaurants that were all closed) or refund. I opted for the refund and the people at the counter refused to give me my bag. They told me it was already in route to my destination. I had to book a flight with a different airline for the following day which meant I was out an extra $400 for new flight and hotel. Then when I arrived at Salt Lake City the next day to claim my bag, no one was anywhere to be found at the ticket counter or baggage claim. The airport said the frontier doesn’t have employees available until 2 hours before the next flight. They didn’t have another flight for 6 hours. I can literally see my bag through the door an no one on the phone would help me. They kept trying to get me to file a lost bag claim online, I said it’s not lost! I can literally see it. I still have a 3 hour drive to get to after this. Did I mention I paid to check and carry on my bags. It’s 9am and they’re the only airline without any employees available"

Sitting on a hot plane forever with little to no updates of how long we would be there with no wifi was a terrible way to start our trip. The seats also feel like you’re sitting on metal.

Frontier is so hungry for money that they are charging an additional item even if your second item is a food bag or a pillow and it doesn’t fit in your personal item. The gentlemen that was checking people in was rude and inconsiderate. He was barking at people like they were children and was making people pay for things like the food bag they were carrying on if It didn’t fit in their personal item. I was traveling with a pet which means I had paid over 230 for a one way from Miami to San Juan at 6am on August 10th on Flight 118. He did not know the rules and proceeded to yell at me about having to pay for the carry on because the pet meant that I couldn’t place the personal item under the seat - which is why you pay for the pet. This person I’m sure is rewarded for his behavior because I can bet no flights get more money at the gate at 89 per carry on item that they now have to pay to eat on the plane. This is the last time I will be flying with them.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Orlando,July 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I used Frontier Airlines only because it was cheaper and had the dates that worked best for our quick flight to see a friend. Cheaper does not mean better. The seats are super uncomfortable, there are fees for anything and everything extra, no WI-FI, have to pay $3.50 for a bottle of water on flight if you need, super bumpy flights, obnoxious flight attendants, super slow to board and and depart from the plane, etc. If you do fly with them, don’t fall for the you have to pay extra for your seat thing, (you don’t), use the “personal item” only option if you’re not going for a long period of time, (the size limit is big enough to fit a few days of clothes in it), pack snacks and a drink (they’re going to charge you a lot for anything you need during flight), and prepare yourself for a very uncomfortable seat. Overall not a good experience and will stick to our usual Southwest Airlines from now on."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to La Guardia,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  If I could give this airline less than a zero I would. I paid for my luggage, an upgraded seat, and a carry-on bag $350. The staff of this company doesn't communicate. I got to my gate and was told I had to pay an additional $90 just for my purse. To make it even worse the ""staff' allowed stand-by customers to board before wheelchairs and other passengers. No matter what you pay you are not given anything complimentary. This company needs front desk agents that are professional adults.  I and 6 others on the same flight asked why we have to pay extra, the response was they put this into effect a couple of weeks ago. I asked so when customers going to be notified. They said they don't know. When we all asked for a supervisor they said no supervisor was working. The only response they did give was we don't know what to tell you and this is the price and if people don't pay it they can't board the flight. Even though we had already paid. Then a young lady walked around taking pictures of people's boarding passes. Not from a work device, but her cell phone. The flight gets delayed by almost 4hrs. With no announcements made they told us to all de-plane and wait to see if they can let us back on board due to the rain. Once we finally get back on they even have the nerve to charge for travel-size snacks and drinks from $5.25-$14.50. They had no wifi. They wouldn't even give people water. Kids were walking up and down on the flight, screaming, and, crying. They even forced a woman that is not mobile out of her wheelchair. The young kid that was at the front desk is going to say well if she can't get up and get into our chair she can't board the flight. The same staff was sitting around on cell phones when we all had to de-plane, yet again being of no assistance. A few of us asked for wifi, they said they don't have any. There was no flight entertainment for the kids that yelling, screaming, and crying the entire flight.  This airline is by far the worst. If anyone can get a refund and book with another airline run and do it. "

This was the worst experience I have ever had when traveling. My day was going great until I arrived at the Frontier gate. I was greeted by a woman who yelled in my face to get away from her. With my credit card out to willingly pay for an upgrade, I said nothing and retracted. The flight was supposed to be boarding 20 minutes later. We got onto the airplane we sat for an hour before they had us de-board the plane due to our flight not being given priority at Atlanta airport. My flight from Atlanta to Denver was supposed to leave 2 hours after we are. We sat in the terminal everyone on hold with Frontiers customer service. After 1 hour 45 minutes on the phone telling the customer service person that there is a flight that left the next morning I found myself by Googling and that it would not be necessary for me to spend the next 3 days in Atlanta, she corrected my next flight. 12 hours after flying to Atlanta and sleeping in the airport, I went to the attendant at my gate, to be screamed at about how she doesn’t have time for me (once again, credit card in hand, trying to pay for an upgrade) and to go sit down. The flight attendants were very nice. The pilots tried to help those of us who had connecting flights, but the overall experience and amount of time myself and many others had to spend waiting on frontier to get their stuff together was mind blowing. I will never travel with them again."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Long story short. They can never be wrong. Even when they are, they will not make it right. If their associates make you miss your flight they will not give you a refund or a voucher. What I mean by that is this, I arrive at the airport 2 hrs and 5 min before my flight. Their associates make me stand in the wrong line for 90 minutes then me moved me to another line (still the wrong line). I didn't get to the counter until 20 minutes before my flight. I was sent to rebooking and I was given a flight I couldn't use. I took the flight because their associates told me I had to or I had no chance of refund or a voucher. Of course, now their using that against me saying oh you booked another flight there's nothing we can do! I'm emailing this person from Frontier telling him all of this and not only will he not admit any wrong doing he's pointing fingers at me, like arriving 2 hours and 5 minutes before a flight is the wrong thing to do! Frontier! You have a checklist you ask passengers to abide by? What if, hear me out, someone abides by that checklist, then your employees mishandled them and causes them to miss the flight. Totally the passengers fault right? Because they only hire pristine professionals that can do no wrong so obviously the passengers are the problem yeah? "

They offered to fly us to the nearest city instead, but offered no accommodations for getting to our actual destination. They said they could just cancel our trip and get a refund, but we already took off work it was for my sister's engagement that we did not want to miss. Employee claimed to give us $50 credit for each passenger in our party. On the written statement, it says good for 365 days. The credit was actually only good for 90 days. I never received a digital or printed confirmation of this interaction. When I reached out they admitted to their mistake but said there was nothing could be done about extending the credit despite my evidence of the employee handwriting and my email that indicated no follow up. There seems to be no one actually in charge and the company as a whole very clearly lacks accountability. We lost hundreds of dollars due to travel changes and got nothing in return."

I miss my flight, my time and also the staff trying to tell me to show me the cams to “proved that I was in the wrong but when I told them to show the “prove” the I was in the wrong they didn’t do nothing about it just to make me leave. I can’t even do my check in because nobody and no staff to help me. I only have a backpack I didn’t have to go to the bagging area just print my boarding pass and manager making me excuses telling me shes doing me a favor to stay there to “help me” and charge to rebook my flight. Putting the blame on me and tell me to be there 2-3 hours more when in other airlines company’s for a backpack I can do my self check in minutes and go to the gates or even if I can’t do it is staff there yo help me with the boarding ticket process.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Cleveland,August 2022,3.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Today the kiosk malfunctioned for my bag and instead of offering assistance or a short cut in line since it was an early flight - I was forced to wait in a long line that resulted in me missing my flight. I was given a new flight with of course a 100 dollar charge and a forced charge for a seat of 26 dollars. I now have to travel all day and will be missing a day of my vacation. To top it off the agents were incredibly rude to me bc my luck it was the agent that refused assistance and made me wait in line that checked my bag in for the new flight. When I overheard the couple in front of me also had the baggage kiosk malfunction- I realized it was wrong of them to charge me for their faulty equipment. Lucky for the couple in front of me there wasn’t a long line then and they were still able to get on their flight. I called customer service to get a refund and it was refused. I like this flight it’s cheap way home but my treatment today makes me just want to pay the extra money and fly United. I literally told the front agent I wished to stop our conversation but instead he decided to berate me further. They have new times at their front desk but in April it wasn’t open until 3:45 so I didn’t give myself the usual cushion bc the front desk wasn’t open to check my bag last time. All in all I can’t believe my poor treatment and their faulty equipment. Hopefully the plane works today!

Website is the worst ever. It is slow and not user friendly. They charge way too much for 1 carry on. My carry on weight 12 pounds and they didn’t even weigh it. They charge me $89. Then you pick you seat they show you that if you pick the front seat and pay more you get more leg room. Not true I pay an extra $61. I got the same leg room as everyone else. That’s an extra $150. for a ticket that costs me $79. I will never fly this airline again. You will be disappointed.

I knew Frontier had a bad reputation for price gouge on bags, terrible customer service and unreliability and it seems they didn't disappoint. I paid an extra $250 for my girlfriend an I to have checked bags, carry on and ""premium"" seats. The Seats: The seats they claim give you an extra 8 inches are worthless. They are about the same as the rest of crammed seats on the plane and if you sit in the very front row you'll discover you have less legroom and personal storage then anyone on the plane. Checked Bags: Frontier does price gauge like crazy for those checked bags. As mentioned I paid for a bundle do that included my checked bags. Which came about to around $250 for 2 people. Well what they don't tell you is if your bag is over the 40lbs limit you have to pay an extra $50. For a single pound! But that's not even the worst part. We had a layover in Vegas and they misplaced our luggage. When talked too baggage services an they, ""This happens all the time"". So we filed a claim and they guaranteed us our bags would be back next day. The following day, they contacted us and told us that they received our bags and said we needed to be there before 11 o'clock to pick them up. And I arrive at 10:15 to pick up the bags and the ones in the baggage claim area. So we go to the check-in ticket stand to ask for assistance. The single employee Who is visible that works for frontier says ""well you guys are just gonna have to wait til 11"". At this point I almost lost it, because I was understanding of the system with it not being the employees fault. But clearly they don't care. I can visually see my bags in the baggage claim area and they're telling me I have to wait longer after they messed up. So my friend and I waited an extra 45 minutes to collect the bags that they misplaced. And of course they didn't shop back up to the baggage claim area on time. So I walked back to the checked bag area where there are literally eight employees standing around. When I asked them if they can assist me getting my bags two of them gave me dirty looks. And said you have to wait for the lady to go to the baggage claim area to do it because They were too busy. I'm so happy we paid the extra $300 for them to manage our bags. By the way you'll also see just help busy they were when I asked him to help me in the pictures that I post.. Clearly they were having an emergency that they couldn't help one customer. Do not fly this airline, their customer service is terrible, they will lose your bags, and they overprice on basic services"

Firstly the check bag policy is ridiculous. I had to check my daughter who is 10 small bag she totes her toys in for $69 going and $79 coming back not including my other 8 bags (family vacation). The return flight was supposed to depart at 9:44am it was delayed 5 hours without any warning. It is the most miserable experience I have ever had with an airline. We are a family of 9 travelers with 1 in a wheelchair. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. It may be cheaper but you truly get what you pay for. Instead of relaxing until check out at our resort, we get to sleep and be cold and uncomfortable at the airport."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Las Vegas,July 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Frontier - Customer service is awful. Unhelpful. To speak to a customer rep we need to pay. Advertised for a cheap price. Price of ticket is 225 plus seats is 70 plus. Baggage - minimum - one carry on and one check in - approx. 100. So minimum they cost $400 per ticket from SFO to Las Vegas and back. Customer service is awful. Onboard service is awful. Seats are very congested. Never fly with them again. Racket offer a package of $400 which includes 1 checked baggage, pre boarding, 1 carry on bag, cancellation possible, change possible, better seats - do we need to spend $600 plus to travel from Las Vegas to SFO just 400 miles (to and from). Avoid."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,July 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I will never fly Frontier again. What’s sad is that this is one of the most eco friendly airlines but I cannot support their business and will be vocal to all my friends about my experiences on this airlines. Our A/C was broken, the flight time was changed 3 times, we were loaded on the plane only to sit there without AC mid summer for two hours. While waiting, the flight attendant mentioned the 3rd engine was broken (don’t say this even if it doesn’t effect flight - it just sounds bad), and that they didn’t have enough fuel to get us to our destination. It took one hour to get fuel. The employees were rude with no prompt for such reactive responses. And although the baseline ticket prices were cheap, in the end it’s never worth it. Not only will you get experiences like this but for every bag it’s $40-$80 unless you bring a backpack on, $30 to buy your seat, and $20 if you want to board early. I hope Frontier or access to eco friendly airlines change one day, but until it does, don’t fly Frontier. Especially if you’re on vacation. It’s just not worth it to start or end vacation this way. It costs the same to have a significantly better and more peaceful experience with another airline."

We already was late boarding but if I would have known that I would have held up my flight to get them to note my reservation so I could get my money back from this airline.  Unless this is all you can afford or are in a jam and need to get somewhere. But if you are in a jam and have to use this airline I recommend that you don't pay for your seat cause they may change it without asking you and then the boarding agent will lie to you so this  airline can keep your money.

No one at the counter, the delta guy knocked on the door the Frontier agent came out, knows nothing and says the next flight is at 3pm but not from Orlando! So no one knows anything.

I can’t even use the membership!! I get the membership specific for this trip. If this is weather conditions or I have to change the reservation, I understand it is non refundable.

We booked a same day flight to leave DFW at 6 pm - delay after delay after delay. We didn't end up leaving until after midnight. We were delayed at the gate where the agents yelled at us all like children as opposed to calmly communicating to the group of exhausted and confused individuals. We learned that we had purchased tickets to a flight that had no crew and no plane reserved for it. HOW how how do you book people on a flight that you dont even have a plane for. The flight was terrible and uncomfortable, the seats are just a slight step up from a high school football bleacher. Yes, we had drinks and a snack mix but the whole situation was just ridiculous. We were offered a voucher of $50 each that had to be used by the same person within 90 days - completely unacceptable. We were delayed for over 6 hours, and what is my 11 year old going to do with a $50 voucher, not to mention, none of us have any intention of flying Frontier again. I have been in contact via email of late trying to get them to take the vouchers back and simply give me that $150 back on my cc - I'm not expecting anything great considering the responses I've gotten from their customer service team thusly ... but I'm not giving up.

Frontier Airlines didn't care one bit about this situation they created by the 2 hour delayed. The flight  attendant on board assured us that our connection flight 66 would wait for us since it was also a Frontier flight. But it didn't, it left on time as we were trying to find out where it was by gate number. They don't care about what this has cost people in time and money.  I will never fly Frontier again."

We didn't get to check into out room until 3:30 am. i tried to file a complaint with Frontier and after waiting on hold for a good 45 minutes was told it needed to be done online. A month later someone finally responded with, ""I'm sorry your bags got delayed."" ""I'm sorry you had to wait on the plane for an hour after it landed."" ""I'm sorry your bags got stuck for almost 2 hours delaying your room check in."" I then filed a complaint with the BBB and it took them another month to respond.

Not only does this airline not work on one accord, they can’t fix a simple problem. If I wanted to scam Why would I only tell them about ONE carryon. I will never fly with this airline again. The lack of customer service is disappointing. After paying $477 they can’t refund me $67? It’s not worth it. Plus no snacks. Just fly with airlines that value customers over money.

Noted, I gave them a 6 day notice, plenty of time to fill up my seat. They didn't even offer me a a partial refund. No more Frontier Airline bookings from me."

The day of they canceled my flight sending an email around 6 in the morning (my flight left around 10). They offered compensation for a new flight but didn’t even pay for the full amount, forcing me to pay more just to get another flight after they canceled on me. I bought insurance and they seemed to be no help either in helping, what’s the point in even paying?"

We bought direct flights and they changed them to ones with stops, the seats are as hard as a rock and they have no entertainment. I wouldn’t ever recommend Frontier Airlines."

Apparently, after waiting on line to check in for an hour after our original flight got bumped 4 hours out, we were told we couldn't check in until 2 hrs before the flight. This was post nowhere online or near check in. After stating that to the check in attendants, they said ""we don't manage the website/info"" then called for the next in line. So after hanging in the airport for hours for a flight they bumped out 4 hours, I got to get on line for another hour to check in again in which they decided to take a break and not decide to do any work until 20 mins in. I know I'm not the only ones there since all the other customers were expressing the same opinions. We will never use Frontier or Spirit airlines again. This is a mistake I will never repeat."

I got the airport 1 hour before the flight, there was only 1 working kiosk to check in baggage. After waiting 15 mins for my turn the kiosk stated it too late to check in by 1 min and to see an agent at the counter. Wait in another long line for 15 mins just so a rude agent can tell me that I’m 30mins late and I have to pay $99 to rebook. When I ask when is the next flight I’m told they couldn’t give me that information at the moment and I must stand to the side while the check in others. I asked for a manager, I was told it could take 4 hours for a manager. I missed the flight and had to book with another carrier. Worst checkin experience ever. I was treated as if I did not pay for my ticket."

We all were there 3 hrs ahead but by time some of us made it to the counter our gate was closed and they wouldn't let us board. They didn't accommodate with vouchers for taxis or rooms and pretty much forced you to buy a new tix home. 6 of us missed our flights. I called CS twice saying they made us miss it and they didn't apologize or try to make up for it. I paid an extra $266 to take a damn layover in PHL to get to Atlanta from Cancun. A 2.5 hr flight took 8 hrs! Never again will I buy from Frontier!

There is no strong ethics on this airline. All they want to do is take your money and drop your bags off at your destination. Uncomfortable seats with an uncomfortably fully blasted air conditioning unit set very low to get you shivering. My family and I had our plane booked ready to go for 3:30 PM June 19th, 2022.  We were “delayed” many times for countless reasons. Having the people guess what is going on. “Are we really getting home tonight?” “Should I book another flight?” This is not something one wants to do on vacation. But that’s okay, Frontier Airlines will make you know they don’t care what you do. They might compensate you a $15 gift card instead of a slap in the face. But, whatever you prefer. I have a train to get tomorrow morning at 6:00 AM leaving out of Baltimore. Frontier Airlines does not seem to think others have anything else going on besides their airlines flights i’m assuming. Who lets a group of people waiting to board an airplane wait 5-8 hours with no real compensation?  No empathy throughout the workers on the boarding line. Just deal with it and move on type of attitude. Never again will I fly with Frontier Airlines. Hands down, the worst airline I have flown on."

Had to wait for flight attendant to arrive. Then had to wait for “SO” to arrive after all passengers had been seated. Sat and waited on the plane at the gate. No USB chargers on plane. Trays about the size of 2 decks of playing cards -worthless. Nickel & dime you on luggage and carry on items. Seats feel like you are sitting on bricks. Air conditioning on too high, no blankets available. You end up spending about the same as other carriers when you add up all of the charges. Used to be a decent airline. Not so much anymore."

Landed around 4.40 but couldn’t get off the plane until after 6.30, then we’re told all our luggage was put on a flight to Florida and to talk with the representative at baggage claim. When we got to baggage claim we were told no one from Frontier was there to assist us and to call and file a claim. Called to file and claim and was told to go online and file. So have just finally gotten my claim filed yet still have no idea when I’ll receive all my belongings. Horrible end to a beautiful vacation!"

This time it was me and 7 passengers. They cancelled the flight about 4 hours before it was to depart. I was forced to spend 3 times as much to divert to another airport to get where I needed to go and incur many other expenses. They sent me $50 vouchers per person and apparently thought that was the end of it. That didn't even meet the original ticket price and they didn't refund my original purchase on my credit card. My least favorite part of Frontier is calling their customer service as it is impossible to understand them without having them repeat themselves many times, I was also disconnected from them twice and kept on hold as long as 30 minutes per call. My problem of a refund is still unresolved and that seems to be very typical of Frontier. I am a member of their 100k club (elite in the Frontier world) so I can only imagine everyone else gets the same treatment or worse."

I had a four hour layover in Chicago (Midway airport) and then I landed in Atlanta airport at 1:00pm on 05/31/22 only to find out that my bag was not at the carousel. I proceeded to Frontier baggage desk to speak with a representative who assured me that all bags had been pulled and she did not see a black bag with gold trim. She had me complete a paper claim form for Frontier, and when I completed I asked for a claim number. She responded by saying that she has to wait four hours before she can file an official claim. (I later found out that was a lie, because it says on the document that I filled out to file claim within 60 minutes). I spoke with Chicago Frontier the next day (06/01) who exclaimed that they had possession of my bag, and it would be on a flight to Atlanta that afternoon at 8pm. By 8pm I hadn't heard from anyone at the Atlanta airport and the phones were not being answered. So I went to the airport (wasting gas) to check to see if my bag was in their office from the flight, and to my surprise it was not. I called Chicago back only to find out that the lady who promised me a refund and said she'd get my bag on flight was from 1st shift and 2nd shift did not follow instructions. The lady in Chicago assured us (me and ATL Frontier rep) that she was taking the bag to the next flight now. Unfortunately the next flight that would reach Atlanta would fly to Vegas first and then Atlanta by 5am. I did not hear anything from Atlanta the next day, so instead of wasting gas and paying for parking, I called them back. No bag! Fast forward: Here we are 17 days later from my landing in Atlanta and no one knows where my luggage is, nor does anyone have the decency and professionalism enough to even pick up the phone and update me on attempts to locate my bag with all of my belongings in it."

Our bags were sent on that flight and we were unable to rebook another flight until tomorrow morning at the same time. There was a dozen people who were not allowed to board 1/2 an hour prior to departure, and the flight was listed as delayed! One couple that was turned away were going to Tampa to board a cruise ship. Their luggage was on the same flight that that ours was. From the 2.00 am start to finish, Frontier Airlines has demonstrated that they do not value their customers nor their customer’s time! I have never seen such an inept group of rude, and uninformed airline staff in my life! Every question we asked was met with I don’t know, one whole vacation day wasted!

When I finally was able to reach a Frontier Airlines customer service representative, I was told that my flight was cancelled ""due to maintenance."" I was handed a piece of paper explaining my options - but Frontier Airlines provided no options. I was forced to scramble to arrange another flight with another airline.

There was no apology and no offer to accommodate us in any way but to refund our ticket cost. We were stranded over 2000 miles from home and had to pay $500 to another airline , $200 for a hotel room and $50 for an Uber from Ft Lauderdale to Miami for a flight the next day.

We had no choice other than to accept their offer of a later flight at another date and time to another destination which is four hours away and will have to gain transportation to pick up our parked vehicle at the other airport. They did offer to refund in 7-10 days but they took my money instantly. Where would we stay and eat? Travelocity which is owned by Expedia is just as poor. Failed to offer any assistance. As a result they will not be getting anymore of my annual business, nor my friends or family and they will never gain a positive review from this customer. "

No option to cancel flight/change schedule online, forced to spend an hour on hold. Customer service rep tried to charge $35 for phone support. No recourse for customers. Airline changed passenger name on ticket to a misspelled version, previous confirmation email had correct spelling, thus proving it was the fault of the airline.

In the meantime they gave our seats that I paid extra for away and split us up for our flight, the flight was over an hour late leaving while they were shuffling people around.

No flights available the next day back to Trenton where our car was, so we opted for the choice of booking another airline and flying into EWR. We then had to rent a car to get back to TTN and there was an additional day of parking lot we had to pay for. We were told we would receive a refund in 4-6 weeks, why it takes that long when they can certainly charge our credit card so quickly is beyond me. We finally received a refund but it took 11 weeks.  We will never fly this airline again. The seats do not recline, service onboard terrible and the boarding area much like a bus depot. You get what you pay for."

I notified the flight attendant, she told me to tell the gate agent. I notified the gate agent, they did nothing. They said there will be an internal investigation, but did not provide me with case number or follow up phone number, nothing. I pointed out the passenger to both of these people as he deplaned, neither Frontier team member attempted to stop the passenger to investigate. I was told to call the Vegas office I wanted them to call the airport police, but Frontier did nothing. The other passenger disappeared. It blew me away that not one team member knew how to navigate this situation and just kicked the can down the road. I also went to the frontier luggage clerk and she replied to my issue by saying “carousel 23”. After I explained the situation again, she said ‘I’m just the luggage clerk’. I fly dozens of trips per year on other airlines I am confident they would have helped me differently. This is unacceptable. It’s amazing that after approaching three different Frontier team members, not one intervened, took hold of this situation, and/or addressed it.

I was finally told my tickets would have to be canceled as Frontier had no other options for me. Their customer service is horrible and frustrating.

My flight has been delayed for more than 2 hours and we did not get any compensation. Additionally, instead of providing compensation, the staff with its horrible service troubled me as I was only carrying one personal item and since they wanted money, they were forcing me to pay the price of a carry-on.

First, the correct destination was not displayed at the gate and no one had the courtesy to change the destination to the correct one and staff were hiding behind the counter away from passengers not wanting to answer questions. Second, the flight was delayed from 7pm-9.20 pm then from 9.20pm-12.47 am until it was ultimately canceled with no details as to why it was canceled. The only directions we were given was go to the ticket counter to get a refund and try to find your bags at the carousel. No one knew where to go, no staff knew which carousel the checked bags would be at and no cash refunds were given after standing in line for 1 1/2 hours. No staff at the ticket counters knew how to help, pretty much just said I’m sorry I don’t know what to do for you. No hotels were covered and the best they could say was ""the next flight out is on the 30th of May...4 days from now"". If you want a smooth flight with competent staff do not fly Frontier Airlines."

The staff greeting us at the gate were difficult to understand and extremely unpleasant to all those boarding. Due to maintenance issues, our flight was delayed for an hour. The communication was incredibly difficult from the staff and many people were confused and frustrated. Not only that, but this flight was severely bumpy— I’m not normally afraid of flying, I fly all the time— but this airline had me scared for my life the majority of the flight. I recommend not ever flying with this airline. Not only was the service horrendous, the flying concerning, the seating uncomfortable and stuffy, the pilot wouldn’t stop promoting their credit card promotion over the speakers. Incredibly annoying and certainly not comforting. And once we landed, we didn’t arrive at our gate for over 30 minutes.

My husband had to go to work the next day and I’m begging to get on the plane. Someone else wrote you get what you pay for and with this airline its true.

The third call was disconnected by Frontier. On the fourth call, I finally got to speak to a human. She kept telling me, “You need to understand…” No. Frontier needs to understand. Frontier messed up. I did not. Frontier has not had the decency to respond to me. I received an email flight verification 47.5 hours after I landed at PDX. I received an email offering free flights for mom. Book by May 8. I got it on May 11. In a survey request I responded to, I said their customer service is appalling. That isn’t true. Their customer service isn’t that good. It’s non-existent. I believe they should compensate me for the inconvenience, hassle, rudeness and stress their ineptitude caused me.

I informed the gentleman on the phone that I was not informed of a cancellation fee when I booked the flights and would be calling my credit card company. He hung up the phone on me. I called back and was transferred to someone (without being informed the call was being transferred to someone else). This person told me the same thing. I informed her that I checked the website and it said that I could cancel within 24 hours without a fee. She hung up on me as well. I called back and someone picked the phone up without saying anything hung up (they must have caller ID) so I called from my house phone. This agent seemed nice, but said he couldn’t find my reservation with the confirmation number. I ended up going to their website and cancelling the flight (no cancellation fee).

I had booked an economy flight off Hopper for $126 originally out of OKC, 1 day prior to my trip, the flight is cancelled. I search again and a flight at the same time as the one I had before was posted for significantly increased fare, like $310. So I decided to drive down to DFW for cheaper tickets. And then I realized how they rope you in. The base fare of a ticket is really cheap and catches your eye. Reality soon kicks in as you have to pay for carry-ons back and forth instead of a one time purchase. I understand checked baggage but why the back and forth price. When it’s all said and done, your payment will be at least 3-4 times what you thought you were going to pay for a flight that honestly isn’t that good. In flight, refreshments require payment. They push their credit card extremely hard as well. The plane seats were pretty uncomfortable. Flying back to Dallas from Vegas, our flight got delayed 3 hours. They do keep you updated at least. The app is honestly a star, which was surprising. All in all, would I fly Frontier again? A big no! The predatory pricing for a flight that really kinda sucks is not my thing. You are better paying for a slightly more expensive ticket from Delta and having a good experience. Yes the prices look great at first, but trust me their add on prices quickly make you double take."

Half of my flight were exhausted passengers whose flight got delayed for hours before finally getting cancelled the night before around 1am. We were supposed to take off at 10am and at 4pm they finally cancelled it after we on boarded and off boarded twice without a single apology. There was a family behind me with two babies and the father calmly asked one of the crew members if he could get any food for his toddler since the extreme delay led to them running out. The crew member was loudly berating this man for being selfish and impatient and we were shocked. It has been over two weeks and I’m still waiting for my refund from them. I called customer service and the person on the other end was so clueless and dismissive that after 30 minutes, he still couldn’t tell me anything about my case. the last thing he said before I hung up in frustration was “you should just wait four more weeks and then call us back.” It is worth it to spend a little more for a reputable airline like Delta. I have flown with them and even in todays climate they pay off."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Cleveland,May 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,4.0,3,yes,7,"  My first time with Frontier, and a reluctant choice because of previous adverse reviews and the limited seat pitch of 29 ins. If I had opted to pay for seat selection, the round trip fare would have been as high as the legacy airline offerings, so I left matters to chance. Middle seat outbound was no joy, aisle seat returning. Flights were on time and I found ground and cabin staff pleasant and seemingly well motivated. The seat contours helped with legroom, but they are hard to endure over +2 hours flying time. The experience was akin to a long ride on a city transit bus. A lot of us oldies were groaning when the time came to deplane."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Burlington,May 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Back in March of this year they changed their bag weight ""policy"" of allowing a 40 pound checked bag, when they used to permit 50. It clearly says 50 pounds on their boarding pass. And after calling and complaining, and trying to get the $50 back for the 6 pounds we were over, yes 6 pounds, they refused to give us the $50 back. They kept mentioning ""policy, policy, policy."" And don't get me started on all the other nonsense we had to deal with with the flight. A mechanical issue, which delayed us 2 HOURS, and then they proceeded to board us even though they had yet to sort out the mechanical issue. So we sat on the airplane for another 2 hours before this was sorted out. Why would an airline board passengers if the mechanical issue had yet to be sorted out? It's too bad! Frontier used to be a great airline back in the day. Now it's an airline that obviously isn't focused on the customer.  Never again, Frontier! Never again! And for those that fly Frontier, beware! By the time they charge you for every  little thing, you would still be further ahead flying with an airline that charges more (and provides better service)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Savanna,May 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We lost $1000 because of a last minute terminal change, staff’s unwillingness to help, and suspicious behavior related to overbooking flights. We arrived at the airport 2hrs earlier around 4pm (the flight was leaving around 6). We sat at gate E10 which was packed and waited. One flight before us, going to Charlotte, North Carolina was running late due to a missing airplane captain. We still sat at gate E10. The screen still read, Savannah, Georgia. It was almost time for our flight to leave. Then the Frontier employee made an offhand remark, saying “Oh, if you’re going to Savannah, Georgia, you need to board at gate E7.” We immediately crossed right over to the waiting area in gate 7 that was empty. I noticed that there was no plane parked at the gate. The screen read “Miami on time” with no sign of Savannah, Georgia. We received a text from my daughter’s boyfriend who was tracking our flight online saying that the plane left at Gate E7 10 mins earlier, and sent a screenshot. We had not seen anyone board the plane the entire time we sat at gate E7. There was another man who had the same problem, and was yelling at the employee, “But they only announced it once! They announced it after the plane left.  The Frontier employee just told him that it was repeated multiple times that the gate changed and it was his fault he missed his flight.  We walked up to the Frontier employee and told her we too only heard the warning once to which she replied, “There’s no way you missed boarding for your flight if you were sitting at the right gate. You must’ve not been sitting at the right spot. I told you all multiple times. You just missed your flight. All I can tell you is to book another flight. There are no more going to Savannah.” She turned her back on us and proceeded to look at her phone. Her coworker told us, “You can rebook at the ticket booth”. We walked to the ticket booth seeking for better help and received none. We were told that “There are no more flights to Savannah. It is your fault you missed the flight.” We’ve never lost this much money before. We will never forget this horrible experience we encountered with Frontier Airlines"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Memphis to Orlando,March 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, This airline is just terrible in quality and service. They are on their last leg and will take your money only to provide you with the worst flight. If you call for customer service you only get individuals with a language barrier spewing policy from a piece of paper. I lost my child on the day I was supposed to depart but had to cancel to go to the hospital. This airlines refuses to refund me any of the 500 cash that I paid and only will give me 90 days to use 200 of it as a credit. Even after explaining my situation of bereavement they refuse to refund me anything after making me provide proof of his death certificate. I refuse to fly Frontier ever again!

I booked 2 tickets well in advance just to have them cancelled after I had arrived at the airport (2-hour drive), with no explanation or attempt to rebook for the same day. I ended up spending 5X the amount to fly that day with another airline because I could not wait for the next day to potentially be cancelled as well. I am now hoping to get my money refunded, mind you, it doesn't even touch the cost of same-day airfare with another carrier that had I booked with them originally instead would have been much less expensive. I do not care how ""cheap"" these flights appear, I will never book with Frontier or any of their merged airlines again! FYI, I frequently book for 6-10 passengers at a time. This is the final straw with Frontier."

With the fees we paid on top of the flight cost $588 for baggage and $288 for our seats. You think they could hire more staff. Then approached to security line and another long wait! Tore the diaper bag apart. Then had to test the liquid (milk) more time. Boarded 10 minutes to spare. We were just notified we had to wait for 20 more passengers from another connecting flight, ) 40 minutes we waited in the cramped seat to take off.

I’ve flown it many times (unfortunately) and hate it. I understand the additional fees and discount tickets; this isn’t about those things. This is about the reliability of the airline.

She said no it needs to be 45 minutes before hand which I have never ever heard of. To reiterate I waiting and was late because of their poor staffing, then paid them for it and had to wait fifteen hours until my next flight.

It all started in DFW, everything was so confusing as the crowd did not know where to get in line. Finally after 45 minutes standing the rude attendant tells us and other that we have to get out of the line and wait till two hours prior to departure to check our bags in. We waited and checked back in and was told our baggage fee is $69. we mentioned that we normally don’t pay as my husband is retiring military, but again was told they don’t honor that. When waiting on the plane the screens keep on showing a different State instead of ATL so we asked and was told that it’s the right gate. We were delayed by over an hour, however nothing showed the delay. There was no communication by the attendants. Just horrible! The flight attendants were in the back of the plane talking loud and having fun, I guess it didn’t bother them there were people on board. This airline is out of control, the workers need to be trained by professionally trained personnel from other airlines on protocols. Never again will I consider Frontier now will I receive to anyone.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,May 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I purchased a flight for $124, it cost me half of that ($60) to bring one suitcase. When I arrived for check-in my baggage was deemed “overweight”, and I was charged and additional $100 in order for my baggage to be boarded on the aircraft, which brought my total to almost $300 to fly. The aircraft was unpleasantly over packed. Not to mention that the seats are as hard as bricks!  Nothing is complimentary, and everything is astronomically priced. After our 3 hour commute to Denver, we were forced to wait on the runway for an additional hour before we could off load the aircraft. We finally got off of the aircraft and made our way to baggage claim, only to find out that my and several passengers baggage were not loaded onto the aircraft. My wife and I called the Green and white airline provider, and were rudely informed that I was the reason that the baggage did not get boarded on the aircraft. I guess this was their attempt at shifting the blame to the customer. I’m in Denver on business without any of my belongings, which means I’m essentially here spending money unnecessarily, because I literally can’t work. I’ve tried calling the number that was given to me 3 times since I left the airport, and 3 times no answer. Save yourself the headache and use another airline, you won’t come out cheaper flying Frontier."

Go to check bag and find out you can only check a bag 2 hours prior to flight, can’t take big bag through security where the lounge is located, so forced to sit outside security and wait 2.5 hours just to check the bag so we can go through security.

I saw it on my bank account statement, they double charge me on the very same day that the 1st ticket was booked. I called to ask about this, they blamed it on the booking company and the booking company said that it was definitely Frontier Airlines that charged the duplicate ticket and according to my bank statement it's coming directly from their denver headquarters so they definitely did it. They argued with me for an hour on the phone refusing to do anything about their mistake, blaming me for it and making me pay for the errors. I would advise all people to never trust most of the booking companies out there and most importantly don't deal with Frontier, they do nothing for customer service."

We then waited in line for 6 hours waiting to speak with frontier customer service where frontier employees were yelling and screaming. We were told in the video frontier would not be helping anyone in line and we are wasting our time waiting. We finally got to the front of line and were advised frontier had no available flights for an additional five days which would have cost us to lose our jobs. We were told we would be reimbursed for our cancelled flight, hotel stays if needed, as well as a flight through another airline. We tried renting a car to drive home but all rental cars for multiple airports were sold out due to cancelled flights. We called dozens of hotels that were all completely booked again due to cancelled flights. We went to every airline trying to find flights and finally found one through united three days later and then booked a hotel. We would have never incurred any of these purchases if it wasnt for frontiers cancelled flight. We filed out reimbursement per our instructions from frontier to find out they would not reimburse the cancelled flight. They would only refund our flight from United airlines for $300 even though it cost us well over that per passenger. And they would not refund our hotel as the airline did not provide us an authorization letter which we would have asked for if we knew it was a thing we needed. No frontier employee ever advised we would need such a document. I spent well over a combined 20+ hours on hold with multiple customer service representatives and managers who not only gave attitude to our situation but also hung up on me several time despite us trying to be extremely calm. We got absolutely no where with frontier and even with their lousy partial refund we are still out over $1500 between uber rides as all rentals cars were sold out, hotel, food, water, etc. Do not ever recommend and will never fly frontier again."

At 7:30 I started calling the customer service number only to be on the line for over an hour. I walked the airport looking for any Frontier gate agent. When I found one she assured me our flight would be arriving at 10:00pm and leaving at 10:35pm. Satisfied with that information I walked back to my gate only to see that time of arrival was now 6:00am on May 2nd. That wasn’t a confirmed flight it was tentative!

My connecting flight was on Jet Blue from Orlando to my final destination. Well my bag never made it to JetBlue even after I had explained at check-in my connecting flight was on Jet Blue. They assured me me it would get there. That did not happen. The bag was left in Orlando because they stated thats as far as it was tagged to go. When I contacted them to find my bag, which is still in Orlando 5 days later, they were blaming me for not doing things correctly. I did what I was supposed to checking my bag and being charged $70. The folks I spoke with wanted me to pick it up in Orlando when I live in another state saying it was on me that it didn't make to my final destination.

The real kicker I had to pay out of pocket, wait to reimburse by check and hope that the menial credit they provided would cover the replacement flight. Surprise, surprise, it didn't. I was told I would also be receiving a travel voucher that would be good for a year, I received a $100 voucher that I found out 3 months too late that it's only good for 90 days. Apparently, there was a bit of miscommunication you have to book the flight within 90 days but you can travel all year. I call Frontier for assistance and I was told there is no assistance."

I arrived over 2 hours early for my flight and was told there was a 30 min delay and my luggage could miss the transfer flight. The rep offered immediately to cancel my flight and refund me - over a 30 min delay? I should have known then to take it and go to another airline while I still had time to make it to my destination for a my sisters baby shower. I didn’t. 4 hours later, long past take off, we are informed light bulbs are working and maintenance is working on the plane. Then subsequently the flight was cancelled. The offer to rebook for 3 days later to my destination by a nonchalant agent was the cherry on top. I missed my sister’s baby shower, her first kid because of this airline’s incompetence. I urge you to stay far away."

We left Cancun on time with 40 passengers onboard and we arrived in Philadelphia 45 minutes ahead of schedule, obviously we had to wait in the air until it was our turn to land but even with all that wait circling around we still landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. I don’t understand what all the negative comments are about from passengers that don’t travel much. They are an ultra low cost airline so go with no expectations and you will not be disappointed. I will fly them again for sure. Good job Frontier!"

Their whole predatory system is built to pull you in for a low airfare purchase, then, they'll switch you to some ungodly red eye, or cancel bookings so that you'll have to pony $$ to fly the next available flight. Their '$0 penalty' for changed flights is bogus. They stick you in a workstream loop, so that you have to accept the changed flight. There is no automated 'refund' email. Then, you call customer service, and no one answers - ever. You have to finally go to their website, cancel your flight (that was changed by them), and then you eat a $95 (or more!) cancellation fee. The workstream loop on their 'refund' page is probably the most sophisticated, and tech savvy evil that I have ever witnessed. It's like being in a nightmarish scene from Dante's Inferno. Again. Do not even think about flying Frontier. Ever. Predatory practices in their UI and their 'automated' refund loop page, and in their overall business model. Makes one sick to the stomach. Also, they aren't BBB accredited, just don't do it, folks."

The seats in front of you are always filthy and the foldable table only will fit a phone and maybe a little cup (also smothered with filth). My friend next to me tried to read the safety information pamphlet and it had vomit on it, and it smelled exactly like so. The seats are so small. The air coming out of the top adjustable mini vents smells like they haven’t changed their filter in years. Their bathroom is 3x disgusting. No toilet papers, paper towels, and it smells horrible. Your journey in this airline will be disgusting and frustrating.

The lady was rude, terrible customer service and then I asked to speak with her manager and I'll be damned if she didn't think she was talking to her 2 yr old daughter. Because Vegas Frontier didn't charge me for carry-ons they made a point to embarrass me along with taking any self dignity I had. I paid $79 ×2 just so I could make my flight.

They told my mom that they were probably at the gate, and weren’t coming back until after the flight left so we got on the phone to talk to customer service to get a refund.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newburgh,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines is so grossly mismanaged and has such flagrant disregard for consumers that it is astonishing to me that they are still permitted to operate. The airline stranded hundreds or passengers at Orlando Airport this morning including myself and my 14 year old  daughter. We all arrived at 4:45AM on time 2 hours before a 6:50 departure having already checked in online and pre-purchased bag check. But there were insufficient staff to handle the bag drop and the line to drop checked bags stretched around the  corner of the terminal for more than 3 hours. As a result, hundreds of people missed their flights and were forced to wait 3 hours TO rebook. After waiting for 3 hours on the rebooking line we were told that we would not be able to get another flight until Tuesday to Syracuse  (3 hours drive from our original destination) so we took a refund and booked another, far more expensive flight tomorrow with a different airline. Frontier Airlines did this to hundreds of people this morning in Orlando. I will never book with them again even if it costs me double. They are an absurd and grossly mismanaged company."

Then their checked luggage has a really low weight limit compared to other airlines. They offer no complimentary beverages, which is whatever, but after you pay for everything else it just feels wrong. Then, they forgot to check our stroller at the gate and left it in the gate of the airport we were leaving. There's no wifi, so if you need that, you don't even have the option here. The flight attendants were rude, and to top it off, the seat my husband was sitting in was covered in gum, ruining his shoes, backpack, and shirt."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Albany,April 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  This is actually the first time I have ever complained about any company on a website, but I have to say that today we experienced the most unjust, disrespectful and uncaring attitude I have ever experienced with any industry.  We bought round trip tickets from Albany to Orlando. The part of the trip in question is the return flight leaving at 2:40 pm today from Orlando to Albany. We had additionally bought the “bundle” package for $550 guaranteeing our seats. We waited at the check in line around 60 min. We received our boarding passes, which did not have a seat assignment, but were told we would receive these at the gate. We then went through security, which took another 60 min or so. We arrived at the gate only to be told that the plane was overbooked and was sold out. We had paid the additional $550 (bundle) to guarantee a seat. The lady at the gate said there was nothing she could do. We then asked for a supervisor who arrived at the gate. She explained there was nothing she could do. My wife was very upset, but not abusive, and was trying to understand how this could happen when we had paid for the seats. The supervisor was very rude to her. My wife would be speaking to her and she would “fake” picking up the phone to avoid her mid sentence. It was very obvious. We asked if our luggage was on the way to Albany and she laughed and said it was and she seemed to enjoy the fact that it was. It seemed to me that she was taking pleasure in that fact because we raised some objections to her. Additionally, we were told we would have to re-book the flight and that we would once again have to wait in line at checking and go through security again. She wandered off with no resolution to our problem. Unfortunately, as we tried to explain to the supervisor and gate agent, I have a medical condition and my meds for it were in those bags on the plane. I have to now rent a car, book a hotel, rent another car (I had to fly everyone to a city 2 hours away), buy clothing and essentials and seek medical care. Somehow this really amused the supervisor because my wife was firm with her at the gate. She really took pleasure in our suffering as retaliation. I really believe that to be the case. I have never been treated so poorly. Never. I would love the opportunity to ask that supervisor what exactly is amusing about any of this? If anyone has suggestions on how to escalate this complaint I would love to hear them.  My hope is that this experience is not representative of how Frontier customers are treated. There is no excuse for it."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Islip,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was the worst flight experience ever in my life. To start off, they directed over 500 people all on different flights to three counters to weigh the bags and check in. Then because the line was so slow, almost everyone in the line lost their flight and had to go to the re booking area, where the next flights would be on Monday or Wednesday, which doesn’t work. Then, after it all, they told us that our flight was doomed to never happen because the plane itself was going under standard operation, meaning that the plane itself was faulty and couldn’t even take off. They told us this after waiting in line for 4 hours in the heat."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Memphis,April 2022,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1," Frontier Fails At Customer Service. My wife and I recently traveled from Orlando to Memphis via Frontier. The website navigation and the purchasing of tickets was straightforward but misleading (they advertise one price but then nickel and dime you to death, but who doesn't these days?). In the ticket purchase process we had additional fees for luggage (who travels without luggage?). We purchased two bags to be checked. Frontier used to have a 50 lb. limit to their luggage. We discovered differently. You will read more about this in a moment. This was our fault - we didn't read the website carefully enough. Ok. I own what is mine to own. When the time came to pack for our trip we managed to get everything in one bag. We arrived at the airport and was shuffled from line to line. We got to the kiosk to drop our bag and was informed that it weighed 49 lb. I thought, ""okay?"" I was then informed that it would be a $50 overweight fee. Understand, we've traveled other airlines before where we were a little over before where we used only one of two bags. In the unfailing logic of customer service these airlines would waive fee due to the unfailing math of ""2 bags paid for"" - ""1 used bag"" = ""1 bag not used."" Any was subsumed in what was paid for. I currently sit on hold to talk with yet a third ""supervisor"" who cannot make $50 decisions for the company. Here is my math - check me: We paid for two bags or 80 lb. of stowage. We used 49 lb of stowage. We were charged an extra $50 for 9 lb. of stowage over forty (even though we paid for 80 lb). In my mind, we did not use 31 lb of stowage for which we paid. Then we were charged an extra $50 for not putting that extra 9 lb that we did use in a separate bag. In the end, with the penalty, I paid for 120 lb of stowage (as best we are able to calculate) I called customer service and after my third supervisor has now hung up on me after I was told ""we do not refund over charges on bags."" If I had only purchased one bag, I would not be here writing. I would be in my office licking my wounds feeling really stupid for doing what I did. It would be a $50 lesson - lesson learned. As it is, I feel a bit like I've been robbed. This does feel very dishonest to me. They may as well robbed me at gun point. That is hyperbolic for sure - they didn't use a gun but rather the threat of not being able to fly. They used their power and position to take $50 from me and then refused to work with me on a resolution by hanging up on me. Buyer Beware! Frontier does not use customer service logic. They apparently use a customer consumption logic. With Frontier you are not a person - you are redefined as a walking dollar bill to be manipulated and leveraged. I've kissed my $50 goodbye. Think carefully before you fly this carrier. Hold your wallet tightly. Avoid them wherever possible."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Albany,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  I had the worst experience ever! They first changed our flight which was no issue then they delayed our flight and texted me that the flight was delayed but when i called the reservation line to confirm they told me the flight was not delayed but in fact it was! Then they cancelled the flight 45 min before we were to take off and offered us only a $600 per person voucher to get home. Mind you this was spring break for the kids and we had three people traveling and no flight was under $5000. They offered no help with any hotels and no assistance with the flight what so ever. I was traveling with a child and they had no regard for the safety and well being of my child or family. I advise anyone traveling to never use Frontier.

It gets worse. On the way back (today), they overbooked and wouldn’t let us board. Frustrating enough as it is, they’re trying to tell us that they will not cover the price of a new flight (which is literally a day later, possibly longer). I am so upset and tired, I can barely function. I overheard from another family (that they also screwed over with overbooking) that they would not give back their luggage with medication in it. Never fly Frontier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Puerto Vallarta,April 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  This is the second time I was screwed by Frontier. Should have learned my lesson the first time. I booked with them because they were the only airline with a direct flight from Vegas to Puerto Vallarta. But on both occasions, they cancelled my flights, both legs of the round trip, with less than 1 week notice. They offered no alternative booking, so I had to scramble for tickets with another airline at the last minute and ended up paying much more than I would have if I had booked a different airline months ago. So, bottom line, you don't save money by booking with this airline. You end up spending more in addition to the added hassles. I also had travel insurance, but it did not cover the added cost of changing airlines. It would only have covered it if I was at the airport on day of travel and got cancelled. "

When I called to try and make a change to my flight a customer service rep was extremely unhelpful and very rude when I explained that their policy which is not listed anywhere on their site to change the name on the ticket. They wanted to charge me the same amount a new ticket cost. How does that even make sense, that’s the stupidest policy I ever heard of. Maybe 15-30$ sure but 75$ just to change a name and then I asked to speak with someone higher up, he put me on hold and then hung up on me. Extremely rude so I am now trying to get a complete refund for my flight."

I waited over 2 hours to talk to a supervisor to get my full refund back as I didn't cancel my flights. Frontier did but they are saying I did it off the website. Why would I book a flight the same day for a different person and cancel my own flight that day I purchased a ticket for my partner? That makes zero sense to me and I know it would to others as well. I have waited for hours on hold and then I get hung up on so I try it again and the same thing happens. I get one representative that says we will put you on a call list and then the person calls me on Easter and they won't call back again. So here I am for the 3rd time trying to talk to a supervisor about my situation and they are not helpful at all. I do not recommend using Frontier Airlines to others due to not having the courtesy to call back and help their customer out. I hope Frontier Airline reads this so they can fix their respect and help their customers not take their money."

Flight from PBI to PHL on Good Friday, we get delayed by an hour, finally board the flight, miss our departure window, they reschedule the flight to Saturday, departing 6am. All the communications were poorly issued and unclear. Nobody knew whether we need new tickets, are we getting an email confirmation, anything. They issued a $50 credit redeemable only on Frontier, barely pays for the gas to get to and from the airport for the day let alone my entire day wasted at the airport. I arrive at 4.30am, there's 300-person line to get new tickets because the old tickets are invalid and online self-service isn't working. The flight's delayed by another hour because it took well over an hour for the two desk attendants to get through the 300-person queue and then delayed again because Frontier didn't have the right equipment to get the plane off the ground. I'm flying back to PHL on Easter Sunday, flight's at 12.30pm, boarding is delayed by 45 minutes because the previous flight landed 45 minutes late. We finally board, the departure is delayed by another 45 minutes because the plane needs to undergo maintenance. All the flights were remarkably bumpy, harsh landings, uncomfortable seats. You might get to your destination, but there's no telling when or in what shape."

I flew from Washington to Orlando from where me and my brother (Active Duty) would take a non-stop Frontier flight to Montego Bay in order to attend my grandmother's funeral. After standing in the check-in line for over 2hrs, and requesting multiple times that they expedite the passengers on our flight because we have been in line for so long and our flight departure was approaching. We were met with nothing but rude and disrespectful behavior. After about 2.5 hrs of standing in line, all the passengers from my flight were removed and we had us join another line in order to reschedule our flights. We stood in this line for over ""6 hrs"" before we were able to speak to someone. We were then presented with the option to fly the next day or the day after that. Given that we needed to be there ASAP we took the next day's flight (layover). We were denied accommodations and had to spend the night in the airport. The next day after starting the Check-in and waiting at the gate. While at the gate there were multiple inquiries about whether or not the flight was delayed and we were continuously told it was on time until it was passed the departure time. The flight was delayed to the point where we would no longer make it to the connecting flight (the flight was later delayed an additional 4 more times). I expressed my concerns and was told multiple times that there was nothing they can do. A flight attendant recommended I find a supervisor but non of the employees knew where to find a Frontier supervisor. I had to check each gate individually I found the supervisor. The supervisor was extremely rude and walked away when I attempted to talk to her. After a few minutes, she told me to wait and she would soon assist me. I stood there for 40 mins and still wasn't assisted, but she then proceeded to help someone before me, after which I approached her again and was taken to her boss and she left immediately. Her boss just walked away and said to call customer service. In the end, I canceled my flight, but our baggage was sent on a flight that I requested it not be on hours prior."

Their cancellation policy was the same amount as the flight cost, all when the website was faulty. I tried to change my flight, but in 1 button it got cancelled.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Punta Cana,April 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  If you are considering booking Frontier, don't to it. It is not worth the hassle. Spend the extra money and book with another respectable airline. We had a great vacation which was completely overshadowed by the incompetencies of this airline. To start things off, we arrive 2.5 hours before our flight from PHL to PUJ. We walk inside and the line to check bags is hundreds of people long. Every other airline had a handful of people in line, frontiers line was about 200 feet long, and then wrapped back again. It was blocking the entrances to all the other airlines and right in front of the entrance doors, so it was essentially a free for all. No employees trying to help manage the line or explain where the line began. We waited approximately an hour and 45 minutes to drop our bags. Everyone in line was late and they were calling specific flights out trying to usher those passengers to the front to check bags. Dozens of people around us missed their flights. The whole thing was an absolute madhouse. By some miracle, we walked up to board our plane right at 7:00am when the doors were supposed to close. Take off was delayed by about a half hour, but luckily we reached our destination close to the planned arrival time. Now for the way home. Where to begin. Well we flew from Punta Cana to PHL, but we had a layover in Orlando. For some reason, the second leg of our trip home was already marked delayed about a month in advance. They pushed it back about an hour. Our experience in Punta Cana was great. More than enough staff. Bag drop was quick and the flight was delayed about 15 minutes but no big deal. Then we arrived in Orlando. Landed and sat in the plane for about 30 minutes with no announcement or anything from Frontier staff. Eventually we got off the plane and wait at baggage claim (we had to claim baggage and take it to the next flight which was odd, but I guess thats how they do it). Apparently thunder storms hit right after we got off the plane, it wasn't even raining when we landed. We wait 3 hours for our bags. We were stuck in this baggage claim area and really couldn't proceed unless we wanted to leave our bags behind. There was no seats or anything. It was miserable. I know the thunderstorms added to this, but I couldn't help but feel Frontier was probably understaffed as well. Even when they announced the runway was marked clear, we waited another 40 minutes for bags. It was so late when we finally got our bags, we couldn't even get any food at the airport because everything was closed. We were hungry and tired and miserable at this point. Next leg of our flight proceeds to get delayed, then delayed again, then again. Initial time was 11:15, it was then pushed back to 12:15 months prior to the flight. Then 12:50am. Then 1:10am. Then 1:33am. then 2:50am. Then 3:50am. Our departure gate also switched multiple times during all this, and there was terrible communication about the whole thing. It was a complete shitshow We finally boarded the plane at 4:00am in the morning. Once everyone boards, they announce that they need to change a tire. We then waited until 4:50am until we eventually take off. By some miracle, the plane lands and we get off and get our bags. Frontier Sucks! We had some bad luck with weather but I can't help but notice it seems they are both terribly understaffed and unorganized as well. Never again. I don't care if they are giving the tickets away."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,January 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Worst airline ever. Do to an emergency we had to cancel our flights. We paid 578 dollars. We canceled 3 months in advance. They are charging us 184.00 for a cancelation fee and giving us 394 dollars for airline credit which expires in 90 days. We obviously can't go or we wouldn't have canceled. Now we are out 578.00. So upsetting that they take advantage of people like that. Life happens and hopefully you all will learn a valuable lesson through our experience.

They gave us boarding passes (4 passengers, my wife, myself, daughter-12yrs, son-2yrs) all 4 seats together in one row (36 C, D, E, F) and we were waiting at the gate then they called us to tell that our seats are rearranged now and all scattered in 4 different rows. We just couldn't believe, how was that possible! We have our boarding passes, 10 minutes to boarding and now they are saying we have different seats.! Our 12 yr old daughter and 2 yr old son will be seating in different rows! I initially thought it was a joke but then I realized they actually sold our seats to others. What a cruel dishonest corporation! I must add another point, their luggage weight restriction is 40 LBs whereas most of the other airlines is 50 LBs. They don't offer any snack or beverages on the flight. Upon arrival to Philadelphia airport, their door was not opening Don't be tempted by their initial cheap fare offer, ultimately you will pay more and suffer more."

Finally at 7 am when I finally got to speak with an agent, she tells me there’s nothing she can do and gave me a piece of paper with the corporate number to request a refund. While I stood in another line, with another airline, I called corporate, only for them to tell me that they couldn’t help me and the agent had to request a refund. Just for me to get a flight out the same day, within a reasonable time might I add, I had to fly another airline and paid an additional $300. I will never fly Frontier again."

As my flight approached I saw an ad come up on Facebook for them and I looked at some of the comments and saw a lot of negative reviews. Needless to say I got nervous. We left Boston headed direct to Cancun on April 2 and our flight was delayed half hour, which is quite normal. The pilots were at the gate for a half hour before they boarded and I was talking to them. They were great guys laughing and joking. Our flight attendants we're great as well. On our return flight April 14 it was a great flight as well. Again we were delayed a few minutes but made up that time in the air and actually landed about 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival. Attendants we're great again. One of them the same from our flight there. I just felt I should give some people some hope since all of these reviews are pretty scary. I'm not doubting that they are true, just wanted to give some people hope, since usually people only take the time for negative reviews. We booked the flights and opted for the prepaid package that allows you a checked bag, carry on and pick your seats. Still cheaper than the other airlines. I'll book again with them."

So now our 4:30pm flight was five hours delayed because they gave our original plane away. So now I get to drive home through the mountains in the middle of the night and get home at 5am instead of 11pm.

What was supposed to be less than a two-hour flight is now over 24 hours with an overnight layover in Denver that we were apparently supposed to pay for the hotel for.

This caused my family to have to travel for over 1 hour from LaGuardia to ISP airport and stay one night at a nearby hotel. After speaking with Frontier Customer Relations, they directed us to request a reimbursement for the Lyft transportation as well as the one-night hotel stay that was forced upon us with no other alternative. The agent stated that no email or letter would be given as Frontier needed to know exactly the amount of the expenses before issuing a refund (or voucher for hotel and taxi/uber/lyft). I specifically asked him how would I prove this to receive the reimbursement and he gave me the step by step in their website. Well, here is the same reply received in 4 emails repeating the request for an ""Authorization letter"" that was never given to me, after I explained myself 4 times: ""We are unable to proceed with the reimbursement process unless there is documentation that you can provide, we apologize but we are unable to honor a phone conversation. The Frontier authorization letter is being provided at the airport by our airport representatives or if not, then who ever you spoke with should have a document in our system for us to proceed with the reimbursement process.""

They don’t offer to refund your money, rather of to credit it towards another flight.

In this post Covid world by now we all know flying is not and will not be the same.  Bottom line, Frontier took me from Philadelphia to Cancun safely and on time. During the safety briefing the crew made it fun, the mask announcement was super funny and everyone got the point we had to leave it on covering our nose and mouth. The crew on this flight was great even tho we left Philadelphia at 6:40AM and usually crew is grumpy in the early morning, this crew was not. The plane was only 4 years old and well kept. If you can upgrade to the extra legroom seats, they also recline. It’s worth the money on flights over 3 hours. I’m not sure what all the negative fuss is about, my first time on Frontier won’t be my last. I don’t expect much from an ultra low cost carrier so for someone that came with no expectations I was super pleased."

When it was our turn they said we couldn’t get on the plane because they couldn’t get any more luggage on that flight and we were still 45 min early which didn’t make any sense and the staff instead of helping us were very rude and not helpful at all so we missed our flight at 7.30 am, we had to get the next connected flight at 10.30am to Orlando and then wait there for 4 hours and then go to Punta Cana, when we got to the plane they didn’t have in the menu any snacks for sale, just orange juice and tequila. We got to Punta Cana at 5pm so I lost the whole day. Something happened when we returned, the flight was delayed, we had to wait in the airport for hours, on top of that they wanted to charge me for my luggage because it had more than 40 pounds which wasn’t true. We got home super late and I was super disappointed. I travel really often and never in my life had any bad experience with any other airline, but this one.

When we got to the desk to check our bags we were told that it was too late to check our bags and that we needed to reschedule our flight. We then had to wait in another hour long line to try to reschedule, and they had no flights that would accommodate us. Customer service was awful! I tried calling the airline before we got to the customer service desk since the line was an hour long, and the lady I spoke with on the phone was very rude and thought I was lying to her about what time we got to the airport and blamed us for missing the flight. The flight that we were supposed to be on ended up getting delayed by an hour, so we could have definitely got on the flight if they would have just checked our bags. Never flying with Frontier again."

I had to catch a flight at 6:15 am and we didn’t even board until 8:20 and then sat on the plane for another hour! This airline wasted at least four hours of my day. The staff did not care whatsoever. They sat around for the longest. And no one seemed to know what was going on. Awful. You really get what you pay for with this airline. I would never recommend this flight. It might be cheap, there’s a reason for that. Save yourself the time and headache of this terrible airline."

We were in Fl due to leave out of Orlando for home in Islip NY. 10pm flight out arriving 12:05am. My son was going to pick us up. Sunday afternoon I got a text saying the flight is delayed until 12:05am. That means that we won't be arriving home until 2:30am-ish, assuming they can find the pilot (he has been 'lost' on previous reviews) and/or they don't decide to delay or cancel the flight. Called Frontier about this, waited on hold an hour and basically was told they are sorry, but nothing they can do. My husband has an important 9am meeting, can't change flights, although until this plane gets up in the air, we aren't sure it won't be delayed or canceled. I asked for my money back so I can try to book on another airline but was told the tickets are non refundable. When I brought up that they are the ones who changed the flight times, apparently it doesn't matter, you are at their mercy. Stay away from this airline! We will never fly with them again and after my family witnessed this, they won't either."

So I arrived to the airport for no reason. I had to purchase new flights with another airline because of the inconvenience. Then my date to travel back. First they were delayed supposedly by 1 hr then it became 2hrs then 3 hrs. They don't care it wasn't even bad weather they were just off schedule. But the worst were the flight attendants. They talk to you like they are paying you to fly with them. They are NOT kid friendly at all. So parents please don't fly with them. And they are not cheap it is gimmick. They charge for carry on or anything at that. No entertainment nothing free. Horrific experience I tell you pay the extra $100 fly Delta or Jetblue. These people suck. They gave $50 for the horrific experience to purchase with them again. I promise I'll be alright they can keep it.

This had me landing at my destination at midnight with a 2 he drive home from the airport. No cancellation options were provided. Seats do not recline. This airlines which makes, the now, midnight flight even more painful. It really just seems like a cheap airlines with an expensive ticket. I fly international and south American airline companies do a better job than Frontier. Poor quality and poor unreliable service for an expensive ticket.

If I could give a zero, I would. Despite getting to our airport 3 hours early, it took over an hour to get up to the ticket counter, then we stood there for over 25 minutes because no one could find the credit we had from a cancelled trip during Covid. We waited and waited. After spending another 45 minutes waiting to get through security, running through the entire airport to the very last gate, the doors were already closed to the plane that was sitting right there. The gate agent was then rude (told us we should've gotten there earlier AND clearly wanted us to not be upset about missing our flight) but ""managed"" to fit us in on a flight the next morning. She wouldn't check any other companies for a flight sooner and gave us an 8 hour layover 5 hours from our final destination. After losing our rental car for the trip but still being charged over $400 for it, missing an entire 24 hours of our quick getaway but still paying for our room at the resort that night, they then lost my luggage on the next flight. I had no beach clothing except my bathing suit (thankfully), no flip flops, no toiletries, nothing! They finally called that they had it and I could drive over an hour to come get it with only 30 hours left of my vacation! Thankfully the baggage claim people at Orlando are reasonable and compassionate, so they just sent it back home for us to get when we got back. The ONLY positive interactions with the company were the baggage claim and flight attendants. We will NEVER fly Frontier again, despite still having some money left in our credit! Terrible!"

So, this is my first time flying with these bastards and my last. I thought I found a last minute deal on a flight back home, but golly was I wrong. Flight was ok. Very uncomfortable, but what do you expect from a $200 flight from Baltimore to Seattle, all the way across the country. The only free amenity offered aboard was a cup of cloudy, warm water. “Want a pack of M&M’s? Sure! $6.” When I landed was when Hell began. They had none of my bags. So I visited customer service at SEATAC, which had a horrendously long line, with only one flustered employee. Waited for an hour, was told my bag will be on the next flight. Ok, then. Called customer service then was instructed to fill out a claim. I did. Nothing. Called at least 30 times before my mother told me I was being too nice and demanded to speak to a supervisor. Right after talking to the supervisor, bags were on the next flight. This is 4 days later, and I am in the military. I told them I had essentials in there to try to hurry them, but it seems that they take their sweet old time delivering my baggage. Never again in my life, thank you. Goodbye."

Even with travel insurance and being told that he could get a refund for his return trip (couldn't get on Frontier that same day to return home) and to call within 24 hours to have a refund. Upon calling well within the 24 hours was then informed that they would charge him a $79.00 cancellation fee but refund $83 and some change in credit towards his next flight. They would not be paying/refunding any part of the baggage fee that was paid for his return trip. This on top of being on hold for over 2.5 hours and being transferred from one person to the next, being hung up on twice and only after I demanded to speak with a supervisor was anything said/done to get to where we were told they could do nothing to refund his paid for the return ticket.

I woke up early, got to the airport, paid for parking, took the shuttle to DIA, checked my email and noticed there was an email from Frontier Airlines saying they had cancelled the flight completely at 3.20 am that morning. There was no explanation given but a $50 voucher given for the “inconvenience”. This didn’t even cover the cost of the flight that had been cancelled. I immediately went to the ticket counter to try to get something squared away and the Frontier representative just confirmed the flight had been cancelled and handed me a printed version of the email I received about the $50 voucher. I had to literally beg her to try to get me on another flight. She finally found a flight for 7 hours later that day to a different destination leaving the 2 hour drive back to my original destination up to me. Needless to say, I missed my friend’s wedding. I then spent the entire day at DIA, only to be treated so poorly by the ticket agent and the manager who came out just to raise her voice at me at my concerns with my carry on bag. I’m not sure where they get the audacity to treat their paying customers like the dirt beneath their feet but for all the times I (and others) have traveled with and supported Frontier during COVID-19, it is absolutely appalling how they treat their customers. Will never travel with again or recommend to anyone."

After this experience with Frontier, I am extremely dissatisfied, appalled, and offended at the “customer service” I personally experienced at the ticket counter. There was an hour and 19-minute delay in our flight, they overbooked the flight, and once I reached the ticket counter, there was an issue with my personal item, and the ticket counter representative explicitly said “I don’t care if you miss your flight, you’re not getting on the plane [until this personal item is addressed]” without even looking me in the eye. She kept interrupting me as I was anxiously trying to explain my predicament and just kept saying “I don’t care if you miss your flight”. After lamenting to another unsatisfied and frustrated customer in line, I finally was able to get on the plane right before they closed the doors. Suffice to say, I will no longer be flying with Frontier, I will be discontinuing my Discount Den Membership, and I will be recommending other airlines that will actually treat me like a human being. I even tried receiving a refund and the customer service representative was no help at all. For all the times I and others have traveled with and supported Frontier during COVID-19, it is absolutely appalling how they treat their customers."

We checked in at the counter to drop off our luggage and get our boarding passes. The clerk asked for our identifications, asked me to place my luggage on the scale and after a minute she gave us our boarding tickets. However, she missed tagging our luggage and forgot to give us a receipt for it, but we didn’t notice this since we are not accustomed to flying. We arrived to Las Vegas and our luggage was missing. I went to the “office” in front of carousel 22 and file a claim report with Frontier's personnel. They mention they were going to call Phoenix to have it transferred and I should expect it on the next flight at 4 pm. Someone will drop it off at your hotel. I thought, “Wow, after all, they do care and have great service”. I was wrong! Wasted a full vacation day, I did all the work to track the luggage by calling the airport directly (Hey, don't waste your time using Frontier's luggage department), Frontier's personnel didn't do anything. They make you feel like they are taking ownership of the problem, trust me, they don't. My luggage ended up on a different airline. Had no clothes for our event that night or for our conferences the next morning. Our luggage got to us the next day, They told us to buy clothing for our events, they would reimburse our purchases. After submitting all the paperwork, receipts, and extra documentation, no one has called us or acknowledged our claim. The only reimbursement they made was the luggage fee you pay before boarding. We lost a day of vacation time, gain some stressful hours and frustration throughout the process. You decide if you fly with them. What do you think I will do?"

There were no other flights available at their airline and others until Saturday evening. The wedding that I spent a lot of money on was on Friday the next day. Frontier would not reimburse me for a flight that I could not use due to the cancellation of their sister company Spirit. They said they would only give me a credit and charge me a $79. Fee for the cancellation. I do not want to ever fly with either one of these airlines ever again. Frontier got me for over $700. during Covid because we were unable to fly. I believe Spirit should refund the people who lost money from their flights because they cancelled not us. They first said it was the weather which we know was a lie. Then it was the pilot. (We watched him board) They won’t refund because they say it was not their doing. Well it sure in hell was not my doing.

People have stated to flight attendants that they will be missing their connecting flights if we do not leave soon (response to them was don’t schedule flights so closely). This is an hour and a half late on the airlines time. I know Spirit will be merging with Frontier due to shortage/several errors on your own part and definitely can see why. I suggest Spirit not merge for all of these reasons. Better to to just sell out any remaining aircraft and fire those who don’t do their work on time. Also, the entrance gate to our flight was having issues opening upon entrance. I was asked by a family if they could take my seat so to not disperse their toddlers, I talked to the mother and said that was fine with me, as my husband stated he was up a further row with an empty seat and I wanted to sit with him. I was quickly snapped at by a flight attendant stating its a full flight so you cannot move. No one showed and I moved anyway. So, no need for the attitude.  Now they are stating that a pilot left and that they are waiting on another one to come fly. So who knows how long that is going to take! This is all on my flight to go home. On my flight here, it was canceled just four hours prior to departure and I quickly had to purchase a ticket from Spirit airlines so that I could make it to here on time. Haven’t be reimbursed for that flight, but I intend to get paid in full, or my husband, an attorney, will be sending them a letter."

We remained at the ticket counter while opting for Frontier's recommended option #2, Reimbursement for Travel on another Airline (we actually tried to rebook with Frontier but they wouldn't let us). Upon re-booking our party of 4 through their recommended rebook.tripeasy.com platform, only 3 confirmations were charged leaving my 12 year old son without a ticket. Again, they refused to even talk to us let alone do anything to try to help us. We rushed over to the United counter where they successfully transferred the name on the ticket and rebooked my husband on a separate flight. We were now on two separate flights to San Jose, Ca. not our original destination of Sacramento which as you can imagine, provides a host of other challenges upon landing. Utilizing Frontier and their recommended rebook service, all of us were booked as adults while their birthdates indicate two passengers are minors. I have called to inquire about the refund and attempt to transfer the credits to an adult name (perhaps the person who booked and paid for the flights) and after being told the representative could not see the refund details, I was put on hold for an hour before the system hung up on me. Minors cannot book or pay for flights, nor do I have any refund information still. I have still been charged for a flight that was cancelled. "

The flight was already cancelled, but no ticket agents available since they don't come out to help until two hours before departure. There was a large group of us just sitting in line for two hours waiting. Once the ticket agents came out they didn't have any other flights I could get on for four days. The ticket agent explained that Frontier would assist in covering some of the cost and there would be three options available. 1. Get a hotel to wait until flight available, 2. Book with another airline 3. Get a rental call. All the details would be in the email that I would be receiving shortly according to them. Since other flights were substantially more expensive I decided to drive home (1000 miles). I obtained the cheapest rental I could and headed home. I never received an email, so I called customer service. I spent almost 2 1/2 hours with customer service being told they could not help me because I didn't have an actual letter from the ticket agent stating they would cover my car rental cost. It cost me almost $500 to drive home with rental fee, gas and Wendy's. I would have been happy to get back half, but Frontier was not willing to do anything. They acted like they were doing me a favor by giving me back my flight expense on a flight they cancelled. If your flight is ever cancelled do not leave the ticket counter without a written agreement from the airline with the options they will cover.

I then drove to my airport in Atlanta to speak with the frontier agents, and no one was in sight. Another family was there crying because they was also on this flight. Also, let's mention I was flying with an 8-month-old. The only flights that was available with a different airline were flights with 2-3 layovers which were not going to be possible with an infant. My family and I then had to spend thousands of dollars to fly with Delta to get us to Orlando before 2 pm. The other half of our family was rescheduled by frontier and cancelled twice this same weekend. This was beyond ridiculous. We were hung up on by a numerous amount of agents that were also very rude to us when not even attempting to help much."

Pilots were the only saving grace in the whole experience for a safe takeoff and landing and expeditious in taxiing. Bag drop at the airport needs a major upgrade, takes way too long. Flight was delayed with no update from the gate attendants, at the very least keep us updated with what is going on. Baggage claim at Baltimore was again poorly organized and took triple the time it takes major airliners. The overall “cheaper” pricing doesn’t get you bags if you’re a civilian, only worth flying Frontier if you’re military. Pay the extra $50 to fly with United, American, or Delta. Pass on Frontier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Tampa,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Today was supposed to be my (and my three kids) first flight with Frontier Airlines. It was a disaster. The aircraft had some mechanical problems. Those things happen. The communication from the staff was nearly non-existent. They showed up at the counter to announce delays (from 4:00 to 4:45 to 5:15 to 5:45 to 6:45 to 7:30 to canceled), stayed for a few minutes and then left. The passengers were generally unaware of what was happening. Naturally a long line formed in front of the counter because folks were changing - or attempting to change – their flight arrangements. No other customer service agents came to relieve the line. An email ended up being sent. The next available flight was not for four more days! Four options were given: 1) Up to $400 credit/traveler for travel with another airline. It’s Spring Break on 12 hours’ notice. $400 does not cover that. Not even close. 2) Full credit for my ticket plus $100. Essentially, the $100 voucher pays to ensure that the passenger does business with Frontier again. With flights as expensive as they are now, $100 is not much. The full refund (see option #4 below) is much more attractive but it’s cash in hand I have no chance of losing to circumstance. 3) Up to $400 total (not per traveler) for alternative transportation. In my case, this would have been a car rental. Between car rental and gas this also does not come close to covering my trip. It is also useless. 4) A full refund which is unfortunately the best and only option. After spending the day at the airport and disappointing drive home I had to look my kids in the eye and tell them that their trip to see their grandparents was canceled. I have never experienced a worse traveling experience than I experienced today and one of the most disappointing experiences in my life. Problems happen. Mistakes happen; we all make them. The true test of character as a person or a business is shown in response to those problems. Frontier’s response to these problems was downright atrocious and that is more telling than anything. I would encourage them to review their policies and ensure that they can meet their customers’ needs in the event where they have issues. I would also encourage them to provide their staff with basic customer service training."

We waited an extra 2 hours to depart that time, missed our shuttle in Cancun and waited more time for that to return for us. The Frontier staff ""forgot"" to bring the immigration forms, so we waited extra time after landing to get those. The flight back was also delayed 2 hours and instead of getting in to Cleveland at 7, we arrived at 9.30. A debacle at the airport in immigration took even longer. While that was not Frontier's fault, it still got us to our car to head home (2.5 hours away) so we made it home by 1 am. Not fun! Frontier has lost us as a customer. I can put up with the fees for everything, since they do offer non stop flights at reasonable rates. I pack light and buy my own snacks after TSA inspection.

Flight 910 from RSW to BUF seemed like there was a possibility that all looked normal. I said ""not possible""! Boarding was delayed due to waiting for flight crew. That was quickly resolved after 15 minutes when the crew decided they should show to the gate. Why should employees be on time? OK, just 15 minutes. Boarding begins and all are onboard. Then the announcement. We do not have a captain! Guess where he is? Miami! All passengers are deplaned and told that the pilot has been put into a limo and is being driven from Miami.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Baltimore,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines is an absolute joke.  My wife has been on a layover for multiple days. Her flight was supposed to land at BWI on Thursday at 630. It is now Sunday at 1224 and they just canceled her flight for the 3rd time. She has been on a plane 3 different times only to be taken off and basically told nothing! We have had to book 2 different hotel rooms at our own expense and looks like we are getting a 3rd. They also charged her for a carry on bag again after we paid for it and they cancelled the flight. She is going to DC because her father passed away and the unnecessary stress this airline has caused us both has only made everything worse. Couldn't be worse. Everyone who works around the airport in any capacity has said to her, ""Oh, you must be with Frontier."" It is literally the joke of the airport."

He took an extra 2 hours before deciding to go. Now I’m in Orlando.

Do not fly Frontier if you want to arrive on time or arrive at all. They cancel more flights than any other airline and will keep you waiting at the airport all day without proper notification. Flight was supposed to leave 11:17 got delayed four times then canceled due to weather? Weather was fine at our airport and destination and in between all morning till 3pm when they decided to cancel due to weather. What a joke run airline. Will not fly ever again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Philadelphia,April 2022,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1,no,2," Jacksonville to Philadelphia. I wish I had read reviews first. Free carry-ons only count as purse or laptop bag, backpacks are an extra fee, and because I had a backpack and a suitcase, that meant I had to check my suitcase and pay for both my backpack carry-on and my checked suitcase. $70 extra dollars. Also, it was a 2 hour flight and they didn't give any refreshments or food. So they charge you more and you get less. I could've flown a better airline for the upcharge I had with Frontier and had accomodations. The staff was friendly enough, but that didn't make up for everything else. I won't fly with Frontier EVER again, especially after reading all of these horror stories from people who had even worse experiences."

We have been asked to change ticket to April 2 - Saturday 2 pm but this flight also cancelled by 1 pm just before departure time. We tried to change ticket but there was no ticket for next 2 days. We have been traveling with 3 children and it was the worst travel experience in our lifetime. It was our first time for Frontier and will never ever choose this airline again.

Worst travel experience I have ever had. Check in staff was incredibly rude and bag can only be 40 pounds now. Flight was already running 20 minutes late then we were told the flight was overbooked by 6 people and that we were not boarding the plane until 6 people gave up their tickets (the next flight they offered was 2 days later for those people). Once we boarded we sat for 45 minutes waiting for luggage to be loaded. Even the pilot had to call and ask what the delay was! At around midnight the morning we were to depart back home we received an email stating our flight was canceled and given no reason for this cancelation. Had to use their site to rebook and we're told we'd be reimbursed in 14 business days for the new tickets we had to purchase. The earliest flight we could book was 2 and a half days later! And we checked 5 airports! It has now been 15 business days and no reimbursement check. When calling to ask where the check was, the woman on the phone was unbelievably rude and when we asked to speak to a manager she hung up on us! After calling back we were told the checks could take another 4 to 6 weeks."

Flight scheduled for departure 4/2/22 at 10:25 am. Delayed 1.5 hours. Plane is at gate, but no first officer is available. 1.5 hours to get the flight going, and they can't get a full crew! Flight is now delayed another 1.5 hours likely just in time for a storm that will ground planes. I will never fly this incompetent airline again."

I have flown with other airlines and they put the strollers in the cabin on the plane once everybody is boarded, not frontier who puts i under the plane. I made a claim, they did replace the bag, but they said the stroller was normal wear and tear. I did not except that answer because it wasn’t normal wear and tear, a scratch here fine, but the entire stroller scratched and things wrapped and missing pieces no that’s not normal. I’ve escalated it up to a supervisor and the supervisor concluded that it was normal wear and tear.  I will never fly with Frontier again."

They charge an unreasonable fee for every carry on and checked bag. The checked bag has to be under 40 lbs. The plane smelt. The flight crew were non existent. The seats are hard and do not recline. There are no TVs, outlets, or USB ports on the plane. They provide no snacks or drinks. Not even water. I will gladly pay double the amount to fly Jetblue or Delta. This airline is good for a flight that lasts less than 1 hour where you don’t need any bags. My back was killing me after being stuck in that terrible seat for 3 hours. Stay away. Far away."

One of my previous flights kept us locked down in the plane for almost 2 hours after we landed. Today, they cancel my only flight home to see my ill grandfather in the hospital and so I can get back to work on Saturday after a 4 week hiatus. They offered me a $50 voucher and a flight 24 hours later like I don’t have anywhere to be and $50 fixes it all. I paid for a decent seat and all the extras and they pull this stunt. Frontier has completely zero regard for their passengers and this will be the last time I ever use them to fly. My car rental now needs to be extended. My home transportation needs to be rescheduled. I now have to screw my place of employment and get coverage for another work shift and tarnish my attendance and reputation because frontier sells tickets to flights that they can’t make happen as a multi million dollar company. Pathetic and unprofessional."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Denver,March 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Terrible. Supposed to board at 9:30 and take off at 10:15. The previous plane was late so we boarded at 11. Once on plane, we sat on the Tarmac for an additional 30 minutes. Very little professionalism through the whole process and staff was unwilling to answer questions about the delays. Multiple times they told people to stop coming to the podium to ask about the delay. This is not the first time this has happened with Frontier, and as if it matters in the grand scheme but I won’t be flying them again. If they were to fairly reimburse for every bad customer experience, they’d go bankrupt."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Las Vegas ,December 2021,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Absolute worst airline! Overbooked my Vegas flight so issued us flight vouchers and we drove home. When I rebooked using the vouchers to go to Alaska - which ended up costing over the voucher amount and more expensive than Delta -with horrible flight times and long layovers. Then Frontier merged with Spirit and cancelled their route to Anchorage completely! So I had to rebook with Delta which is what I should have done in the first place. I asked for the dollar value of the vouchers rather than another voucher and they said no. I guess Denver is my only option for a non stop since you cannot go anywhere without going to Denver first and strolling their airport for 6-12 hours. Lame airline-skip it for anything other than a quick non stop flight (if you can find one)!

Had a 10am flight from Boston to San Juan, get delayed til 11.30am. Ask one of the flight attendants at the gate if we would be leaving soon. She confirmed “yes” the plane is already at the gate we will be boarding at 11am. 10 minutes later they cancel the flight completely and tell us there are no more flights for the day. They didn’t give a reason. You will end up paying more in the long run and they are the rudest people on the planet."

I am a regular travel and shopping around for last minute tickets Frontier was cheap. Tried it and will NEVER BOOK a flight with this carrier again regardless of the price. Landed on time and made us stay in the plane for over 45 minutes. Making rude reminders about masks? We are adults.

Every leg of our flight going and coming had major issues. Pilot no show. Crew no show. Flat tire. Missing plane. Lying customer service that denied our 4 hour delay due to loading and entire flight on a plane with a flat tire, unloading, finding a new plane, start process over. Customer service refused any help with all the major expenses caused by this by saying delay was due to weather - the perfect 70 degree Orlando weather.  I cannot say enough how horrible this airline is. They care zero about the customer or the customer experience. Fly any other airline or drive.

The 4 employees at the gate were rude the lady checking the carry-one was yelling at the top of her lungs being extremely condescending, she said like I already said multiple times for people that don’t listen you don’t get a free carry-on - one personal item and it has to fit. She said I’ll be checking all of them. Pulled many people to the side again rudely and dismissive whenever it was my turn she didn’t even let me ask her about my bag. I told her she was being rude and then she answered I guess you don’t fly that offer.  I asked her for her name and she said I don’t need to give it to you.  So unprofessional."

Leaving me, my boyfriend, 11 month old and 3 year old with no hotel and no transportation (car seats were rented and already turned in). They didn't have another flight until the next day, which was then delayed by 2 hours. I heard my name being called throughout the airport overhead several times and asked frontier employees if they could help me they shushed me and offered zero assistance. Come to find out after waiting 2 hours to retrieve my luggage, my luggage was still in Orlando because they didn't properly secure our flight tag. Luggage contained all me and childrens medication that are needed to take every day. They say we don't have another flight to Columbus until Wednesday. Called Frontier multiple times- they said they won't offer me a refund because we already took the flight. I was offered a 50$ flight voucher. Absolute negligence and poor customer service. Not to mention the flight attendant was rude and aggressive towards people on the plane with children."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun via Minneapolis–Saint Paul,March 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will never fly Frontier again. My trip home from Cancun to Minneapolis was cancelled, along with the flights going to Baltimore, Boston, Denver, Orlando, and LA. They made us stand in line for over 5 hours before giving us any answers, and that was to not provide us with the direct flight we paid for, but rather to put us on a 1-stop trip. What should have been a 4 hour flight turned into 6.5 hours of fly time, with a 7 hour layover in Denver. I can say with 100% confidence that the $100 flight voucher they gave me will either get flushed down the toilet, or hung as a reminder to just spend the extra money on a decent airline. Not to mention that it costs $75 for a checked bag, and $75 for a carry on. You might as well go Delta, at the very least for the peace of mind that you know the flight actually exists. On our flight to Denver from Cancun, we learned that there were 6 extra Frontier Pilots on our flight, whom were capable of flying but did not have a plane to fly. This means that Frontier was not over booking planes, they were not underbooking planes, no- they were booking trips with planes that did not exist. I will never fly with frontier again, I would rather walk."

They delayed the flight three times, and then cancelled it at 715pm. Our whole day was spent in an airport, my boyfriend was supposed to be back to work tonight, and I tomorrow  morning. They tried giving us refund in ""frontier travel vouchers"". That doesn't pay for days I don't have to take off from work.

Yet We Couldn’t check bags in till 6 pm . At 6 pm the line to check in was enormous as only 2 people were working! Luckily we were first and got our bags checked & proceeded to long TSA lines. All in all 7:30 we got thru TSA . Went to gate and there is standing room only in entire frontier wing of about 8 gates. People were stranded from multiple airlines from days before. Luckily we have priority pass lounge access. We went to an overflowing lounge and waited till 8:30. Then 8:45 proceeded to gate, 9:00 pm came and went and Not one announcement about what is happening. Then 10 pm, 10:30 they started boarding, boarding took an hour for some reason. 11:30 pm we taxied out and were told the plane is having “mechanical issues” and needs to return to gate. Waited 45 min to be towed back to gate at which point we are told we can exit plane if we want. No explanation as to what is going on and if flight was being cancelled. We left the plane and considered taking another flight with another airline but they would not remove our luggage from the broken plane. At 12:45 we were told plane needed a jump start by an anonymous worker who said that she personally never flies these planes. All the people who heard this decided not to return to the original broken plane. She offered us a flight at 5 am. We got new tickets and proceeded to another gate. We couldn’t get any sleep as the fixed chair armrests do not allow lying down. Just a filthy floor! Mind you most bathrooms get closed and no water or food is available at this time anywhere. Come 4:30 am I realize our gate destination was changed. We hectically run to an open counter and we were told our new gate which is across the wing and is supposedly already boarding. We run like maniacs no bathroom no water to get on our new flight. Finally we left and passed out sleeping on the plane. When we arrive no one is around to tell us where our baggage is as it left on previous plane. Waited hours to get help. Come 9 am March 27 we get an email from frontier that our flight from previous day is experiencing delays and will be taking off shortly. No words to describe this absolute chaos!"

We fly regularly and due to departure times, needed to fly Frontier. This was our first and absolutely our last time ever flying Frontier. We arrived at the airport at 4:15am, over 2 hours prior to our flight from Orlando to Charlotte, and were “greeted” with a line that was so long it wrapped around the corner, in everyone’s way. NO other airline had this issue at their check-in stations. We stood in line for over an hour which led to us having to literally sprint to the gate. When we finally made it to check our bag, the unfriendly frontier employee informed us that our bag was over 50 pounds, which was insane since it only weighed 27 pounds on the flight there and no additional items were added to our bag. $100 is what it cost (in addition to the already $40 I paid when I checked in online for our bag). Absolutely ridiculous that somehow our bag doubled in weight and the $40 couldn’t be put towards the new fee. I’ve never been on an airline that was so unhelpful, unfriendly, and unorganized!! If this has taught me anything it is to spend the little bit of extra money to fly Delta or American because you pay for what you get with Frontier .. or in our case, didn’t get.

We flew out of Boston on March 18th, all was well only complain with that was that they told us when we got on the plane that there was absolutely no beverages, not even water or ice or any snacks because the plane hadn’t been restocked. Other than that all was fine. We got here at 7pm on March 26th to be ready for boarding at 8:15pm for our 9pm flight. No worries everything was good to go up until we noticed that it was 8:45pm and we haven’t boarded or got any updates. 9pm came around, same thing. Everyone working for frontier was clueless. 945 comes around, we board. Sat there on the plane before even moving until 1030. Started moving, preparing for takeoff only to stop again for another 45 minutes in silence with nobody saying what’s going on other than “thank you for your patience.” We were then told at about 11:15pm that we were heading back to the gate to start deplaning, and eventually got off at about 11:25pm. Currently sitting in the airport with no updates on whether we’ll be getting home tonight or if we should leave the airport. Anytime we ask, it’s just ‘I’m unsure’. Nobody has a clue, not one to complain but this airline sucks and I do not recommend whatsoever."

There was no customer service number to call to try to confirm my minor child's seat in the new flight. So we had to spend over an hour at the Southwest ticket counter to try to get my young child the same flight as us.

We went through 1.5 hour wait to get through TSA and then sit at gait A10 waiting to board our flight at 6:15 am . 6:15 am came and went as we waited on a “ technical “ glitch until 4pm with very little updates from the horrible Frontier staff! At 4pm ( approx. 10 hours later) the  staff shares with us that the airlines oversold our seats and the seats are no longer available. At that point we had the option to get a refund and not take the babes to Florida, or come back( tomorrow ) today at 3am again, go through TSA and be on the plane at 5:15am. We opted to come back today at 3am in order to get our flight at 6am. We got the kids up at 1:45 AM got them in the car headed to Cleveland airport. As we were taking the exit to enter the airport, we get a text that our flight was delayed until 1:30 pm. So now we are at the airport and have to turn around because we were not going to sit at the airport with a 7yr old and 11 months for 10 plus hours. We decide to go get a hotel so we can all get some sleep. Then back to the airport at 8:30 am /through TSA, to have our flight delayed until 4pm today, so try as we may, not to make the kids wait, we sat at the airport from 8 am - 4pm waiting ( 8 hours) to board the plane bound for Orlando, only to be told to deboard the plan as they can’t get us to our destination because the pilot can’t fly more than 12 hours a day. Then why allow 120 people board a plane?  Several families had been waiting 12 - 36 hours just to be told sorry, nothing we can do! The lack of kindness towards the customers was shameful! "

A disaster is a compliment to this disorganized, not accountable and disrespectful airline.

Not Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Cancun ,March 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They may advertise low fares but they'll get you in the end with other costs including, and I kid you not, the cost of a soda, close to $3.50 a can. We booked through Expedia a while back only to have them cancel our direct flight from RDU to Cancun less than a week before the trip. We couldn't cancel our trip because were within the window to cancel reservations at the resort. We would have lost our money. But we were able to re-book our flights for 3 times what we originally paid and this time they added a stop through ATL, and they cancelled that flight the night before we left. We had to look for another flight for at least 2 hours and then had to fly from RDU to Kennedy then to Cancun. We ended up losing a full day. By the way, the flight from RDU to ATL and then Cancun still flew and was on time. We got text notifications. Then on the flight home we found out Frontier didn't offer e-check-in. So when we walked into Cancun Airport, we along with at least 1000 other fliers got to stand in a line for 2 hours and 15 minutes just to check-in and get a boarding pass. We also had to get a negative COVID test before leaving which we did. Frontier never even asked for it. When we left the line, it was even longer than when we arrived. Then our Flight was an hour late landing and when we onboarded, we sat on that plane for over an hour before we even left the Jetway.  The flight attendants were rude and that's putting it mildly. I have a list I keep of things I'll never do again. I added flying with Frontier to that list."

When we arrived to check in our bags the wait was an hour and half wait. Once we got to the counter she said we cant check you in because 40 min wont be long enough to get through tsa. We arrives two hours early and she blames us for not having time. Its not our fault they took so long to check everyone in. Half of the plane missed their flight that day. It was upsetting they wouldn't find us a flight for the same day. They said they wont reimburse for another hotel and car rental. We had to wait till the next morning to fly out. On top of all of this the flight coming to Orlando was an hour late and an hour to take off. The baggage took an hour to receive. We will never take Frontier again.

I will do everything I can to leave a bad review everywhere so nobody wastes their time or money on Frontier and ends up having to pay more with their own money for extra unexpected expenditures like transportation, food, hotel, flights. We waited in line for 4.5hrs, we were not able to check in and get our boarding passes online, waited in line for 4.5 hrs, delayed flight 3 times and canceled flight unexpectedly which left us stranded in Orlando needing to pay for our own transportation, food, hotel and next flights. And now we don’t have a flight home and we’re having to use other airlines. Nobody spoke English, they changed our gate 3 times, we waited in the baggage check in for 4.5 hours and then once they stopped changing the gate on us we waited at the last gate for 1 hour. Our flight was canceled unexpectedly and we needed to pay for food, transportation, hotel, and next flights on our own without any worry from Frontier about reimbursement. The floors were covered in dirt, the plane was filthy and had garbage left over from previous flight. Nobody was helpful and they told us they’re going on break and didn’t help at all. The flight was dirty, there was no entertainment, no wifi capabilities, the stewards wanted nothing to do with us, were crabby and wearing un-professional clothes, they charge you for any drinks or snacks that you want, nothing is free. The baggage carousel took an hour and a half to get our luggage, that’s 1hr and 30min waiting for our bags to arrive. Then when we wanted to talk to a representative to see why they canceled our flight and left us stranded in Orlando without food, transportation, lodging and flights, they said they are going on break and didn’t talk to us."

This was our 26th Wedding anniversary, went downhill from there. Also attendant speaking over the intercom said we are delayed again. I proceeded to ask her along with several fellow passengers can't believe this. She shrugged her shoulders to say too bad. The worst customer service I have ever possibly experienced. I have been in the service industry for over 34yrs. I would and never would treat any person like this, especially with grave concerns about being stranded. She continued to tell use all the pilots have gone home after 3 delays. We have flown 2 times with Frontier and been delayed 6 times. Good bye Frontier, we will never fly with you ever again."

I was at the airport at 6.30 am and didn't get home until 2am because of Frontiers mismanagement. When trying to get the refund for the new expensive ticket I had to go with a different airline, customer service was horrible. They didn't let me speak, but kept speaking over me trying to get me to book a flight somewhere a month away and she ended hanging up on me when I asked her why she wants me to fly somewhere so badly instead of doing her job and helping me with my question. I will never set foot on a Frontier flight and since a lot of people were upset with this airline, I don't expect their business to be great after this."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Tampa,March 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My family were on a flight from Cleveland to Tampa on Friday 3/18 at 9:40PM. As seems to be the policy of Frontier Airlines, once my family got checked in and through security, Frontier sends a text message that the flight was delayed ""due to a late arriving aircraft"". Well it seems that ""late arriving"" is the only schedule this company goes by. My family was given a voucher for airport food, but it was useless because by that time at night everything was closed. The delay went from 2 hours to 6 hours and the airline left everyone stranded in a closed airport. My family decided to go back to a relatives and get some rest before the flight, only to find the airport security closed. When we called Cleveland Hopkins, we were told that Frontier did not notify them that the flight would be delayed and therefore there was no one to let my family (and several others) back into the boarding area - so they missed their flight after being at the airport for several hours and going back and forth twice. They were ungraciously treated when they were rebooked, and didn't offer even a free soda on the flight when my family complained. Then to add to the disaster, once again 30 minutes before their flight was to take off on the next night, Frontier once again sends a text that the flight was delayed. So once again my family spent another 5-6 hours at the airport waiting on Frontier. When they finally arrived in Tampa (their luggage had been flown in on the previous flight) they were met with a very rude customer service person. My family hadn't slept in nearly two days and been jerked around with absolutely no apology. "

All they do is overbook these flights to make money knowing that there will be delays and cancellations. They know they’re short staffed but continue to be overbook flights because of their greed and lack of empathy.  I feel helpless.
Not Verified ,A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Cancun,March 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  “The Greenest Airline in America”! At what cost? The consumer, that's what! We are charged for everything and the airline has no organization at their ticket counters or their gates. But they can claim to be the “Greenest”. If you are going to charge for everything don’t you think you would at least have good service? I mean there’s all types of service charges included. Where’s the service I am paying for. Both flights were delayed which isn’t the issue, that happens. The flight to Mexico’s ticketing and boarding was a mess. We spent more time waiting in line to check in and board because the staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing. Once the plane was boarded that flight was ok. Now the return flight was where my desire to write this review stemmed from. First off we were sent text messages stating the flight was delayed by “0” minutes, then a Gate change, then an undetermined amount of delay, meanwhile the board at the airport said the flight was early and continued to throughout. Tickets all stated gate 60 but the staff had no answers for what was happening with the flight or what gate it would be out of. Even after they were asked by multiple customers at different times, they had nothing to say not even a sorry or we are working on getting the information for you. Once the plane finally arrived and the gate was determined the boarding process started and that went fairly well. Once all the passengers were boarded and the doors were closed the Captain said we were just getting a little fuel. The fuel truck came and went (15 mins max) and yet we still sat at the gate for an hour. No explanation, not even a word from the crew or the captain. Another hour added to an already late flight, on a full aircraft, with very little room because they have added more rows of seats to make less flights to be “Green”. They want “Green” but can’t take care of their patrons in a way that makes them feel like giving up some of the comforts to pay a little less for a flight is worth it. Sure the flight might be less but figure in the cost of delays and all the add-ons the airline gets you for and you’re crammed into a small uncomfortable seat is it all worth it? Did we make it to our destinations safely? Yes. Was it a pleasant experience? Absolutely not! The fact the once the flight got underway none of the crew or the captain apologized for the delay or gave any kind of explanation for as to why we sat at the gate on a boarded plane for an hour is proof that the airline really doesn’t care about its patrons. It’s about how much money they can get out of them to use our airline and we can call it “ Green” because we lowered our weight limits for luggage and we will use less fuel. How are we using less fuel sitting at a gate for a hour with everything still running? How are we creating less carbon emissions but letting the engines idle for an hour on the tarmac?"

There were no flights on Saturday or Sunday from Sioux Falls to Orlando. I was told by three different customer service agents to buy tickets with different airlines and would get reimbursed.

I canceled the flight on December 17, 2021 due to illness and was issued a travel credit by Frontier Airlines in the amount of $2554.34 set to expire on March 19, 2022. No flights are available from Newark EWR to any destination national or international. No direct flights are available within a 100-mile radius of NYC to any destination other than Orlando, FL. Three-months of searching with no direct-round-trip flight options that meet or exceed the original booking. Travel Guard denied my claim and Frontier Airlines does not have a solution other to hold my $2554.34 hostage. They will not extend the credit deadline nor will they reimburse me for the unusable credit. This issue was escalated to the Customer Relations department with no resolution available. Do not waste your time or money on either Frontier Airlines or AIG/TravelGuard they are in the business of stealing peoples money."

If you are in rows 2 & 3 they don’t let you put your bags above your seat because they reserve for the 1st row so you have to put them above row 3. However, after boarding starts they allow people to take the space above 2&3 that are sitting farther back. It’s absolutely ridiculous."

First our flight was delayed and the poor flight attendants weren’t even made aware before passengers. Then they told us our flight was at a new gate and that gate told us our flight was not there and sent us back. We have a full flight and our giant group had to go move back and forth between the gates. They told us to line up to board and then didn’t board for an hour. Next time we’ll just take a connecting flight instead. Also I think they delayed the flight again and didn’t tell us because it took us a suspiciously long time to board.

They canceled both our flight back from our destination and to our destination. The flight back was canceled weeks in advance which ok whatever, we decided to go with Southwest our way back because the only option they Frontier gave us was a different day at a different airport with no transportation back to our cars. Today, we were supposed to fly out and got an email a few hours before while we were already on our way - it’s a 2 hour drive - and was told sorry they plane is canceled, no reasons why. I have no trust in this airline and looking at the other reviews, it almost seems like a good thing they were canceled. Never again! Don’t get your hopes up with this company."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to LaGuardia,March 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,  This is the most unorganized flight I’ve ever had. I’ve had Spirit flights go more smooth than my frontier one. My first flight was cancelled so I had to leave a day late and change airports to be able to make it back to work in time. My new flight left today and now they keep getting delayed and today they pushed it back an hour just to cancel the delay so I had to rush here when I live 2 hours away. I make it to my gate in time and then 10 minutes before boarding they delay it 3 more hours and change the gate. If they set a time and have a full plane then they should be able to organize their trips enough to know what the hell is going on and follow a schedule.

Now! Go! Go!” Panic ensued. I was in row 27A at the back of the plane. There were six people per row in front of me with nearly the entire plane still aboard who could not possibly fit into the aisle and run at once without trampling one another. Passengers started yelling, “Run, Run!” No one from Frontier explained what the danger was or tried to calm us. When I finally arrived to the jet bridge, crying and with my heart beating out of my chest, I overheard a flight attendant say that the plane’s weight was unbalanced and that the airplane may tip over. After flying extensively for the last 40 years, I would not recommend Frontier Airlines to my family, friends or business associates."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Las Vegas,March 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,5.0,3,no,2," This is by far the worst domestic airline I have ever flown. Let's start with the fact that we landed at 10.30 pm. They finally unloaded our bags at 12.15 pm. No announcements by the airline, no information, no nothing. Flights that came in after ours on other airlines got their bags promptly. Frontier totally ignored its customers. Then there's the nickel-and-diming for everything. You want coffee. There's a charge. You want a snack. Charge. Anything and everything was an additional charge. About the only things they don't charge for, yet, are air and the bathroom although you might bring quarters just in case. Now the latest scam. Every other airline a suitcase can weigh up to 50 lbs. Not Frontier. Their newest rule is 40 lbs maximum or you are surcharged for an overweight bag. As to the seats, this is a cattle car, no room at all, no padding in seats, etc. Not comfortable. I will say that the check in procedure was efficient, and the people were nice. Unfortunately, this airline has a proclivity to annoy its passengers, and that carried over to the interactions between flight attendants and passengers. All in all: Avoid this airline if you can do so."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,March 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I am writing to you as we sit in a lobby of a hotel we booked at 8am this morning, waiting for our room to become available.. but I need to express my grievance with your airline. We had a 6am flight from Orlando to Boston. We arrived 2 hours ahead (as your site advises) to find the line to check in a mile long. We wanted to check in online but you had zero option to do this with military bags. We were advised by your employee to get into the checked bag line to avoid the $68 checked bag fee. We waited in line an hour and a half only to be told we missed our check in by 5 minutes.  And there was nothing you would do for us and directed us to the missed flight line. We stood in this line another 20-30 minutes and made it to the front where another one of your employees told the 100 or so people in this line to ""form another line over there."" We watched as everyone behind us was now in front of us. Where we waited another hour. We watched as this line became longer and longer with people in our exact situation. We had over a third of our flight to Boston miss their flights alone. The people in the ""missed flights"" line was just Frontier customers and this extended all the way down the entire airport. There was well over 500 people in this line by the time we got to the teller. More as we leave the airport. When we finally get to speak to the teller, our only option is waiting until Wednesday to fly out with frontier OR get a refund and try to rebook today. We originally paid 660 dollars for our flight round trip and was given an $88 refund. . No other compensation in any other form. With no other flights leaving today that we could get on. The earliest and least expensive option for us was tomorrow at 8am. Now this is what we are financially out because of this ... 600 for 2 new ONE WAY flights for tomorrow. 200 for a hotel for tonight. 100 to board my dog an additional night. 50 for our car to continue to sit at Logan airport. Money lost with our jobs because we can't make it to work Tuesday. Then misc for food. Not to mention we are struck trying to find someone to assist with our kids for an addition 24 hours. Plus the hassle and headache. I am so utterly disgusted by the lack of customer service and disorganization to your airline. I will never, in my life, fly with Frontier Airlines again and will suggest others to avoid it as well until you make this right. And to think we are only a few people this happened to today. "

So to start I show up at the airport almost 3 hours early only to almost miss my flight. Frontier booked 4 different flights out of Cancun all for the same time Dallas, Boston, Orlando, and I forget the last one. What did that do, it put about 600 people all in line at the exact same time with only 4 or 5 people checking in everyone. So even though I arrived 3 hours prior as instructed I barely made it to the flight. Then after boarding we sat on the runway for 1hr so we arrived in Orlando 1 hr late even though we boarded on time. After all of this I was just exhausted and ready to collect my bag and drive home just to find out they've lost the bag that they charged me 75.00 dollars to check with no explanation as to where my bag is and the Frontier employees said they have no way to see if it even left Cancun. Inside my bag not only did I lose all my personal belonging such as clothes and shoes but I lost souvenirs from 4 different countries that I cant just turn around and go back and get more. I tried to call Frontier as soon as I left the airport only to sit on hold for over 1 hr and no one ever answered till finally I hung up. I travel a lot and I will never use this airline again ever. There isnt one thing about them that is efficient or comfortable."

My boarding pass clearly states for a 50lb bag because it said on the pass the following: ""Your bags were purchased prior to our new bag weight limits. You are entitled to a 50lbs checked-bag limit.” However they charged me for a 45lb bag in Vegas. I noticed this after I paid. When I arrived in CO I spoke to an agent who stated I would be refunded when I arrived home to DC. Spoke to a rude agent in DC who refused to refund me, she said “Well why did you give them your card? You noticed after? Well it’s too late now I can’t refund you!” And turned away! This is crazy! You can’t play with people’s money $50 is a tank of gas and I want my refund. I tried calling them over and over and each time I got someone they hung up.

No doubt, Frontier is the worst and most unreliable airline on planet earth. After nickel and diming for everything (no checked bag, then let us charge you for a carry on, oh you want a seat assignment, let's charge for that too), they seem to consistently suffer ""bad luck"" beyond their control. They apparently couldn't predict that they would be unable to deliver a suitable airplane to our location in advance and subjected us to a series of seemingly ""uncertain"" announcements regarding their hope of producing and aircraft. One delay, two, delays, three delays, simply put, they did not deliver what we paid them to provide. Then we are offered a voucher that doesn't pay for the inconvenience, but can only be used to suffer their incompetence and discourtesy again at a future date. No thanks."

Even the Long Island railroad has a better on time performance. I have never seen such horrible, horrible service, they don't deserve to even be in business. Not only is it not cheap but everything is extra, bags, carry-on. There is no TVs in the seats, no drinks, no snacks. If you want to buy that 1$ bag of chips your going to spend 5$ and beer is 10$ and a small alcohol is 10. My plane was delayed an hour. It came in exactly an hour late and departed 2.5 hours later! Zero announcements. Chaos at the gate."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cedar Rapids,March 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Orlando to Cedar Rapids. This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. They charge $50 for a carry on plus another $50 for a check bag that cannot weigh more than 40lbs. Then they cancelled our flight at the last minute and did absolutely nothing to find a way home or assist in finding a place to stay the night. Plus the reimbursement they are offering doesn't cover the hotel room or the additional cost of another flight. Absolutely terrible customer service.

It made me believe I was saving but they make you pay for bags over 40. Carry ons as well and it ended up being more expensive. The flights are so uncomfortable. Both mine were behind. The staff were rude to other passengers and I could literally hear them talking poorly about people on my way home.  I will never fly with them again.

We had to be rerouted to a different airport and sit on the runway for an hour before we could get back in the air to reach our destination. What was supposed to be a two hour flight ended up being a six hour flight and the staff was not communicating how long the delays were going to take. I paid extra to have some more leg room but the seat was very uncomfortable, don’t waste your money. They also charge you extra for literally everything. Will never use this airline again."

Once we arrived in Atlanta they said they were short staffed so the sent my car seat and stroller through the baggage claim which took 2 hours. My stroller got stuck in the door of the oversized baggage and I took pictures and called. The customer service supervisor said to wait until they called me back which made no sense to me. I called for a week straight and even uploaded the pictures only to get an email saying I did not report the issue within 4 hours. Waste of money. Do not fly with them.

When we left Buffalo we had bags weighing between 40 and 50lbs not over 50 which was the max weight included in the bags we had to purchase. On our return flight one week later they said when we were at the check in counter we must pay an additional 50.00 per bag as there policy changed in the week we were away and that we can not only have bags weighing 40lbs. The service rep at the counter was very rude and yelling at us and told us it was our fault we needed to check the website, it is not their job to email us any changes. Our flight was also delayed 3 hours going to Florida and 1 hour on the return. When we asked why it was delayed on the return flight the agent told us I don’t know don’t ask me again. There was no communication with the passengers. Very poor customer service. I chatted with a rep online when I got home and explained the situation and she said in writing it’s fine we do not mind if you are not satisfied just don’t fly with us again."

I waited in a line for over an hour to have my bag checked. Then once I made it to the front of the line, they started asking passengers behind us to come check their bags before us. We missed our flight due to this. Then when I asked for assistance to book another flight home, they said they couldn’t help me because they had to help the other customers. We ended up flying with American Airlines which I highly recommend over Frontier. Oh and don’t bother sending in a complaint, because their customer service reps have no clue how to read or how assist unhappy customers. Also, don’t purchase their travel insurance. That only counts if you have Covid or die apparently."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rochester to Orlando,March 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I can't really say enough negative things about my experience with Frontier. We purchased ""The Works"" package so that we had flexibility with our flights. Frontier cancelled one of the flights that we had booked, so we were forced to change our flights to a new date. Frontier then cancelled the new flights, and we requested a refund. They would not refund the $1,000+ for ""The Works"" package because we had ""used up"" the free flight change fees the first time we had to change the flights. This was in addition to them charging $1,000 extra on the new flights when we had to change them. ""The Works"" package only eliminates the change fees but the new flights still cost way more. Absolutely horrible experience and I will never fly Frontier nor recommend anyone fly with them."

We booked a set of flights in the evening to leave midday the following day to go and see the family member. When we woke up this morning, we got the news that the family member passed away in the night. We no longer needed to go and see the family member and would be getting different tickets once funeral arrangements were made. I called Frontier to see about cancelling and getting a refund for the 3 tickets I had purchased. I was informed that they would need a copy of the death certificate and the cancellation fee would be approximately half the cost of the original ticket. The remaining value could then be transferred into flight credit. It is really difficult to even know where to begin. Since when his cancellation of a service some sort of legal issue? There is no reason they need or have a right to the death certificate. The fee for cancelling is ridiculous!  I hope they get good use out of the cost of 3 tickets. I will no longer be using this airline."

So I go to get my luggage and it was never there so I speak with a Frontier agent and she said that the plane is just delayed for 10:30pm, for this cause they said it was canceled.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,March 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. We get to the airport 2.5 hours before our flight. We checked in online and picked our seats so that was done ahead of time. The baggage check in at Orlando was so insane. It took us over an hour just to get that done! And the confusion on where to go was just unacceptable. When we got to the front of the line, we realized why it was taking so long. They had 2 employees at the counter!  And there were many flights flying out around the time we were so there were a few hundred people in two separate lines trying to get baggage check. I saw more than one person get turned away by the time they got to the front because they were going to miss their flight. One lady told me she had been in that line for a couple of hours. It was a real shame. And then security took about 45 minutes. So between those we would have missed our flight, but then the flight was delayed for over an hour. So while that didn’t matter to us, it’s definitely not ok with a lot of the passengers. Not to mention, our flight there was also horrendous. There was a drunk man refusing to wear a mask and they attempted to reason with him for way to long. We all had to get off the plane so that the police could escort him off. Overall, that whole thing made take off about about 3 hours delayed and multiple people missed their connecting flights. I do have to say that the flight attendants seemed to be trying their best on the flights, but you can’t let every flight and the check ins be like this. It’s so unprofessional."

It was initially delayed 45 minutes, then 1 hours 30 minutes, then 2 hours 15 minutes to 12:29am! Then they sent another alert saying you will actually be leaving at 11 pm instead of 12:29am (delayed time). Only for us to get there early enough to catch the 11 pm flight, to only be delayed again until 1215am! Flights are super cheap for a reason, service definitely sucks. I would not recommend any one EVER use this so called airline, especially if you have an actual schedule you’re trying to stick to. Not to mention they completely overbooked the previous flight by 40 people! And everyone had to get moved to this trash flight that kept getting delayed. Just horrible all around."

How does that make or meet any kind of logic. I have never flown Frontier this would have been my first time but I’m just going to with the flow and never booking with them.

Upon arrival we had to sit in the plane for 1 hr waiting for people to arrive at the gate. After we got out of the plane we had to wait for another hour for the luggage to start coming through the carrousel.

We were 2 min late to the doors closing. They would not let us on the flight however they did take the time to stop the plane to remove our luggage and the luggage of the several other passengers who missed the flight. We were told we had to go back to the Frontier baggage claim, collect our bag, and re book our flight at the Frontier counter outside of security. We rebooked the flight (80 dollar for rebooking) and were then told we could not check in until 3 hour prior to the flight.  Never again."

When the flight was canceled, we were handed a piece of paper and told the next flight wasn't until Friday and it was Wednesday! Then my luggage was lost and when I submitted the paperwork for the flight we had to book, we were not reimbursed the amount promised nor were we reimbursed for an extra night of hotel stay.

When we finally did convince someone to tell us what the hell was going on we were informed that the only available flight was in three days.

They canceled the flight due to ""operational issues"" but then told us it was due to weather. They said they could not book us on a flight until 3/1, four days later. The best they could do was fly us to Orlando with an eleven hour layover (which turned out to be 12 due to delays) and then the closest they could get us to Boston was Trenton, NJ. We would then have to figure out our own way home. The hotel we were staying in Mexico was booked, so we had to move to another hotel, wait 12 hrs for the next flight which got me and my kids into NJ at 1.30am, book another hotel there and then rent a car and drive six hours home. When I called and asked about any type of compensation, they said, ""Sorry, fill out a form online."" When I insisted on speaking with a supervisor, all he said he could do was give me a $25 voucher for a future flight. How can an airline leave people stranded like this without some sort of compensation? The flight attendants were not friendly, the people at the counters were unhelpful and I am sad to say this experience ruined our whole trip."

We have had the worst travel experience of our lives with them. First our flight from San Juan Puerto Rico was delayed due to “mechanical problems” then cancelled due to weather in Boston (but other flights left San Juan to go to Boston) and then we were also told it was due to lack of staffing. When the flight was canceled, the staff from Frontier told us there were no flights out until Thursday 3/3. After hours of scrambling to find a new flight, we went up to the Frontier counter and they informed us that they added a new flight, we booked this, they refused to pay for lodging (because it was due to weather) so we had to pay for a hotel and transportation. Last night we already received messages regarding flight delays. We were waiting until 1pm to board for our flight that was supposed to be at 11am. The flight itself was fine. When we landed, they offloaded the wrong flight’s baggage onto our carousel which caused chaos due to the flight coming from Mexico and the baggage didn’t go through customs. We never heard from a representative from Frontier and all of our updates were from TSA and Customs. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage.

This is the second time I have had a flight with Frontier Airlines and I have to say that it's one of the worst experiences I have had. This is not due to anything flight related or comfort but rather their people skills and manners, when I say this I speak about their flight attendants. I was boarding the fly the attendant stopped me for no reason other than to tell me ""There is a metal in the mask, I think you should pinch it. If you want to get on board"". This made me really annoyed because I had my mask on and covering both my mouth and nose according to the CDC guidelines and she really took the time to stop me in particular. I really wanted to give her a piece of my mind, because never, and I mean never in the Frontier guidelines it says that we have to fold the metal with it the mask. I understand that it's for the ""Safety"" of those around me but I been vaccinated and tested, and they still want to make the experience even worse."

The people on the other end of the phone can only cite policy and have no skills to help with problems related to their company.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Dallas Ft Worth,February 2022,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,2,no,1,"  On Feb 20, after our return flight from Miami to Dallas was canceled, we arrived at the Frontier ticket counter to rebook a flight to get home. A couple we traveled with were rebooked at the counter for the next nonstop flight. Me and my wife were next in line and the ticket agent waved his hands in the air yelling ""no more rebooking!' He said the people behind us in line were trying to get on their flight and we would have to wait. I pleaded with him and tried to explain that the line was full of people on the same canceled flight and if he delayed our rebook the flight would sell out. He and the other agents actively refused to help us in any way at all. They wouldn't even check their system. After he assisted the next dozen people asking to rebook from the same canceled flight, he then abandoned his station, stopped booking anyone, and just helped another agent by putting checked bags on the conveyor. So we called customer service and tried to rebook with them. After thirty minutes of receiving no help on the phone, a ticket agent supervisor arrives. The agent supervisor and phone agent were commenting on completely different flight schedules as if they couldn't see what the other was seeing! The supervisor says the non-stop flight our friends got on was already sold out. The only option left was a 6:00am flight with a 7 hour layover in Atlanta, or a flight o the 23rd two days later! They refused to investigate flights from other carriers. The next day we take our first flight to Atlanta, wait for 7 hours, and board our second flight. The flight attendant on the second flight got on the intercom after boarding to welcome everyone on board, then threatened ""no-fly lists"" for anyone that had a facemask on the ""tip"" of the nose, and required masks over the ""bridge"" of the nose. The flight attendant walked down the aisle and threatened three passengers with the same ""no-fly list"" threat.  I get it, people can be difficult regarding masks, but the first contact with the passengers laden with ""no-fly list"" threats was unprofessional and placed undue stress on all passengers for no reason. During the safety presentation, the same flight attendant got on the intercom, stopped the presentation, and threatened to remove passengers from the plane for talking during the presentation. This attendant was on a power trip and was itching to engage in and promote conflict. . I will never use them again."

We were delayed 2hrs for plane issues and when we get to the terminal we have to wait another 30mins because there is no terminal to pull into. It seems like it’s not a big deal but airlines like this nickel and dime you but offer no compensation for their poor service. I recommend spending extra money to fly American or Southwest. Please by all means if you are reading this stay away from frontier!

Once the flight attendants arrive, he announces there is some maintenance problems which will only take a few minutes. At 11:30 he says we are good to go. 11:40 he announces more maintenance problems. 12:15 he announces only a few more minutes. 12:42 flight attendant says we are good to go. We shall see.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Syracuse,February 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My wife, Sister and Brother in law and I had a flight back to Syracuse NY from Orlando on a Frontier Airlines direct flight. We left and got to airport 2 hours before the flight. When we walked in the line to handover your checked in luggage was so long at 5:45 AM (This is Just for the Frontier Airlines checked baggage line) - When we got to the counter 6:10 am (we already had printed the tags and put them on the bags) the lady at the counter laughed, rolled her eyes and in a sarcastic voice and said you'll never make it. We moved onto Security and waited in one of the longest lines I have ever seen (took 30 minutes) and they were rushing folks through. Here is where it got ugly - we ran to the Gate and got there at 6:48 am - Door closed at 6:45 but they had just closed it as they had let 3 other people on including my sister and Brother in law we show up 120 seconds later (they saw us coming) we asked and pleaded explaining our situation (we were there due to our fathers death in FL). The rep then said. We can't open the door, its too late - you missed the flight we can't help you - you should have gotten here sooner. Meanwhile my sister is talking to one of the flight attendants to see if they will let us on board and I am listening to the whole thing - the attendant told her she would go check with the head lady who checked folks onto the plane - she came back and said we can get them on and just re-run the final report. The door from the walkway on the plane was still open. My sister calls back and says the flight attendant came back and said that the head lady went up to the counter and we were not there and had already booked to another flight. No one came out my wife was standing there. Now my sister is upset the folks around her have overheard the whole thing too. So we asked 1 more time- the guy at the counter says sorry your problem not mine. Offered us a flight to Syracuse the next morning? So we stand at the window and waited the plane was supposed to leave at 7 - at 7:10 it finally left. We were 3 minutes late to the Gate - not 10, 13 or 30 -3. Seriously and to be spoken to and treated they way we were was totally unacceptable and disgusting. After the plane left we went back to a different Frontier counter and that attendant was able to get us on a flight to Buffalo NY that was to leave at noon. Now the bags that were not going to make onto the plane 1 of them did and my sister grabbed it when they got there 3 days later our 2nd bag is still in Orlando we were told each day it would be on a flight and delivered to us. That's unacceptable. The Buffalo flight left 1 Hour late, we rented a car to get home and they lost 1 of our bags. Only reason I have given them any stars at all is the staff on the Buffalo Flight. Ironically they asked everyone on the plane to show kindness due to the delay and to keep our masks on. Question: where was the kindness to us in the first place. Avoid them like the plague. They are awful."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Denver,February 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  I tried to book a flight through cheap flights.com for Frontier Airlines. The dates I put in were for 2/21/22 to 2/24/22. The website compiled a list of flights and prices but they changed the dates without me noticing. I clicked on the lowest price available thinking it was for the same dates but instead it was for 2/23/22 to 2/23/22. I called within the minute of making the mistake to get a refund because I saw the date was changed after the confirmation email was sent to me. They all told me the ticket was not refundable even though it was a clear mistake and a accident. I know its only 107 dollars and I know they have a policy like but a policy like that with no flexibility or sympathy for a mistake just seems to me like a way to steal money from people who are not paying close enough attention like some kind of con artist. I seek the refund of my money no more no less. It is not a lot to them but it is a lot to me.

Next flight out wasn't for another 4 days, so we were refunded our money and stranded at the airport with no means of transportation, a place to stay, or even our clothes/chargers/etc.We were extremely disappointed in this experience and ended up spending over 7 hours at the airport from waiting in Frontier lines. Just to have to come back 24 hours hours later for a new flight that we had to pay for out of pocket that cost a lot more than our Frontier flight refund. We were not offered any sort of compensation for our new flight, traveling, hotel, food, and we had to purchase many personal items due to our bags already being in Pittsburgh. We were extremely inconvenienced at the airport and had to miss work for a few more days without any source of income. The wait to check a bag for the flight was over any hour and the TSA line was even longer. The airline was extremely disorganized and the staff were not very helpful. We recommend that you do not fly through Frontier. We will not be using this airline ever again."

Their customer service department is horrible. I was escalated three times and the lady I spoke with last was by far the worst agent. She was robotic and lacked any ability to connect with people. I have no idea how she got to where she is, except to say that Frontier probably promoted her because they also do not care about their customers either. They rope you in with a ""cheap"" flight, but then charge you extreme amounts for luggage and seats. The ticket ends up costing the same as a reputable airline like Southwest! Southwest is the best! If something happens and you cannot make your flight, like COVID, they charge you more than your ticket even costed to change or cancel. What's the point in that? Money hungry, selfish company that has no desire to retain customers. I will never fly frontier again! #NEVERAGAIN"

They last minute canceled our flight resulting in a $300 loss as we had to rebook under Sun Country. They left me with no choice as the cost of lost reservations totaled over $700. They offered me a $100 voucher to compensate for the $700 they would cost me. I'll never book another flight through them.
Not Verified ,Boeing 757,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Boston,February 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is the worst airline. Their customer service doesn't exist, literally no customer service options besides sending a letter to their corporate office. I paid for a flight, 2 passengers from Cancun to Boston. In order to check in for the flight they force you to pay a very aggressive fee for each seat, not sure how you can fly without a seat? To be clear, it was not an upgraded seat, just to have a seat on the plane. Those fee's were almost as much as we paid for the flight itself. Then they want to charge outrageous prices for a personal item (bag that fits under seat) and any other carry on bags. Those fees were not disclosed when we purchased the flight. Then the flight got canceled due to unknown circumstances, forcing us to stay in a foreign country overnight or pay a very high last minute price for a flight on another airline. Considering there were no overnight stay options we ended up flying home on another airline. Frontier sent us an email saying the flight fee is non-refundable. What we paid for our seats and carry on bags would be applied to an airline credit that can be used within 90 days. I would tell anyone considering using Frontier or any company associated with them to stay far away. This is the worst company I've ever made the mistake of doing business with. Shame on Expedia for being associated with them!"

We paid to have a Charter Bus pick 25 of us up upon our return (which we paid good money for), when we first got through to go and get our luggage (on Carousel 3) we were the only ones there. We waited and waited and waited with my 3 and 4 year old grandchildren. Other family had children too. We waited so long. Kids were starving. I got to bed at 2.00 am. I have been flying with Frontier a few times, I am told it's cheaper. But, by the time I buy my seat, pay for my luggage, pay for snacks and drinks, no movie and not the most comfortable seats (no recline) I am think it's not really a bargain. We are all questioning why we fly Frontier. Will probably be switching airlines. "

Some aircraft personnel were very rude. Had to wait for luggage for almost 2 hrs after arrival, no information on what was going on until after an hour or longer.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Miami,February 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," The customer service was sub par and we were delayed and given bizarre excuses right before takeoff that we had to go back to the gate to pick up more employees, that sounded reasonable, but then they added another issue that there was ""too much air traffic"" going into Miami so we had to go back. They were inconsistent in their excuses then all of a sudden both cleared up at the same time and we should be on track to leave at 11.15pm. This was the most bizarre flight I’ve been on and will not be using Frontier again. I do feel bad for the flight attendants because some of the people on the flight were not very nice and I know that it likely was not their fault. Either way, they all need customer service training on how to be more transparent with the customers and not give false excuses for our delay."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Seattle via Denver,February 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I haven't actually been able to fly yet. The airline cancelled my flight.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Fort Myers,January 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1," When we arrived at the airport, my husband was having respiratory symptoms. He decided to take a Rapid COVID test at the airport before we checked in. He tested positive for COVID. We informed the check-in staff we would not be boarding the flight for that reason. They said to call customer service for a credit or refund. Well we did just that and was informed that our flight status was “no show” so we will not be getting a credit or refund. We lost $240 on this flight. I guess we were expected to board the flight and expose everyone to COVID. No problem with Marriott or Hertz to cancel reservations - only Frontier. If you think you could be COVID positive someday, find a more reasonable airline to deal with."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Las Vegas,March 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines is a joke.  I was stuck away from home for 2 days past my return date. That being said, COVID has made traveling harder with fewer options. I booked a trip to Vegas in March. The flight was through Frontier and I had reasonable flight times for my departure and return. My return flight was for around 10 am. I received a notification about two weeks ago stating significant changes were made to my flight. When I reviewed the changes, they changed my return flight to midnight. 10 hours sooner than my original flight. I made multiple attempts to change my flight home without success. Fast forward. I arranged for other travel plans to accommodate my trip. When I went to cancel my flight, I received  16.96 in credit when the cost was 160.96 to book the flight.  I wouldn't have canceled my booking if they hadn't made such an absurd change to my flight. Now I eat the cost for what? As a consumer, they just confirmed I will never fly with them again."

I spied the last 10 rows were empty (I was the last person to board) and slid into the first empty row after the pack. I had a window seat originally and would have had to climb over two people to get to the seat. Much easier to just take an empty row. One question, why?"

We waited in line for 45 minutes and then they opened up another portion and people who had just got there were getting in before us, who had waited a total of over an hour just to get our bags dropped. The staff was very unfriendly about the whole thing. We got to the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed out flight because of how long we waited to drop our bags. Then when we got on the plane the staff wasn't friendly and acted like they didn't want to be there. You couldn't hear or understand anything the cabin people were saying. When we got off the plane to pick up our baggage, it took them forever to get our baggage out and then my friend's suitcases were broken and my husband's bag was torn.

The online booking process is a complete joke if you're not living in USA. You simply cannot pay for your ticket online because you will receive ""Error: Please Review the Billing Zip Code"" and there is no place to enter a postal code for Canada. Same thing with the App. When calling in the phone attendant was nice and didn't charge the $35 call-in fee because he was aware of the problem. This should be an easy fix. Baggage fees were $37, $45 and $47 depending on the time of day and whether you are on the app or your PC. Frustrating - get your stuff together Frontier. Baggage in Orlando took 2 hours to receive. It may not be Frontier's fault but this has to be corrected. What a shame. The flight itself was fine and the staff are great people. With a couple of fixes from Frontier this carrier could be a great budget airlines but for now the frustration simply outweighs the savings."

The flight left Sacramento at 8 in the morning and it arrived in Ontario at 9.40 in the morning. I booked a flight because my family is in California and I wanted to get back to them as quickly as I could. The day I arrived in Sacramento I saw an email saying that my flight to Ontario had been modified. Instead, of a non-stop flight to Ontario they really screwed me over badly! My new flight left Sacramento later in the day now included a 5 hour layover in Las Vegas and I would land at 9 that night. Frontier Airlines you are horrible, awful, and the worst of the worst airline! So, instead of keeping my flight an hour and 40 minutes it turned into almost 8 hours of traveling.

Pay for carry-on, pay for each unit of baggage, pay for food and non-alcoholic beverages.  We thought we'd try flying Frontier because of their advertised ""special"" deal. However, I don't think we will be flying Frontier ever again. Pilots and entire crew were very professional, delivering sympathy and very smooth flights. It's bad enough when you're sitting lock to lock sideways with three people in a very tight seating arrangement. Then to be squashed like sardines next to the fore and aft seating is unnecessarily painful. Recomended solution : Pull out about 4 rows of seats (12) on each side therefore expanding the leg room on each side. Replace the terribly uncomfortable rock hard non reclining seats with cushier, recliners. Include the coffee, water, juice, and soft drinks into the ticket pricing. Having to dig your wallet out of your back pants pocket whilst sardine seated only adds insult to injury. People will pay for personal comforts. You force your employees to have to deal with rightfully unsatisfied customers."

When I spoke to customer service rep and then supervisor, Joanne, they said that we wouldn't receive credit as we were a ""No show""! How did we get home from Mexico then? And I sat on an uncomfortable, 4 hour flight, and won't receive credit. They want us to show copies of our boarding passes which I no longer have.

She was even willing to refund our tickets to Chicago. She was rude and very unprofessional and did not really care.

I spoke with multiple guests that urgently had to get to Denver one, in particular, that would be missing her cancer treatments the following day. There was no frontier associate available for hours to help with the ordeal. Frontier kept everyone on hold for upwards of an hour with no immediate solution to its guests left now stranded at the airport at 10:30 at night.

We were stranded and forced to find flights on other airlines, lodging, food and lost 2 days wages. It has been a week since and no refunds! Frontier is a billion dollar company and a few hundred dollars in a refund should not be taking this long. Please select another airline in your future - American is an excellent choice with an app that has free movies to watch during your flight plus free drinks, nuts and cookies."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Cancun,January 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," First time flying Frontier and it was The worst flight experience I’ve had. We were delayed 45+ minutes without any information (even the flight attendants didn’t have any information on why it was delayed). Once we boarded, I received a text that the flight was late and informed us incorrectly about how long the delay was. The staff was rude during the flight. Once we landed, we sat on the tarmac for 5 minutes. They informed us that it would be another 5 minutes until we could exit. After 10 minutes, we were told that it would only be 3 more minutes. After 15 minutes, they said nobody was available and that we would have to taxi around on the tarmac until they could find someone to help. Poor communication, poor service. Last time I’ll fly Frontier."

Both flights were late or cancelled, they offered no compensation for either. It was a roundtrip from IAD to MCO.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Newark,December 2021,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,8," My flight was delayed a few hours because of issues outside of the airlines control. The flight arrived late at night, but as soon as I arrived, they apologized and provided a small travel voucher for the inconvenience in an email, unprompted and without me submitting a complaint. One of my few experiences with a budget airline that went this above and beyond to treat its customers well. Staff were also pleasant and professional."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to San Juan,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier is a cheap airline coming that actually will turn out to be very expensive for you. I have attached my boarding pass and their delay notice for proof. Their check-in process is horrible at EWR and their staff do not show any sympathy for their over 4 hours delay. I have connecting flights that I will have to miss, they have no will or way to help me at all. in short, if you try to fly Frontier, be ready to arrive at the airport earlier than otherwise, be ready to be late for over 4 hours, be ready to miss your connecting flight and lose money from your hotel reservations and other itineraries."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Atlanta,December 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst experience flying. In a short, direct flight from Philadelphia to Atlanta, Frontier Airlines managed to misplace the entire flight's baggage. We arrived at 10:30pm, and no one from Frontier was available to answer questions. We waited as passengers from other flights came and went with their luggage and after 3 hours of waiting and with absolutely no customer service on-site, I had to leave because my ride could not wait any longer. The next day I called Frontier customer service a total of 5 times, (all customer service is overseas btw), and still no one has given me any meaningful thoughts on what could have happened or where my bag could possibly be. All they keep telling me is that they have contacted the Atlanta airport and will inform me when they hear something back. I am approaching 24hrs since landing and still I have not been contacted at all by anyone from Frontier. I have even tried calling the Frontier office at the actual airport, but no one answers and no one has responded to my messages. Customer service is nearly nonexistent with this company. The low prices are not worth the hassle of flying with this company. Please learn from my mistake. Tell family and friends to avoid this company at all costs. I flew home to spend Christmas with my loved ones, after 6 months of intense medical residency training, and now I having to deal with this frustrating situation. For perspective, this is the first time that I have ever written a review for anything and I feel a duty to warn people of the incompetence of this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas ,December 2021,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  3 hours before the fight was supposed to take off I received an email that the flight would be delayed. This meant that I would be missing my connecting flight which I booked as a single booking through their website. After much effort to figure out how to speak to a real person and being on hold for 20 minutes, they told me that they could book me on a flight two days later or offer a refund. Every other airline would recognize they were to blame and book you on another airline. This flight was to spend time with my family for Christmas and taking two days out of the week I was supposed to be there seemed ridiculous. They were unwilling to offer any compensation outside of a ""voucher"" which I could only get if I went to the airport and was told that it could be used to ""cover meals or other things"". No discount, no booking you on another airline. Something similar to this has happened to me every single time I've flown with them. On one airline they told us to use the restroom in the airport before boarding because the lavatories on the plane weren't working on a 5hr flight. Spend the extra few hundred dollars! They have messed up my plans too many times and don't take any accountability."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Atlanta,December 2021,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,2,no,2,  Worst experience ever. My flight was suppose to leave @ 5:20pm. Every hour or so they kept delaying it later and later. At first they were saying the aircraft had to be cleaned then that excuse lead to another. Around 11pm they finally said flight is delayed until 10am the next morning. I'm currently sitting on the plane and the time now is 10:10am. Now they say we are fueling the airplane. Hopefully we leave sometime soon. The flight isn't halfway full and I asked could I move up and they said it would be a upgrade fee. Book Frontier at your on risk.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Fort Myers,December 2021,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Trust me it's well worth it to pay more money to fly with anyone else other than Frontier. They have screwed me over multiple times and let me pay change fees to change to a different flight that doesn't even exist and won't even refund you when it's an error on their side. They also don't update their apps on departures and any delays, so if you're at the airport and you're waiting for your flight to leave, it's actually leaving from a different gate and you get stuck and they don't do anything to accommodate you or resolve the issue. They just take your money for something you didn't even get"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Indianapolis,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We arrived for our flight two hours early at Las Vegas airport on Dec 13th only to find out there were also 16 other flights from Frontier all leaving at 6am. The line was huge and people were very angry. There were only 4 people working to check bags but hundreds of people trying to get checked in to leave on time. By the time we got to the desk to check our baggage our flight had already boarded and we were told we had to go to ""ticket sales"" (which by the way had an even longer line). This not only happened to us but to several other people. The next flight available wasn't until Dec 15th so we had no choice but to book with another airline and spend even more money. When I called customer service I was told that all they could offer was credit with the airline. Are you kidding me? No refund? For poor service and overbooked flights? It gets worse...they offered credit but it can only be used within 3 months! What? I asked if they could at least do 6 months but was told 90 days is the ""best they could offer"". What a complete joke! That day there were probably at least 100 people who didn't make their flights and had to rebook. How could they leave all those people behind? Oh and another thing - the TSA didn't even open until 4.30am. It truly wasn't possible for people to get through those lines in a timey manner. I will never recommend this airline to anyone. In fact, I will convince everyone I know to steer clear of booking any flights through Frontier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Pittsburgh,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Customer service is the absolute worst of any airline I’ve used!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,December 2021,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,2," The morning flight was overbooked with the next available flight not leaving until 16 hours later, with an arrival a full day later. Gate staff decided TSA/security wasn’t enough, and re-searched my shoulder/computer bag at the gate (no electronics, just clothing/hygiene). Before boarding, they required an ID be shown again. All things never encountered before in 15+ years of flying. This airline used to be friendly and reasonable for a low cost flight. Customer service is becoming last on their list."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Newark,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Do not fly this airline. At all costs avoid this airline if possible. I did not think an airline could sink lower than Spirit but this one has on two separate occasions failed to meet even basic customer support. If you fly be prepared for one of the worst customer experiences of all airlines.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to San Fransico ,December 2021,4.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The flight to San Francisco was ok but with less than half full, but the flight back to Phoenix was scheduled to take off at 4 pm Monday the 6th, the flight was first delayed to 8 pm from 4pm , then 10pm. The problem is that the airline doesn't have enough workers and passengers, they are cheap but at a cost."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Dallas,December 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  I will never again purchase a flight with Frontier. They close their check in desk and app 45 minutes before departure which is enough time to check in and make your flight. They are nowhere to be found and with no away to get assistance. I missed my flight and am extremely disappointed. The app doesn’t even allow you to get a boarding pass to go through security.

I will never fly Frontier again, I don't recommend you do either. Customer service very rude when I called to see about reimbursement for the baggage fee.

Thanks for your help Frontier!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,November 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier, shame on you. Sat in the boarding area for one delay after another.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Baltimore,November 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," The absolute worst experience I have ever had with an airline. My name was spelled wrong on my boarding pass and TSA decided to degrade me for not knowing how to spell my name as it was off by two letters. When I reached out to Frontier to help so I could get on my flight they told me they could not help me with the name change. Which meant I had to fight with the TSA to prove I was who I obviously was by two letters. I made the gate as the flight attendant was just about the close the door and as I yelled, wait, she told me to stand back and slammed the door in mine and my husbands face. The next day, she made a rude comment to us about making it on time. There is an apparent power dynamic with Frontier and they literally have no desire to help. Every person I reached out to gave me an attitude and literally no solutions were offered. It was horrible. Will never ever fly with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dallas,November 2021,1.0,4.0,,,,3.0,3,no,2," A decade ago, Frontier Airlines was the best-kept secret in domestic travel, offering clean, roomy seats with friendly staff and service. Over the past few years, however, this company has sadly morphed into a weird clone of Spirit Air, cramming passengers into uncomfortable seats and nickel and diming for every possible option. None of the seats recline and there's no onboard WiFi or entertainment. After a long, cramped, uncomfortable trip from Dallas to Newark, I won't be flying this airline again unless I'm absolutely desperate."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Cancun,September 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. You will have to pay for every piece of luggage and gouged for it. The flight was canceled from Cancun to Dallas and the customer agents said there was never a flight. What the Heck? There were 45 confirmed passages that had to find another flight. There was no refund and the customer service line was horrible. They do not care about customers or their flights. Please do not fly this airline, you will regret it!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Phoenix,November 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines draws you in with the illusion of cheap flights but beware if you have to make any changes or cancellations to you flight. After booking my thanksgiving flight, I found out I would get off earlier from work. The website would not allow me to change my flight, and when I called for help they charged an exorbitant fee to change it over the phone. When I went to cancel my flight they said it would be a 49$ cancelation fee, so I decided to take the loss and cancel. What they didn’t say was that it’s a $49 fee each way, so I had to pay $100 in cancelation fees for my 129$ flight. When I called to ask for help, they said there was nothing they could do and refused to help me get the flight back or refund me for the fee they didn’t tell me I would be charged, they said there was nothing they could do. Overall, this has been a terrible experience with a dishonest company and I will not use this company again and will make sure to tell everyone I know the same."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Florida to Raleigh ,November 2021,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline ever used, will not use again. Plane had computer issues and couldn't be fixed, de boarded passengers told to go to ticket counter, of course very very crowded while standing in line for 2hours without any answers. A lady walks up and hands out a paper from the airline with options, not of refunding your $$ but offering you a voucher for future flights. Finally get up to counter, person says no flights to our destination until two days later so your option is to read paper and figure it out. So now we are stranded at the airport searching for flights, us and the rest of the hundreds of passengers stranded by Frontier. Hey Frontier way to treat your customers and than have the nerve to invite us back for more poor customer service shame on you."

They did nothing. I wrote down my contact information for them to give to a manger and I never heard back. I contacted customer service online who has been less than helpful. They told me that they sent my in for to a manager and I’ve never heard back. This was months ago. I keep contacting and contacting and all I need is my car seat replaced!!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Dallas Ft Worth,November 2021,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  At this point I will never use Frontier again. My first time was absolutely horrible and their way of making it right was by sending us a $25 voucher that has to be used within 90 days. The attendants and check in staff were unprofessional in speaking with customers and on multiple occasions they rolled their eyes at the customers on both my departing and arriving flights. I let it go because I wasn’t going to make a big deal on our much awaited for trip. Well, on our flight back, there were at least 4 flights leaving to different cities that morning that so many people had to rebook because the check in and bag drop lines were taking for ever. Rebooking wasn’t possible for 2-3 days! Missed work/shorted paychecks, extended child care, additional hotel fees and so on that we had to deal with and take on. I was finally able after multiple attempts to check in on my phone while waiting in line but it didn’t matter because practically all lines were at a stand still. Those that made it through the line were stuck at TSA and still had to rebook due to missing their flight. I will be calling to dispute the $25 voucher as at this point there is absolutely no way I will fly Frontier again so the voucher does me no good."

After waiting in the main line for 10 minutes, one of the staff at check in says Miami, and makes a come this way hand gesture so my wife and I left the line we were at and went around to the line the staff that called for Miami was at. After getting to that line the staff called for the Orlando flight and took those passenger ahead, we waited in line. After finally getting to the staff, he told us the gate had closed, there was nothing he could do. Because of the misguidance, the lack of communication, and incompetence of the staff we lost our flight, car rental, and hotel. The manager we spoke to said that the staff called for Miami several times, we only heard them call for Miami only once."

I canceled on their web page and they are not giving me credit or refund on my ticket. They do not say anything when you are canceling the ticket, they send an email afterward telling you that they are keeping the money. I called couple times and they refused to give me credit or refund the money. If you do not want to have a bad moment do not buy ticket with them. Also they charge too much for carry on and seat selection. They have the worst customer service."

Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Washington DCA,October 2021,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I took two round trip flights with them in the last two weeks. The first flight was delayed. Total delayed time of 7 hours and not because of bad weather or anything like that, we were not given an explanation and waited there until midnight for the connection flight to arrive at my final destination around 4am. It was horrible especially since my first departure flight was at 6am. As if that wasn’t already bad, during the 7 hours wait, they kept on changing our gate having us walk back and forth. I have never had a company change gates so much. Their gates are always changing, which shows a great lack of organization on their part. The following week, I took a flight with them again, they changed the gate for my connecting flight again, when I asked the lady she gives me the number of the new gate (which she made a mistake on). It was far on the opposite side. I ran to go there with my luggage for the lady at that gate to tell me that the other lady made a mistake and gave me the correct gate (which funnily enough was just 4 gates from where I initially was). There I go running again back to where I was on that opposite side. When I get there they tell me that they had already closed the door and I have to go to customer service for them to change my flight for the next one which is in the afternoon 6 hours away, making me miss my appointment that I had on my arrival at Washington DC. Now when I get to customer service, not only does the agent had a very bad attitude and were condescending, but he asked that I pay $80 for them to put me on that other flight. I called the main customer service line and they tell me that they should be able to waive the fees since it wasn’t my fault. I go back there and let them know about it but the person there insisted that I have to pay and even make it a point to let me know that it is the last spot left and instead of arguing I should make sure that I get it or I will be there in the airport until the next day. Because of the obligations that I had therefore couldn’t afford to get stuck there, I caved and paid. After giving them two chances of round trip flights, I can honestly say that I will never use this airline again."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Las Vegas,October 2021,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  The low fare of flight is very misleading at Frontier Airlines. If you choose a seat you will be charged, if you have a carry on bag you will be charged, you are shown more than once to buy insurance, forget about complimentary snacks or drink (no water) without a credit card charge. The unprofessional staff members are rude and work with bad attitudes. This is a budget airline but that doesn't mean they have the right to create a worse experience than it needs to be by not servicing a paying customer. Avoid this low class airline it is trash."

Exasperated 19 yr old-left airport, called airline missing baggage later- and, newbee took down info.Second call-found all info incorrect- ex. Address, Phone #. How did this happen?  Went on line later to file pages of claim info. The hassle begins, 4 months of calling several times a week, emails back n forth.  Pestering me on my vacation, 'ex,' we found it- will deliver to you- and it was a ""surf board"". Found, it shipped to your house; sorry mistake- not your skateboard'. Months of contacting them, and trying to end this nightmare of chaotic useless customer service. And, get my life back. Finally resolved, as of Mid October! Check mailed 6-8 weeks. Talk about customer inconvenience, dissatisfaction. Frontier is a no frills, unfriendly, uncaring airline. When baggage is lost- they hope you get lost in the paperwork, chaos and give up trying to find it or getting settlement (which by the way the loss has been depreciated) Not a win, win, but a lost, loss!"

Made me walk down the entire gate to “see the manager because she was not one” even though when I logged on you could clearly see that I had paid for carry on. She refused to help me and was so rude.

I paid $258 for a round trip from Las Vegas NV to Ontario CA, in less than 30 minutes I realized that the return date had to be changed. I had to cancel the complete trip and I was charged $150 leaving me with a flight credit and they do not refund your credit card. I'm a senior citizen and I just lost $150 and have to take the rest in a credit with the airlines. I can't believe they kept that much money, now I'm unable to take my trip to see my family because of that charge and nothing I could say or do to get a refund or total credit of my purchase.

The Seattle to Denver flight got delayed for 3 hours and the agents even didn’t tell me because all they wanted was for me to pass the gate and go to Denver and desperately look for a connecting flight! I insisted about the emails I was getting which was saying my flight has a 3 hours delay, finally they said yeah there’s a delay and we can do nothing because we have no contract with other airlines to transfer you. They charged me 470$ and only refunded me 256$ (almost half of what I paid). In result I wasn’t able to attend my job interview and I lost the job."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Orlando,June 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Ever, even for “Covid times.” They left me and my family stranded in Orlando 1 hr before flight was to take off by notifying me that my flight was canceled and offered zero options for 3 days for another flight home. Email days later offered $400 credit per passenger but strict stipulations on credit. This airline is a joke. Save yourself a lot of frustration and just book with Delta or United and actually get to your destination on time, or at all! You don’t realize how much going the cheap route will cost you until you’re stuck thousands of miles from home. They did not even honor the voucher. Unbelievable."

Rude fight attendants. Pilot don't speak fluent English. Flight attendant don't speak fluent English. I have never seen flight attendants going to the restroom for 10 minutes each of them at least 4 times during the flight. Also the two pilots went to the restroom 3 times for 10 minutes. Very weird.  They charge for everything. No leg room. Temperature was around 73 degrees. I swear everything was like i am saying. Flight was delayed and my suitcase is stained. No charger for electronic devices. No wifi. No movie. No music. Incredible.

Today we arrived exactly two hours prior to our flight and we were in line for hour and a half just because they kept calling other flights. This is ridiculous I have never had such a horrible customer experience. They don’t respect the line, people who arrive at the very end have more priority than the people who have been waiting for hours. Be late and you will be more respected. Everyone in line was very upset. Definitely avoid Frontier. They have no idea about customer service."

I told them don't lie to me about due to weather, weather is beautiful and then they said due to air traffic control.  Never heard of that and couldn't leave out till tomorrow getting home late Sunday. Every other airline was leaving out even the one going to the same destination which is Atlanta but there's wasn't canceled so what you mean do to air traffic control. They will not give a refund or any incentive so I had to pay $289 on Delta to fly back home this morning to Atlanta that Frontier had canceled for no reason."

We were told departure time had changed about 15 minutes but we were unaware that entire flight changed and we were to have a 5 hour layover in Las Vegas. We had booked and paid for selected seats but did not get those on changed flight with no refund for seat change. Also the plane overheated on the Vegas tarmac and we then had to wait another 3-4 hours for another plane. Staff rude and curtly instructed everyone to sit down during the overheating ordeal, but everyone was sitting down. The passengers were all polite and patient. We rarely fly and if we fly again it won’t be with this airline. I have written to Frontier but they have not responded."

When I came to the airport I was told that the ticket for my 79 year old mother and my minor son is not in the system. I went to the airport at 1pm and my flight was at 3.15pm. I asked can you put us on the next flight together. My mother and my minor son cannot travel by themselves. They said there is no seat available today on any flight you have wait for a later date, it is not possible to put you in a flight today. My son had school the next and I was going to work. I was talking to them for 2 hours and I missed my flight help to get my son and my elder mother a flight. I called the airline, they charged me an extra $275 for my son and my mother on top of my ticket money. $50 processing fee and they charged me $50 to put us on the next flight which was 7.30pm. When boarding the airplane was more than half empty. The pilot said anyone can sit anywhere. They lied and that there was no room. My mother got sick after standing in line and waiting for so long. I will never fly Frontier and will not be recommending it to anyone. They did not care about my mother's health even though I have explained she cannot travel by herself. When calling the airline they did not care regarding an elder's health, just lied to charge more money."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,September 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1," Very rude service. I was on the phone with a young lady last night three times because the credit code I was given didn't work, later on the 3rd call I was told in an ugly way that the credit goes only to the person I had booked with my flight under my booking as well I paid for. She didn't let me speak she didn't help me understand when the first call I made I was asked why the other person wasn't able to go so she can state that reason and that I'm able to use the credit. Only to find out on the 3rd call the credit isn't mine then repeatedly telling me that I can hang up now hello hang up over and over. I have a flight coming up I'm also a discount den member which I regret very much purchasing. The phone call actually hurt me so much that I'm trying somehow to book another flight with a different airline or even just start over somewhere else forget the hotel forget that i just wanted a bit of me time. Its already very expensive but to have to deal with customer service that way is horrible. I wish I would of read the reviews before purchasing from this airline. Less expensive then other airlines but I would wait months to save up $ to pay more to use another airline. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Orlando,September 2021,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I will never again book with Frontier Airlines. The cheap price is no doubt paying for what you get. Their customer service is horrible, by not telling you about fee changes or removing baggage from the returning flight. The other issue is they all have a ""not my problem"" attitude and blame it on the employee I spoke to before them, saying there's nothing they can do about it. My $48 round trip flight ended up costing almost 3 times as much. Besides this, their website and app are absolute trash. It's impossible to get anything done without the website crashing and logging you out, or just not doing anything. Will never be booking with this company again, I will pay the extra money for an airline who cares about their customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Seattle to Washington DC,September 2021,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Chairs don’t recline. No beverages offered. The plane rattled the entire time and they lost our luggage. They weren’t sure where it was for awhile. Their own ground crew didn’t notify them that they missed loading our luggage on the connecting flights (same company) and threw it on another flight. The staff were friendly but clueless. Took hours to finally get our luggage.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Denver,September 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," We used Frontier to and from Florida. They do not provide any perks whatsoever for the price you pay. No one free carry on or one check baggage, no complimentary drinks or snacks. They threaten you to buy online or you’ll have to pay up to double at the counter. Check in was confusing because even though you did everything online, you are still required to go to the counter. You save them having to print a sticker for you. Not enough staff in DEN. Ridiculous about masks. They cram people into a tight cabin, and are still like “we care about health and safety” despite masks being absolutely useless. The flight attendants talked down to us and treated us like children. They then force to listen to about a 5 minute sales pitch about their stupid credit card, as if I would want that after you have provided absolutely zero service or any type of convenience. It felt like an eternity. It was torturous. So I’d avoid Frontier until they figure out how to actually provide customer service. Why were there so many flight attendants who did nothing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Buffalo, NY to Myrtle Beach, SC",September 2021,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," We booked a roundtrip flight from Buffalo, NY to Myrtle Beach, SC in July 2021 via Orbitz. Confirmed via email. Received many emails from Frontier regarding this trip. Successfully took the first flight in Sept 2021 without issue and got to Myrtle Beach. The day before we were leaving I attempted to check in for the return flight and was not able to with a message advising to contact the airline. I searched online and eventually found a number to call, and after an extensive hold time I spoke to someone who advised that my flight had been canceled and I wasn't notified because they didn't have my email address. Again, I have received many emails from Frontier regarding this trip. I asked to speak to a supervisor who was extremely curt with me and advised that the flight was canceled because not enough people booked it. He advised that there was no recourse and no way for me to get home unless I wanted to go to Iceland. He advised they don't rebook with other airlines. Frontier flew me to Myrtle Beach, canceled my flight without notice, and had no option for me to get home and no remorse. I was forced to scramble and book a United flight (with a layover with a toddler) for double what the entire trip was supposed to cost me. Frontier advised they were sorry for the inconveniences and had nothing else to offer me."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Charlotte,September 2021,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I encountered a very disturbing situation with Frontier Air at the Philadelphia airport on September 7, 2021. I was very surprised to encounter at least nine very rude Frontier employees. I routinely fly between Philadelphia and Charlotte and have never once felt motivated and angry enough to write a letter of complaint. I’m a grandmother just visiting the grandkids. I do it a lot. Frontier is my preferred airline because of the perfect schedule and The flight was delayed, and there was a gate change. I went to gate 9 as directed, and waited. A Frontier employee came through asking if there was anyone going to Charleston … not me, I’m going to Charlotte. So I continued waiting. After waiting over an hour, I realized something was wrong and I went looking for assistance. I approached 3 girls upstairs, I told them what happened. They told me to go look for someone in a green shirt. I walked back and forth upstairs and couldn’t find anyone. Then I called Frontier for help and I couldn’t get a human. Then I went downstairs to the ticketing area. I encountered 6 girls in green shirts. The first person I spoke with looked it up on the computer and said it was my fault, and my ticket was forfeited. The next flight out was the following morning. No courtesy, no compassion at all. At this point I’m starting to tear up.. “Mean girl” #1 said, “You need to be nicer.” I was nice. I was just crying. The next “mean girl” said, “You get back what you give.” I was crying, they knew that. Then all six of them started cackling and laughing at me. It was blatant mean behavior. They were taking great pleasure in humiliating me. Just typing these words cannot convey the sneers on their faces and the derision in their voices. I told one of the more antagonistic “mean girls” that she wasn’t the one helping me and she should go away. When she said, “Make me,” that was all I could take. I fell apart sobbing. I did say a very bad 4 letter word when I stomped off in tears. As I walked away, they continued laughing hysterically. Several of them said, “Have a nice day!” I didn’t in any way deserve the treatment I received. I then made phone calls to customer service. Joe at the 9000 number was at least kind, and Dan on my second call was kind and also helpful. He said he would send an email outlining my experience to the “higher ups.” I asked him to send me a copy of his email, which didn’t happen, but I get it. I’m more than willing to admit I may have misunderstood the instructions, or made a mistake  but when I went to find help, I was met with hostility. Six girls downstairs. They seemed to take joy in my confusion. I’m not used to being ridiculed in public and that’s exactly what happened. Once I was in tears, it went downhill from there. I told my daughter in Charlotte what happened, and she found a flight later that evening on American Airlines. Initially I was a hot mess because I got my feelings hurt. Now I’m just really angry."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,September 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Booked flight for 12:17pm depart, at least 4 delays without even a notice. We saw the board and caught it. They even changed terminals and we had to go to the other side of the airport. After 5 1/2 hours, we are now boarding the flight at 5:45pm. We now have to pay an extra day in parking, an extra day in pet sitting fees for two dogs and I am actually visiting in Denver too which means I lost a vacation day. My friend confronted the front desk and she was very dismissive with no apology. We are now hungry and tired and out over $100 more dollars due to their incompetence. I’m sure when I call them tomorrow, there will be a heavy delay with getting someone actually on the line. I highly recommend taking a different airline. This one gets negative 10 stars."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Philadelphia,September 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The staff is terrible and the pilot was awful. People actually got up and left the flight due to how they were treating people.  There was a repair needed to the baggage compartment area under the plane. This caused the bags all to be moved to the rear of the plan. Doing this caused a tail heavy response and peoples seats had to be moved around. I have my 7yr old son with me and we were in the 3rd row in the upgraded seats. We were forced to move back to the 20th row and told “move your seat or get off the plane, I don’t care what you do but you’re getting out of that seat” by the pilot. When asked about a refund for the upgrade cost I was told it’s not their problem and get up. I will never fly this airline again."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Dallas to Orlando,",April 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight was canceled at 10pm at night after we were meant to leave at 8pm. They wouldn’t refund us our tickets, so we could take a different airline. They set us up with a hotel for the night 3 hours after our flight was canceled, so 1am is when we finally left the airport. They took the customers who were screaming, throwing a fit first. Wouldn’t go in order of those who asked for a hotel first. And wouldn’t take the guests waiting patiently. I had to pay for a 45 minute uber ride. The airline said they’d pay for the Uber. I called customer service multiple times later and they refused to pay for the Uber ride. Absolute trash service. Never will fly them again. You’ve been warned, go with a quality airline."

In my most recent flight the pilot took 4 hours to arrive and by the time he arrived the flight attendant personnel had decided to go home because “the pilot took so long”. The airline pushed the time four times and it was 10:30 pm and we were still at the gate waiting to board our 6:19 flight. Do not do business with them.

Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver ,August 2021,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  After this trip I'll spend the ~$30 on a United ticket and still end up saving more than flying with Frontier. They have extra fees buried everywhere - even down to a $3 cup of water and more pitches for their sponsored credit card signups than the US has dead Kennedys, but they can't seem to have a gate ready when they land. Instead of trying to trick the passenger into thinking they worked harder to transport them faster, I'd personally prefer an accurately quoted ETA. I'd also prefer to not be stirred back awake, midway through a red-eye flight at 11pm, to the sudden activation of every light in the cabin just so I can hear a scripted pitch about how Frontier's Visa Card is so much different than literally any given Visa Card, as if it's not another piece of plastic with the same dimensions as the others. We all get it, Frontier: you're keeping your ticket prices down by charging for everything else. So why is every measurably better airline coming in cheaper after the bills have been tallied? Make it make sense!"

The day of the initial flight, after check in completed without problem 24 hours prior, our segment Boston- Miami was canceled without notice. At the airport there were no frontier personnel to provide assistance nor answers. We realized at that moment we had email stating the fight was canceled and were offered the option of buying tickets on any other airline and be refunded up to $400. Frontier agent on phone instructed us of doing same. Now after almost 3 months of sending proof of tickets, purchase and credit card charges Frontier refuses to make good on promises and pay for the airfare cost on another airline. All we got was a ""$30"" voucher to have the opportunity to be ripped off again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Salt Lake City,August 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1," Complete rip off. Feels more like buying a used car from a guy with gold chains. Low advertised price but their interpretation of bags and charge for carry-ons makes this one of the more expensive flights of my life. Why they feel they can charge 60 dollars for my bag to sit on my lap is beyond me. Employees are unhappy, delays inflight, no communication, just sit and wait and hope they get you home. Had a last minute trip for a funeral and booked return with Frontier despite that nagging feeling that you were about to get ripped off. I guess they do not disappoint there. I recall boarding reputable airlines and watching miserable Frontier customers with despair in their eyes due to delays. Here we now sit. Never again."

The self check-in machines were not working so i talked to the frontier service lady and she saw how I had no bags and checking in for me would only be a few seconds, but decided to put me in the very long line. When i finally get to the desk, the guy tells me I'm one minute late for check in even though it was over half an hour before my flight.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cozumel,August 2021,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  You don't get what you paid for! I have recently booked a return ticket from Chicago to Cozumel. It's a direct flight and the price was right - in fact almost twice lower than on major carriers. One week before the departure got a notice from Frontier that the return leg was canceled. They did offer to rebook it on another Frontier flight. The problem was that they fly that route only once a week on Saturdays so the next available flight was a week later. They won't book a ticket on any other airline according to their policies - had to rebook one way ticket on United myself, which had a long connection in Denver. A word of advice to other travelers: always have an escape plan! Periodically check the seat map on the flight you are interested in. If two weeks before the departure it shows less than 60% full - it is a canceled flight already even though it hasn't been announced yet. Then keep an eye on other flights you can use. Once the announcement comes out - usually by email - you have to act extremely fast to rebook another flight as you will be competing with potentially hundreds of other travelers from the canceled flight, and available inventories will shrink quickly. I saw a factor of three price hikes on the direct United flights from Cozumel to Chicago within fifteen minutes after the Frontier cancelation notice."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Orlando,August 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Never have I been so disrespected by an airline. I booked last minute with Frontier after having a Spirit Airlines flight cancel on me. Frontiers front desk agents and phone operators have been rude and un-helpful. My flights with Frontier also became delayed and cancelled, resulting in delays at the airport running over 24 hours! I was informed that I would be receiving a refund and/or flight vouchers for the trouble I went through. However, it appears frontier will no longer honor or follow through with any reconciliation originally promised. While the expense of the flight is only a couple hundred dollars and means nothing, I would expect to be treated better after being stranded at the airport for over 24 hours. Spirit at least apologized, refunded and provided flight vouchers as an apology for their cancelled flight. Frontier was a last minute booking, I now know to never fly Frontier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Madison,August 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Horrible customer service and one of the most uncomfortable planes! Flight was canceled - but was not told that until 8 hours of waiting at the airport being first told that we had a plane just needed to wait for staff, which then turned into we have staff just no plane, which turned into a canceled flight. I rebooked for the next day to a completely different airport because the was the next best option for our group - I had originally looked into this option for our trip because it was a much cheaper ticket price, but they charged me the same amount as my original canceled booking ($300 difference if you are wondering). I had travel expenses to and from airport again and an unexpected overnight stay in a hotel (In Vegas so not super cheap here). Airline would not help me out for the difference in flight prices, nor travel expenses, nor the hotel expense. They offered me a $100 voucher to use in the next 90 days - are you kidding me? You want me to rebook and spend more money with you? That's just not right at all."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,August 2021,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I have to say this was the best experience. Your flight craft has the very difficult task of dealing with masks. We flew down on American (which I will never fly again because of their staff) and back on yours. American acted like they were the lynching squad and threatened to write up you and report you to the captain, which seemed like being scolded by my old high school teachers, and I even had my mask on but it wasn't according to their standards. Frontier however, made the situation very relatable, the staff basically treated the people with respect, addressed the mandate in an adult manner and even made us laugh a little. I went above and beyond to try to make sure I didn't make their job more difficult and for the first time ever bought snacks and drinks and gave the biggest tip I could. So your crew not only has people skills but we willfully spend money on the flight because they were likeable and relatable. Please treat them well and compensate them well, people will remember this and come back just because of them."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Henderson to El Paso,August 2021,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was the absolute worst service I have experienced in an airline. Not only were staff rude, the pacing that this company allows shows their lack of regard for their customers time. An example of that is the 1.5 hours it took from the time we landed to the moment baggage arrived at baggage claim. As a complaint was brought up to various employees (in a polite manner) they all argued with the customer (myself or others). Their lack of efficiency in their check in process caused one customer before me to miss their baggage check as she waited in line for 1.5 hours then missed the 45 minute bag check requirement. This airline is a disgrace and needs to invest in their customer service. I don't recommend to anyone traveling for business purposes as their lack of time management will affect your trip. "

Like who cancels a flight just like that? Totally mess up a customers life without notice. Leaving them stranded in another country.  Their rep had the audacity to offer me another flight 11 days later. And then said I’ll receive a refund 7 business days later like nothing. This airline is the bottom of the barrel in the aviation industry and I see for sure that they aren’t interested in changing even after all of the horrible reviews that are posted about them.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Providence,July 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We all understand shortages of hiring. We understand weather happens. We understand that flights aren't always going to be when we want. BUT When you offer people reimbursement on optional flights - they provide all requested information for flight AND do it in a timely manner (same night as cancellation via YOUR provided links) and this is their experience. Flight 1183 from Providence RI to Orlando FL on July 19th at 6:37PM cancelled after multiple delays given through app on phone. Delay pushes all the way from original flight times to 11 PM leaving hundreds in airport to figure out flights. Stand in line in Providence to get hotel and flight ideas from desk. We were given a hotel (thank you) and told an email will explain next steps. Get to hotel, go with option 1 because - at this point - it seems Frontier will handle this cancellation with grace. Unfortunately, this ""grace"" turns to absolute bafoonery shortly. After completing my request for flight, here's where you take $800 from me: - Told Confirmation will be sent after going through Option 1 flight rescheduling : No email received - Go to Southwest desk in person to confirm request of seats on that flight THROUGH FRONTIER'S OFFERED OPTION are completed - Not only is the flight full, but my name is not in the system. No standby, nothing. - At this point, I just assume the worst. So, I think ""Hey, frontier gave us the option of $400 per ticket through another airline, lets go ahead and do that!"" Take our flights, get home. I think to IMMEDATELY call Frontier to notify them we wouldn't be taking your flight 48 hours after my original flight because you NEVER SENT confirmation and the only reason I got notified I was still on it was by getting a ""ready to check in"" email - more than 24 hours after I already made it home! I was on hold for over 30 mins to have a 2 mins conversation with someone who told me ""not to worry, you'll be reimbursed and thank you for thinking of others with the call and letting us know the seat is open"" - Fast forward to this week - I get an email saying I haven't provided the necessary information (I've sent Frontier information, my confirmation information, all southwest receipts and all contact with Frontier) - but alas, I keep the faith and submit again. Get another email today. No notes in your system of a call from me? Just ""forfeited flight"" and see ya later? "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,August 2021,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,2,no,2,"  Our flight was delayed 4 times and then canceled. When we went to reschedule, they booked our new flight for the incorrect dates- even after reviewing the correct dates with me over the phone several times. After correcting the dates we took our vacation. On our flight home they gave the seats I paid extra money for (leg room) to other passengers. My husband had to sit in the back of the plane and I was in the front. Upon arrival home, I called frontier and told them of my inconveniences. They told me for my inconvenience, they were going to send me 2 $50 vouchers within 7 to 10 days. It has been 2 weeks and I haven't received them. I called frontier this morning and the woman on the phone was speaking over me and didn't want to hear a thing I had to say. She ended up hanging up on me. I called back and explained everything to another employee. He told me even though I was promised vouchers, there was a note in the system which stated to not give me a voucher. I am beyond furious with Frontier but most of all its very rude and unhelpful employees. I am not one to write a review, as this is my first review ever, but I have to warn others about this airline and its extremely rude and unhelpful staff members. One positive thing to say about frontier is the staff on the plane was decently nice."

The first message stated my flight was delayed by 3hrs, the next message stated it was 5hrs delayed, the third message stated my flight was 7hrs late and the fourth message finally stated my flight was over 8hrs delayed. It is absolutely disappointing waiting over 8hrs for a 2hr flight! The word angry can not even describe what I feel right now. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Detroit via Los Vegas,August 2021,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,2,"  Perhaps this is an old saw, but Frontier’s “positive” spin on its baggage policies is a joke. The hidden costs in every aspect of making a flight a livable experience is laughable. Having paid $140.00 over air fare ticket prices to get actual baggage onto the plane, my boarding 1 priority seat was a non reclining seat in row 4! At the back of the plane, I might expect that. Frontier lets you pay for the privilege of greater discomfort! I have learned that one needs to add the cost up front so that the same seat on any other airline really costs about the same as the “discounted” Frontier price. I know that other airlines have adopted similar practices, but this is a case of “fool me once, shame on you,” and there will be no “fool me twice.”"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Phoenix via Atlanta,July 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Low cost air travel that comes with a cost, sometimes far overshadowing the cost of an ‘alternative’ standard airline. Here is my story: First incident on 7/25/2021: My two children were returning home to Orlando from St. Louis, MO on Sunday, 7/25/2021 on Flight # F9 1210. The flight landed close to being on time (5:56 pm). After landing, there were no Frontier personnel available to ‘receive’ the aircraft and/or operate the walkway. The aircraft sat for 1 hour at the gate without passengers being able to disembark. The passengers finally got off the plane and my kids headed towards baggage claim to collect their bag. While they were waiting at the carousel, the belt suddenly just stopped moving. An announcement was made that Frontier only had one person offloading luggage from the aircrafts, and that it was going to be awhile before luggage would be available. 3 hours and 50 minutes after they landed at MCO, my children finally got their bag before we could head home. Up to date I have not heard anything from Frontier Airlines since filing this complaint a week ago. On Thursday 7/29/2021, my wife and two daughters were to fly with Frontier to Phoenix AR for the Taekwondo World Championships that my daughter qualified for. Their flight was to make a connection in Atlanta to Phoenix. The flight out of Orlando got delayed numerous times because of “lack of maintenance personnel” and “waiting for clearance from Colorado” - wait for it, Frontier Airlines only having one person to do the maintenance check on the aircraft before take-off! The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. My wife raised her concerns about missing their connection in Atlanta, but Frontier agent told her that there were 19 people on this specific flight that needed to make that connection, and there was no way Frontier would not wait on these 19 passengers to make the connection. However, Frontier decided the connecting flight in Atlanta to Phoenix would NOT wait on the passengers on the Orlando flight. The Frontier personnel merely shrugged it off and said the best they could do was to fly my family to Las Vegas, and then to Phoenix the next morning. Arriving at 8.30 am. My daughter was competing the next morning for the World Championships at 8am, something she has been training and preparing for for 5 years! At this point she was hysterical, and could see her dreams disappear before her eyes because of the incompetence of Frontier Airlines! My wife and daughters ran through Atlanta Hartford and finally found a flight with Delta Airlines that would get them to Phoenix that evening late. They had to pay an additional $1,765.00 for 3 one way tickets to Phoenix from Atlanta. After purchasing the tickets, they had to collect their luggage (which Frontier could not find for an hour), check in again, go through security and run back to the Delta flight. Returning from Phoenix, AZ on Saturday, 7/30/2021 on Flight 1045 my family had to make yet another connection in Ohio. Their flight landed at MCO at 9:15pm. Again they had to sit in the aircraft after landing for 30 minutes because Frontier only had ONE PERSON working. After waiting for another hour for their luggage, they were told by Frontier personnel that their luggage has been lost! How can one airline be so completely incompetent, pathetic and just plain horrible? The bag got delivered to our home 4 days later. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to San Diego via Las Vegas,August 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I'm surprised they don't charge you to go to the bathroom on this airline. Everything from a carry-on to a glass of water was nickeled and dimed. The seats are not comfortable and do not recline. Nor do they offer enough space to actually open a laptop. Not that you'll be doing much since there's no wifi. This is a garbage airline that charges you for everything under the sun, so it ends up being as much as a more premium airline but without any premium service, such as an extra glass of water. The flight attendants are glorified drink sellers; not helpful. Several people decided to wear chin diapers on my flight from Philadelphia to Las Vegas and the attendants did nothing except try to sell you a $3.25 cup of bad coffee. When my connecting flight from Las Vegas to San Diego was delayed over 2 hours, I was told to shove it since they can delay you up to 3 hours without having to do anything for you. And believe me, they will absolutely do nothing for you; no customer service. Wouldn't even agree to give me a drink on the airplane since they were keeping me away from home for 2 extra hours. I had a 6 hour layover as a result, and Frontier was worse than indifferent; they were borderline hostile. There is no reason this airline should be in business. They are the worst on everything; their prices are not competitive and you have to pay for all services. Choose any other airline."

We were early but almost missed our flight due to them pushing up many who would miss theirs. The flight was good, but then we sat waiting for our gate. When we disembarked, they did not tell us the baggage carousel & we actually got arrested at wacky DFW for going back thru their security doors! The trip back: Flight was delayed a half hour, otherwise good. But then it took over an hour for the bags to come."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Renoe to Las Vegas,August 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier cancelled my wifes flight for no reason at the last second, stranding her at the airport with our newborn. They made her miss her connection home, offered no alternatives, simply shrugged and said they would refund her money for the frontier flight only. Not for the connections they made her miss, or all the expenses they burdened us with by cancelling. ​Absolutely disgusting and unforgivable behavior. No alternate flights offered home, just a callous ""oh well too bad for you"". Cost us hundreds in hotel expenses and new flight bookings, not to mention the extreme stress of doing all that while caring for a newborn. Still cannot believe the subhuman treatment they gave her, just awful. Will never book with this airline again"

Long waits always with delays (which always seem to have to do with mechanical issues). Had to wait 4+ hours multiple times just to fly to wherever I need with uncomfortable seats, iffy staff (definitely not too bad but nowhere close to larger airline company staff) and losing plans every single time. I normally get priority seating with no result or anything happening. Zero entertainment on the planes, I recommend bringing a book since there isn’t any service in the sky."

I paid extra for priority boarding and it wasn't announced we noticed people in line so we got in line. Already was 1hr behind because of a delay which I understand it happens that wasn't a problem. We finally find where our luggage is and wait smooth 30 min so at this Pont we're about 40 min sense getting off the plane. My sister had to circle around 10 times before we got out. No one to report the damage to. My sister flies all the time and said within 24hrs which we did. When I was talking to customer service they contradicted themselves because they were telling me yes within 4 hrs and that was to prove it was from the airport. Next time I will make sure to do pictures of the damage at the airport. Thanks for messing up my vacation. I spent so much time on the phone with customer service. I received an email that said I would get a call in the next 4 hrs I called customer service again which was 24hrs after the email. You need to get a better system.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Portland, ME to Charlotte, NC",August 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline customer service I've encountered. I made my reservation via Priceline. Frontier canceled my return flight, and the best reschedule option would have cost me two more days away from home, so two hotel stays and two missed days of work, which I just couldn't do, so I asked for a refund. Instead of refunding me the full ticket cost of $190, plus the $75 they charged me to correct my name (they'd concatenated my first and middle name, so I had to correct it), they only refunded $109. Not only did I wait on hold for over an hour every time I spoke with them, but they couldn't explain why I wasn't receiving a full refund, and I had a really hard time understanding all the reps with whom I spoke because they didn't speak English very well. I'll never again fly, or attempt to fly, on Frontier Airlines."

After discovering the switch I attempted to cancel my flight for a refund and could not contact anyone and was unable to cancel my flight for a refund. I know this is a budget airline but this airline shouldn't even exist because no one should pay for a flight that is changed or never comes."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Denver,June 2021,3.0,3.0,,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  I was drawn to Frontier because of the cheap flights (I just need to get from point A to point B), but it ended up costing me more. On the way to our honeymoon, our flight was delayed 5 hours with no explanation. That wasn't ideal, but it happens. Coming back from our honeymoon, Frontier cancelled our flight when we got to the airport with no explanation. They offered an amount for other airlines that wouldn't cover the cost of any flight, so we had to take their option of putting us on another Frontier flight the next day that (problems with that are explained below). We told the Frontier rep that Frontier needed to give us a place to spend the night since they messed us up. They gave us a piece of paper that said we would be refunded up to $150 for a hotel if we submitted the hotel reservation info on their website. The only place within that range was a cheap motel, but we went for it so we'd have a place to sleep. I had a feeling that they would find some way to avoid keeping their promise and reimbursing us. Sure enough, we submitted everything they asked for online and didn't hear from them for a month. After contacting them, they finally responded and said we wouldn't be reimbursed because we didn't have that piece of paper (just plain text on white paper) they had given us 1 month ago. The paper, the rep, and the website said absolutely nothing about needing that piece of paper. They had record of the flight being cancelled, our flight being changed to the next day, and that they had the document on their computer. Just a ridiculous way to avoid reimbursing us for the problem they put us in. For the new flight, instead of the direct flight from Denver to Philly that we paid for, sent us all the way down to Florida for a layover before flying back up to Philly, costing us an entire extra day and requiring us to pay for overpriced food at the airport (Frontier said they wouldn't help with any of this). Other people on our plane talked about missing important meetings and weddings because of Frontier's frequent cancelations. The initial price of the flight might be cheaper, but you'll probably end up paying more. If your plans are totally flexible and you're fine with sleeping in the airport, you can take the risk. But if you have anything scheduled at your destination, go with another airline."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to New Orleans,July 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I got to the airport 1 hour and 45 minutes early. It was a 6.35am flight. I booked it months earlier. When I showed up I had already pre-checked in. I went to check in my luggage and the kiosk told me I had to see an agent. The line was huge and absolute chaos. There were 2 ticketing agents and 2 other agents yelling out destinations and telling people to hustle and get their luggage checked. They were rude and nasty. They insulted and belittled passengers who maybe didn't hear and told them it was their fault that they couldn't get their luggage checked and they missed their flight. They yelled out my destination and I hustled to get my bag checked in. The lady then told me at the counter I was not going to make it, by that time I had 45 minutes until my flight. I wasted 45 minutes in line! It was absolutely awful, they rebooked me on the flight for the next morning the same time they said they had nothing else. Shortly after I saw other passengers booked onto later flights to New Orleans. I was ahead in line and apparently out of luck. I wasn't rude or disrespectful. In fact I was very careful and kind understanding they were understaffed. I had already paid for my hotel for that night so I easily and fairly cheaply got another flight on United and quickly got checked in, it was pleasant and calm at United and they were so helpful. After I got to my United gate I called Frontier and they gave me a $59 credit. I argued but that was all they offered. I paid $117 for my one way flight and the baggage fee. So they screwed me at every turn. It was so awful. I will try to avoid Frontier from now on."

Each leg was delayed repeatedly, minimal communication, totally disinterested, apathetic staff. Frontier lost my luggage and no one bothered to answer the customer service despite being on hold for 30 minutes. Also, no in-flight entertainment and no reclining seats, and they ran out of their $3.75 cans of soda almost immediately.

I was so exhausted because I have neck and back problems and the seat at the airport is not comfortable. Frontier Airlines didn't give us any information or the reason why the flight was delaying so it was so frustrating. Frontier offered us $10.00 voucher for food and I couldn't get a food counter that would take the voucher. The $10.00 voucher, you buy two bottle of waters and if you lucky you can get a candy bar and water if they accept the voucher. They didn't even offer us a glass of water while traveling from PVD to Orlando. They should refund your ticket if the flight is delayed more than 3 hours but instead they gave us $70.00 towards. I paid $43.00 for my small bag which it's ridiculous and this is another reason that I don't want to fly with them. I'm very disappointed with Frontier Airlines and I don't wish to travel with them anymore."

On our flight there was was no social distancing and the washroom was horrible. My husband said he went to the washroom and it smelt and it was not clean. I gave my husband a Clorox wipe and hand sanitizer. Someone took our bag at the airport and when we tried to get assistance from the airline we were told to fill out a claim. I told the customer service representative that I put in a claim 30 minutes before calling. I had to pay $37 for a claim. It took an hour to speak to someone because we were bounced around to several different representatives. Luckily, the gentleman who had our bag and we had his found me on Facebook and met to get our bag back. I told the representative to give my number to the guy or give us his number. They said they couldn't do that. I'm going to dispute the charge and get my money back because they did not help us at all. This morning I received an email stating we filled the wrong claim. It stated we were supposed to claim for lost luggage which is what I did. The email stated the claim was for missing items at the airport. Well, my entire luggage was taking by accident."

I am used to wearing a mask all day as I am an engagement director at an assisted living facility. There was a female flight attendant manning the overhead storage up front. We thought nothing of it until my mom was putting her backpack up there and she told her “ma’am that’s your personal item, it will need to be placed under the seat in front of you.” All while others are stuffing suitcases in the overhead bins. She didn’t seem to mind watching them do it. Gratefully, my mom who is never outspoken said “but I paid for a carry on.” The flight attendant then turned and requested that only my mother out of all the people stuffing luggage on the plane, show her boarding pass to prove she paid for carry on. Again, all while people around are stuffing multiple bags (even one lady stuffing her bag on top of my laptop bag, in the overhead bins-nothing was said. My mom obliged without even an apology from Debbie. It was embarrassing to say the least. I watched her the rest of boarding and she did not have this request of anyone else. After which the captain held us captive 30 more minutes after the flight had landed for reasons of “people being prematurely unbuckled and standing” at 11:32 with us getting off the plane at 12:02am…it was a very weird and unsatisfactory situation."

Each was 50lbs before we went to the desk to check-in. They used their scales - each suitcase on different scale - one showed 50lbs and the other showed 52lbs. Other airlines would allow you 52lbs/suitcase without any issue but they still asked us to pull things out of the suitcase to make it 50lbs. I told them that I had weighed them for 50lbs before I came here and we had used the scale at the corner (the SLC scale was at the corner, very close to the Frontier Check-in). The lady still told us to pull things out and they said they only used their scale.

First our flight was delayed an hour due to weather and I understand and recognize this is completely out of the airlines control, Denver has horrible winds and rain. Regardless of this we were informed via the pilot of our delay and never via email or text from Frontier. Then we were allowed to return to the terminal but told we would receive an update in 30 minutes. I then notified my family that I would be late and to pick me up whenever my flight landed, they were monitoring the flight status. However, Frontier never updated their website to reflect any change in departure. The desk agents continued to update us with additional 30-45 minute delays. Then we were finally informed that our flight was boarding so we filed on to the plane. Once everyone was on they informed us that we all had to get off again because no one had scanned our boarding pass. I could not believe this, how could they let us all on to the plane without thinking of scanning or making sure we were all supposed to be there. After a series of delays we left about 3 and a half hours after out scheduled time. Only then did we receive any notification about the initial hour delay. At this point everyone was tired including my family who was patiently waiting for my texts as to when we departed because the website showed our estimated landing time 2 hours prior. The pilot announced that we would be receiving compensation for this flight and I thought great because they could not get it together. Only then was I informed we would be getting a voucher which did not come to my email and I had to call in order to get. I will never fly Frontier again."

It took almost 3 hours to fix the problem. After missing the correcting flight in Denver we stood in line to speak to customer service for an additional 3.5 hours. After being placed on a flight to San Francisco? That doesn't leave Co. until Tuesday noon. Damn near a whole 24 hour after getting on the first flight out of D.C. This airline is the worst. What a messed up Vacation. I will never fly this airline again.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Trenton,July 2021,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,4,no,1,"  Just pay the extra money to fly a better airline. Every single flight we’ve had with Frontier has a delay. From Charlotte to Trenton 2 hour delay .. now, I’m sitting at the Trenton Airport and we were just informed a 2 hour delay! There is another flight here for Tampa and they have a 3 hour delay, with very angry passengers- literally yelling at the counter girl. It’s a shame, just pay extra and fly with a major airline. I won’t get home now until after 2 am! Pending I don’t get another delay."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Las Vegas,July 2021,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  Our experience with Frontier was very poor. The first major problem was getting to the terminal where they were located. We parked at “the parking spot” and shuttles to the main terminal where we found out Frontier is located at the south terminal and there is another shuttle that has to take you there. That is the ABIA shuttle which was extremely shorthanded when we departed and arrived. Second, the plane seats were extremely uncomfortable. The seats didn’t tilt back, no headrest support, etc third, they nickel and dime you on everything after the fare price. They lure you in with cheap fares and charge you for carryons, checked backs and even seat choices. The drinks were not free either. I would never recommend this airline to anyone flying after this experience."

We originally had a 7:00pm flight to arrive in ATL at 930. It was cancelled and we were put on a 9:00pm flight. Then it was delayed not once, not twice, but three times for a 1030 departure with an arrival in ATL at 1240 am. We’ll see if we actually get out of here tonight. At 600 pm we were given some nonsense story of a flight from Myrtle Beach being delayed so ours was.  And we were stuck at the worst airport I’ve ever been in - Miami International. I will never fly Frontier again. If I could give it a 0/10 I would."

They sent a text that afternoon saying my flight was delayed and then another that it was delayed again. Got to the Cleveland airport and it was supposed to take off at 10.:04pm. But after more delays on the ground including maintenance issues we didn't leave until after midnight and didn’t land until after 2.30am. Went to get luggage and ended up waiting for almost 2 hours for luggage that never showed. And there were two other Frontier flights waiting on their luggage too and for longer. No one could tell us a thing and other passengers were either trying to find someone for answers or trying to call and find out what was going on. One lone person at the Frontier baggage office who couldn’t tell us what was going on other then she was calling to try and find out. I had to give up at 4am since my ride needed to go home to sleep before he went back in to work. I called Frontier and all they would do was tell me to fill out a claim.

It’s Sunday morning and we all have to get home and we can’t wait until Tuesday they said there was nothing they could do for us. Really frontier… And you want any of us to fly you’re airline again? It is totally unacceptable to overbook flights and then tell people there’s nothing you can do for them. It is your responsibility to find everybody away home, on another airline, give them vouchers they can use elsewhere to get home, rent them a car.  Never flying Frontier again"

You want a carry on? $57. Want to sit together? $20 per person.  It’s insane. Flight attendants were rude."

Once I finally got to my destination, however, my luggage did not make it. I have filed a claim and have emailed them multiple times. It has been a month and I have yet to receive my luggage.

Don't fly this airline with kids especially, you are going to have a bad time. They make is seem like you save money on low cost tickets, and then extremely overcharge for carry on and check bags. After all is said and done United or Delta would have been cheaper and no delay, spent well over $1,000 for the 4 of us. They also announced they had no snacks and or refreshments available on flight only alcohol because their flight crew were tired from the delay and wanted to leave.They should refund all of us on this flight, extremely disappointing. 0 stars"

I priced out other airlines and needed to know what the refund amount would be for the last half of that round trip flight. It was $5.36. Not half of the fare.

Frontier Airlines has been so disorganized, so unprofessional, they charge you for carry on bags. Our checked bag cost a total of $175 and we had already prepaid $60 online. Our flight was delayed “due to weather” when no other airline was delayed. We’ve been sitting on the taxi waiting to take off since 2.40 and it’s now nearly an hour later. We were told we’re 18th in line and now we’re 25th in line, our connection has obviously been missed in CO on our way to MT so we have no idea what to do from here.

In the past I experienced that they changed the flight and changed my from a direct flight to one with stops I got a voucher to flight with them again. In my next booking they cancel the flight 5 hrs prior the fligth and sent an email with the options saying they have 48 hrs to send you a voucher for rebook with them (of course not an option) or that you can rebook with another airline and they will mail you a check 14 days  after (if you use their third party company) or 46 weeks after if you book with the other airline directly instead with their rebooking third party company. When people flight they have plans that needs to be readjusted so not everyone has flexibility to wait 14 days or 46 weeks (ridiculous) to receive the money back. You are pushed to have additional money to pay for flights in case they mess up and obviously you will pay much more as is last minute if you are lucky to find flights. So as you need to have the money anyway to flight with someone else then save you the pain and book with another airline from the beginning, you will save time, money and much important avoid the stressful situation."

If we want to fly with a different airline it will have to be completely out of pocket as Frontier said refunds will take 7 days, and not even the full refund.

I recently had an issue with a transaction, after my flight this past week. I was charged 300$ for a flight from Denver to charlotte. My bank account shows the money came out of my bank account. Frontier says it didn’t. And they won’t honor the ticket price while I was trying to sort things with my bank. They were callus, disingenuous, and uninterested in helping to resolve the issue. I won’t make the mistake of ever ever flying frontier again. This isn’t my first issue with the customer service either. After my flight this passed Monday (7/12) was delayed 2 hours and 45 minutes, customer service wouldn’t reschedule the flight.

The reason was that my wife has a valid Venezuelan passport and a green card (US resident), they said that she was not allowed to get on the plane with those identification documents. That she needed a US Visa in order to fly. We talked to the manager and in an act of discrimination against my wife they decided to reject her from boarding. There was no more explanation and they were extremely rude with us saying that they couldn't escalate the issue to a higher level because that was the rule. They didn't care about the passenger just because they felt superior not even giving us the opportunity to explain something that is evident, a US RESIDENT doesn't need a US VISA. Frontier made us have the worst time, made my wife feel discriminated just because she was from a country with some regulations, and the worst part, they didn't hesitate at the time of blocking her from boarding and loosing thousands of dollars invested on our entire trip. So we had to run to the airline next door (United Airlines) in order to buy the plane tickets again. Of course United Airline staff was impressed with our story, being a fact that there is no way they can deny a passenger to board with a US Residency and a valid passport. Frontier is the worst airline.  I tried to call customer service, and after 2 hours 45 minutes hold I was able to get a refund."

Had to drive over 1100 miles in a vehicle with my daughter for 17 hours to Columbus, Ohio.

I also had to wait for my luggage for 3.5 hours as no one in Frontier Airlines could locate my bags after I was told it would be 30 mins until receiving them.

Basically all of us were leaving on an 8 am we didn't get our flights rescheduled or canceled until like 2pm and then our bags until 4pm (until everyone got through the line to TRY to get help). Customer service was absolutely terrible they were not addressing us at all. A couple next to me had their flight scheduled and they had a crazy ticket that the Journey would take 2 days more!

Flight is cheap, until you factor in having to pay for even a carry on. But okay. Flight is cancelled. Due to weather. Again, okay. After exiting the plane all the passengers are told they’ve been automatically rebooked on a flight departing the following day at 12.05 pm. Sucks, but hey, okay. Next morning, flight still not showing up on Frontier Airlines app so I can check in and print boarding pass. Call reservation number. Told that I’m booked on non-stop flight departing Tampa at 12.05. Arrive at airport, stand in long line at counter. Line doesn’t move for 30 minutes. Finally ask about line, told wrong line. Pointed out that would have been nice to know 30 minutes ago and a sign would have been nice. Response is they normally don’t have two lines. Myself and ten other people change lines. Finally get to counter. Told sorry, but the flight I thought I was booked on doesn’t exist. Woman at agent next to me upset because she is told the same thing. Agent acts like she is lying when she explains she was told she was booked on a 12.05 flight. I let them know I was told the exact same thing. Told no flights today unless I’m willing to drive to Orlando and take a flight there departing at 8.55pm. Ask is they will provide or reimburse for a shuttle to take me there. Told to contact customer service for that request. Given phone number for customer service. Call number provided and wait on hold for 40 minutes. Person who finally answers is not real customer service, eventually convince him to connect me to the real customer service. Ask for number. He won’t provide it, but he does connect me. Wait on hold another 30 minutes. Explain everything again. Transferred to another customer service rep. Finally told they can only book the alternate flight, can’t pay to shuttle me to airport. Request full refund. Never flying Frontier again. "

They canceled my flight to Tampa and email me with no reason why the cancellation of flight. I try to call customer service and was on hold for a long period of time waiting to get nothing solved. Terrible airline. I will never book with them again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Miami to Newark,June 2021,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,4," First off, we flew out of United at Newark, and the terminal was amazing. Terminal in Miami was too small for flight loads, our flight was delayed due to weather and then the crew had to be changed (FAA regulations). The gate we started at was too small, there were less than 30 seats. Our flight was moved to a different gate. I wish I took a photo because it was ridiculous. There were about 2 dozen seats but they were jammed into the tiny space, literally. I mean, the seats themselves were touching so that you were touching knees with the person across from you. The gate waiting area was really only big enough for a small commuter plane, not a big airbus. Zero charging areas, and only 1 wall outlet I could see. My son and I spent our next 3 hours on the floor. The first 4 hours we were at the bar by gate 10 which was fabulous, the food was meh, but the service was great. Let’s face it, I didn’t think I was getting a 5* meal. Sadly, not long after our gate change the bar closed. There was a clear lack of communication regarding the timing of our flight and the reason for delay. Finally boarding the plane, the crew were rushing us as they explain that we can take off faster if we are ready faster. But, they were friendly. We sat with the door open at the gate for 45 minutes while a mechanic came in and out with a clipboard to talk to the pilots a few times. After waiting in a closed terminal for 2.5 hours, the crew was nice enough to offer water for $3. The flight itself was good, no complaints there. Arrival in Newark showed the terminal at the other end of the trip was just as ratty and tiny as it was in Miami. My United flight was about $50 more per person but included snacks and drinks, movies or TV shows and more comfortable seats. Also seats, wifi and charging at the terminal and a multitude of restaurants. (Again, there was none of this at either frontier terminal on either end of our trip) Paid just under $300 for 2 tickets advertised for $50 tickets each. I wouldn’t even say you get what you pay for because the difference in price for the United flight easily offset all the additional amenities which made our travel comfortable and pleasant. Oh. And I’m still waiting on my suitcase. It’s been 2 days."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,July 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First and last time flying this airline! We are waiting in the airport for over 8 hours In Newark for so called maintenance issues, only to be cancelled. While waiting the airline only offered a $10 food voucher after passengers complained. Once the flight was canceled they offered no other flight option other than a week later. How can you strand passengers for a week. Eventually we are given options of refund or $400 toward a ticket on another airline. I won’t even get into the 3+ hours on the phone. I ended booking out of another airport the next day with frontier only to have that flight cancel as well with the excuse of maintenance again. I end up flying out on another airline and am hoping I will get reimbursed as promised. Fast forward to my return flight home- you guessed it. First we are delayed 2.5 hours for maintenance which conveniently turned into a weather delay. The airline lacks any compassion for their passengers. I understand you can’t control weather but three flights I a row had maintenance issues. If the return flight didn’t have maintenance issues we would have left on time and not been delayed for weather."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Miami,July 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will never fly this airline again. I got into the airport to check in and that’s when I was notified that my flight has been canceled to Miami, I didn’t get an email, I didn’t get any notification telling me that my flight was canceled. This is one of the worst airlines of the customer services. Please avoid this airline as much as you can, on top of that all the flights were all booked because we were flying Fourth of July weekend, now unfortunately I’m going to lose a day in Miami."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Las Vegas,June 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our carry on tested perfectly in the Plastic test thingy, they so called ""ran out"" of overhead room and made me pay $150 for a carry on. In actuality they had more than enough room over head, some where even empty. Again they made is pay $150 for nothing. Do not fly this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Miami,June 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  They call themselves running a special but then want u pay additional for an assigned seat. You get a deal but not really a deal because of all additional charges. I lost money with in June and so did about 20 other passengers on the same flight and nobody wanted to really explain themselves nor help us. Please pick any other airline but not Frontier - you will be better off riding Greyhound to get to your destination, I’ve tried several airlines in my life but this one right here beats the cake. "
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Los Angeles,June 2021,2.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Before the take-off from Phoenix the flight attendant was very rude to my husband asking him to make sure his mask was covering his nose. I do agree with her statement, but she was not polite or kind, she was loud and rude. My husband changed his mask and we had a normal flight. When we landed at LAX on my way out to the airplane, I was carrying my 1-year-old in my arms and I asked her name and she refused to say, then asked the crew lead in front of the airplane but he also refused to tell me her name. My husband was already outside of the airplane when he noticed our stroller was missing a part, he walked back to the airplane to ask a question and the crew member yelled 'get out of the plane now' passengers were shocked from his attitude and we do have witness’s information. My husband, my mother-in-law, my 1-year-old child and I felt disrespectful by the two crew members. We had a verbal threat by them saying that the captain wanted to make sure we will never fly the airline again. They screamed at us inside the airplane and walked all the way to the airport lobby where everyone was watching and recording the discussion. There was a lack of respect, courtesy, and customer service, both were impolite, and we can consider this as an assault as both verbally threatened us. This is the first and last time flying with this airline and our family have visited over 30 countries and have flew with multiple airlines but never felt disrespected from any airline besides the Frontier flight attendants. Very disappointed."

Not Verified ,Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas via Cabo ,June 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  This was by far the worst. Plane was delayed on the flight there and flight back for 1.5 hours each time. On the flight back they left 20 passengers that missed their connections stranded in Las Vegas on a Saturday night with no offer of anything other than a ticket the next day. Problem was any hotel in Las Vegas was well into $300 with taxes and resort fees and a $27 dollar transportation fee to and from the hotel. Even made me pay additional bag fees at the airport. Seems like they are incessantly late on most flights. Even my trip back the next day was 40 minutes late getting in and they didn't even mention it to the passengers. 
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Buffalo,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had a flight for June 28, it was cancelled. I was supposed to go to my grandmother funeral, customer service was poor in the airport and over the phone no resolution to my problem, no one tried to fix it or even cared. They wanted me to pay more money with another airline and they would reimburse me. Who has money to pay for another flight and wait several day to get their money back and only pay up to 400 dollars. I will never do business with this airline again and I would not refer anyone to them. You should be shut down due to your lack of capability to satisfy the customer, I am upset and hurt that I could not make it to my only grandmother funeral to pay my final respects."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Cincinnati,June 2021,2.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,3, Frontier canceled my flight 4 hours before take off and left my friends and I with no options to get back home that were within the $300 reimbursement limit through the Airport we came in at. Instead we had to travel to another airport to get home and are still at a loss financially due to this limit. We had additional baggage fees and were spread out all over the plane with no option of seat selection. After calling the airline we were told there was nothing that can be done and to complete reimbursement options online because they do not handle flights over the phone.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Cleveland,June 2021,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We checked in for our flight (92) from Cancun to Cleveland, which was supposed to depart Saturday at 2:58pm. Once we were done going through security we got a delayed alert on our phones, but it still said on time on the departure board. We went to the gate our flight was supposed to be at, which was being used by a different airline. I found a gate with our airline (Frontier), no one could give me any information. We kept getting notifications to our phones pushing back our flight several times. Still not a single item of information was shared by an employee. We continuously tried to ask what was going on, because at this point we had been delayed a total of 8 hours. They just flat out ignored us. Then we got notifications our flight was cancelled!!! Still they told us nothing!!! Come to find out our flight wasn’t the only one that got canceled on Frontier. This had been happening for awhile. They keep booking flights even though they don’t have enough people to staff them!!! We then had to take buses out of the airport and back through customs, to a crappy hotel where we stayed for 3 hours only to return to the airport at 3:30am for what is supposed to be our new 7:35am flight. There weren’t even employees to check us in till 5am!!! They dropped us at a closed airport to save some money on a hotel. Then as soon as we all got checked in… our flight was delayed again. For the same reason. It got delayed a second time after that. Now we are still in the airport and it has been almost 24 hours. Not once did an employee give us any information today either. I don’t even think after we checked in we saw a Frontier employee. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a company. They didn’t even offer to refund anyone’s flights either. Definitely lost my business!!!"
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Denver,June 2021,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,3,yes,5,"  I need to be fair with my review. We flew Friday 25th from Fort Myers to Denver and even though the seats are tiny and not comfortable, with no wifi or connectivity and they don’t give you even water to drink (unless you pay it) the flight left on time (8.23 pm) and the pilots did a wonderful job flying through a heavy thunderstorm and brought us back safe and sound! The landing was perfect! Frontier should be proud to have them!"

I then rebooked my flight and noticed that they booked my return flight for Monday instead of Sunday, now I'm being told either cancel or don't, customer service is so rude and will not help! nNow i have no choice but to book return flight with Southwest."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Orlando,June 2021,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst experience ever! Traveling with different airlines and never experienced such a poor management, service and time accuracy. Landed at 6:08 and stayed stuck in the plane until 8:01 pm and still had to wait another 66 minutes for the bags. The crew was begging for no one to accept the cup of water but offered it as “complementary “after almost 2 hours of being in the plane because the gates were closed staying they had very limited water.All you can hear from them was rules and reminders of devices must to be mute… really? And not to stand up.  Again not worth it the one way $50 to Orlando. Southwest was $89 for one way bags included and complementary snacks waters and cleaning several times during the trip. This is our last trip with Frontier no even with voucher or free."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Orlando,June 2021,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flight from Philly to Raleigh with connection to Orlando was delayed for over an hour, then passengers who had the connecting flight to Orlando had to get off the plane to seek other options. I was offered a direct flight from Philadelphia to Orlando the next morning at 5.49am, which was 17 hours away. After waiting 3 hours to get my luggage back, I inquired about a room for the night, and was advised by a Customer Service rep over the phone that a Ticketing Manager would accommodate, but when I approached the Manager, I was advised that I was given false information. I spent the 17 hours at the airport. I was able to check in for my new flight at about 1 am. Frontier did nothing to help any of the customers who were stranded at the airport for extended periods of time."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,  Most horrible experience and follow up with every customer service was awful. Do not book no matter how cheap. My children were refused flight after we purchased their tickets because of their age. Customer service called me a liar refuse to give us a refund or help us find another flight. Awful terrible. I fly very often and this was the worst experience ever! Don’t book!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We had 4 travelers in our group (I purchased round trip tickets) and the day before our return flight I checked all 4 passengers in. The day of the flight my son decided to spend more time with family because it's summer. I figured I would just enjoy the 4th seat because he was checked in and it was paid for. I have a 2 year old and with coved the extra space between strangers is appreciated. However, when we boarded Frontier had taken the liberty to assign that seat to someone else. This frustrates me because 1st I paid for the seat and 2nd I had checked all 4 passengers in for that flight. I have contacted Frontier for a partial refund or flight credit and they have never responded. We wont be flying or recommending Frontier Airlines to anyone. This is our 2nd time using them since 2016 when we spent all day at the airport for them to finally cancel our flight because they didn't have a pilot for it. Not a good airline, and the online reviews show that."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake to Denver via Albany,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Had a round trip flight booked. When Frontier cancelled my flight home, they required me to pay an additional $250 instead of matching my original ticket price. Keep in mind, Frontier was the one to cancel, not me. I am disappointed with Frontier and their low level of customer service. Talked with 3 people on the phone and couldn't get anywhere. I will not be recommending Frontier to anyone, no matter how affordable flights may be. It is absolutely not worth it. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Orlando,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines is the worst airline ever, they have fraudulent business practices and refuse to make concessions for their mistakes. Flight was booked and upon checking in 24hrs before, an email was received about a 2-hour delay that was supported by their website later on that evening. About 1hr before the original flight time another email was received that flight was leaving on time, that was not enough time to get to the airport, as a result the flight was missed and they refused to refund my money. All they offer is a credit though I expressed there are no plans to travel within the next year. How do these people sleep at night knowing their customers are scammed daily?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Fort Myers,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes early. Baggage check line was enormous. Waited for an hour and 45 minutes. Finally put my bag on to get weighed, they announced that everyone had to rebook their flights. There were flights to 3 different cities, all had to rebook. The next flight was the next day. Ridiculous. Their incompetence caused over 100 people to miss their flights. Never will I choose them again. I went and paid extra to fly Delta. I should’ve trusted all of the negative reviews."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Green Bay to Las Vegas,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  First off the seats are like sitting on a plastic lawn chair. There’s absolutely NO leg room whatsoever. Even when you “upgrade”, it’s not an upgrade at all! The only difference is that the seat color is different. Second, the staff is rude and completely unprofessional.  No consistency at all. My husband and I wore the same masks on 3 flights, our 4 flight connecting us home, they said we couldn’t wear them because it had a “vent” even though inside the mask was a filter. They told us we weren’t allowed back on the same plane we just got off of. They also try to sell you on a credit card, while in flight! They do not offer any water with Covid happening it’s understandable, but if you want to purchase a small bottle of water you can do so for $3.99! Even before getting on the flight, booking was nuts. Charged for picking a seat (more for a window seat), charged for a carry on, charged for a checked bag, they wanted to charge me for my small crossbody purse! Overall the experience was terrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Salt Lake City to Denver via Branson,June 2021,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," What a nightmare trip. Absolutely no amenities - no water (without purchase), snacks, too small of pull down tables, no way to charge anything, flight back was delayed by 1 hour and 15 minutes without telling us why until the very end. Branson airport was extremely hot. The only good thing was that those of us with connecting flights could get off first. I barely made it to my connecting flight. A flight attendant made a bullying announcement saying that if we dared take down the mask below our nose, we would be arrested at landing and put on the no fly zone. Excuse me, but how are you supposed to take a drink or eat your own snack, or my grandson stay happy with some snacks? Then the connecting Denver flight ended up leaving late, but arriving on time. At the baggage claim, no suitcase! All of us from traveling from Branson didn't get our suitcases loaded on the Denver plane. There were no attendants at the SLC airport and we had to wait 1/2 hour before even getting any help. By this time it was 1.30 in the morning. My bag had my computer cord I need for work and the bag wasn't delivered until 8.30 pm the next day. I'll avoid Frontier whenever I can. Also, when I called, couldn't get hold of a real person except for the buying a ticket part."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cancun,June 2021,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  Absolutely horrible experience. You are not able to do early check in on your phone before getting to the airport therefore, you will definetly be met with a massive line. Our line to Mexico was about 1 hr but out line leaving Mexico was about 2.5 hrs. The worst thing was the line was growing so they opened a new line but let about 100 people (that were in back of us) into this new line so people who were in back of line were now ahead of us! The guy who opened the new line seemed to enjoy making everyone upset. Our flight was delayed 3xs ending up being 3 hrs and found out it was because plane had mechanical issues (system going blank and ground lights not working) then when we landed sat in plane for 45 min because they gave our hanger to another plane. The seats don't recline and no snack or drinks. Overall horrible. A would be 3. 5 hr flight with normal check in would of been half a day of travel. This ended up being a full day from 9am to 8pm. Stay clear I think they will sell out at some point. They are over booking with customer service and amenities slashed. We saw a couple crying in another lane as probably going to miss flight. This picture below is before it even got worse"

Imagine flying with this airline and trying to get to your destination at a timely manner. The people at the front desk were so useless at their jobs that they ended up delaying me, costing me the chance to check into my original flight and instead I had to take up a 2nd flight [which would put be back most of the day] Don't pick this airline at all if you wanna get to your destination at all or in a timely fashion."
✅ Trip Verified ,airdus,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Portland ,June 2021,4.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,3,"  Frontier is cheap. No doubt about it. However that comes at a cost. First, there was a attendant on the flight that was nodding out during take off and half way through the flight, pupils like pin pricks. Second, I had to reschedule my return flight. I attempted to do this online. Three unsuccessful untempts I try the phone. After 30 min of waiting I get connected to a woman who spoke very little comprehendible English. After a frustrating 20 min on the phone trying to understand what she was saying I asked for someone whos primary language is english. She informed me she was speaking perfect english and continued on. I asked for supervisor, Supervisor called me back after 15 min and informed me of the cost of 236$ to move my flight to Thursday from Wednesday. I advised him of the before mentioned attendant being under some sort of intoxication and informed him after dealing with all of this I wish to just cancel the flight and take my money back assuring him I will never fly with them again. He told me I will be charged a cancelation fee and receive my money back in the form of frontier miles. then hung up on me. Never again, I'll pay the extra for a ticket with another line. "

Worst airline ever! The luggage cost was ridiculous. Our flight was almost 5 hours and we did not even get a glass of water and they said it was because of COVID. However we flew Delta on the way to Orlando and we had full beverage service. If you did want water on Frontier you had to pay 2.99 for a bottle. Seats were the worst and the flight attendants were not pleasant at all. Clearly, they didn’t want to be flying on Frontier either. Without a doubt the worst flight experience I have ever had."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Denver,May 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, I unfortunately had to cancel my flight plans due to an unfortunate circumstance with family. I completely understand the cancellation policy by Frontier however my concern is the extreme lack of forgiveness from Frontier's policy. I decided to try Frontier for my first time in many years and bought the Den membership for $60 along with my flights. Total was $193 and cancelling them cost $120 + the $60 membership (which I couldn't get refunded even though I never used it) leaving me with 13 dollars credit. I wasn't looking for my money back and even thought maybe just giving one of the $60 cancellations as credit to be used for future flights would be good middle ground. Customer service was pleasant but had no power when it came to keeping customer relations. Due to this I will be going out of my way to avoid using Frontier in my future plans.

We waited in this line for 2 hours for tickets to get up to the counter to be told that we have to rebook for the next day! Was so unorganized and we were disgusted with their staff. I missed a whole day of work and couldn't get home to see my kid! We had to spend an extra $200 to get a hotel! Plus food for a whole day and night! Plus all the other money I lost not going to work!

Seats are horrible, no food, no video entertainment and they make money by charging you for luggage when I was told it would be free. Also had to check in my firearm through TSA took it through but it didn’t get to the office, they put my luggage with everyone else luggage which shows they don’t pay attention to safety because it should of been put in frontier head quarters safety room, also they don’t pay their customers any mind, they were focus on conversating with the employees."

I've flown for thirty years now and I can not believe the unprofessionalism of this airline. We booked a single passenger flight months ago to fly from Sacramento, CA to Cleveland, OH. Less than twenty-four hours until lift off we learn that the first portion of this trip was delayed nine whole hours and our connecting flight could no longer be met. Been on the phone for over an hour and can't find a single representative who will work with us unless we shell out more money. A simple google search clearly shows flights still available which would bring us from point A to B tomorrow but Frontier will not let us transfer unless we pay another $100 on top of what we already gave them when we first bought the ticket. Disgusting, I've never had an airline demand more money to fix an unexpected flight change especially when the only luggage involved in a single carry-on. "

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Atlanta,May 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They’re cheap for a reason. Customer service is an absolute nightmare! We get to the airport, the kiosk tells us we have to go to the counter to print the boarding passes. We wait over 30 minutes in line- while people are already yelling at the employees behind the counter- just to get told the gate is closed (what gate closes over 2 hours early?!?!). When we ask the manager,  how can this be and why isn’t it on the itinerary, he calls over the next customer and proceeds to motion to us to shoo. Even his employees said they don’t know why he’s acting like this. He ends up printing us a boarding pass and tells us to go see if there’s any seats left. We get to security and they reassure us that the plane won’t leave without us or a rep will come over and try to rebook us, as there’s 2 more people on the same flight stuck at security. We finally get to the gate and they tell us that the flight has already left. We call customer service in hopes to get compensation, only to get told no. They can only refund the ticket. Nothing for the inconvenience or the fact that now we have to find somewhere to lodge."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Phoenix,May 2021,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,  I had the most wonderful experience on Frontier Airlines flight 2823 from Colorado Springs to Phoenix. There was an African American female flight attendant who was absolutely delightful. She was extremely nice and absolutely hilarious. She deserves a reward for her excellence at her job. I’ll definitely fly Frontier again in the future.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Cleveland,May 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  You’re better off walking wherever you’re headed, barefoot. Unorganized, uncommunicative and late without apology. Flight to Cleveland people were waived off at the entry because it was a flight to Iceland. Gate said Cleveland, all agents were confused. 1 hour late due to who knows what. On the return flight to Tampa there was a young child in extreme duress screeching, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God for 4 minutes. This young Mother, on Mother’s Day was offered no assistance. The mechanical delay resulted in 9 additional people added to the flight. I took the opportunity to deboard and pay full fare on a real airline to get home. If I could have rated zero stars I would. Truly, this was the last, Frontier. Walk or stay home. Horrific experience!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Phoenix ,May 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked my flight on the 27th of April, and wanted to cancel my reservation because we ended up renting a car for our trip. The website didnt work at all to cancel, so I had to call. Let me just say, their ""first time"" policy to charge $39 per person 59-7 days, 60+ days ahead is free and you can only get it free if you purchased your tickets through their WORKS program. Long story short, these people are very money hungry and dont care at all what your situation is. Please read the reviews before you book with Frontier. The cheap ticket comes with all the hidden fee they dont tell you about if you dont read their policy."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Philadelphia,April 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,  Flight attendant was rude and slapped my leg to get my attention instead of being polite. She also refused to let me help my toddler use the restroom and expected me to leave my 4-month-old baby on the seat 18 rows back so I could go into the restroom with my 3-year-old. Reaching out to their customer service was a waste of time. They are not family friendly and do not care about passengers.
✅ Trip Verified ,2374,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,"Philadelphia, PA to Tampa, FL",April 2021,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Never in my life have I ever felt this compelled to make several reviews in different sites to speak out about my terrible service! They nickel and dime you, it is absolutely not worth it. If I can give 0 stars and never ever experience this company ever again I will. This was those terrible life lessons that taught me to pay good money upfront to avoid secret fees and hassles. Bottom line, you will end up paying far more than what you were trying to avoid paying. Also for us to be in a pandemic and shoved like sardines next to strangers with no way to really social distance was crazy. How are you going to enforce masks but not all the other rules. Also my friend flew down to meet me and used Delta and his experience was different, they actually gave people space in between strangers for safety measures, something Frontier did not care to do because they are about milking as many people as possible than people's health and safety. Their seats are super uncomfortable. Also unless your bag is a purse you're gonna pay for it. I will absolutely warn everyone and make sure everyone who will travel in the future never uses this company."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Myrtle Beach, SC to Denver, CO",April 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Traveling for the first time with our newborn. Upon arrival they told us the flight was pretty empty so we were happy as we didn’t have to worry if our child was crying. While trying to board, the man checking our tickets did not see our stroller had a tag and proceeded to sigh and say “how did you not put a tag on stroller jeez”. After boarding the plane, the stewardess, proceeded to yell at me in front of other passengers, my wife and child for putting my carry on bag in the above compartment which see insisted was too big. This bag had my child medication in case of an emergency and I tried expressing this to the stewardess and she said it doesn’t matter. You can check it or I’ll throw you off this plane. Again, this is our first time flying with our newborn child during a pandemic in an semi empty plane. Our stress was at an all time high. There was also another young gentlemen who was moved to the front after this happened and allowed him to put his huge bags directly in our spots to spite us and laughed about. As a man in business, the way you talk to and treat a customer is everything, especially in front of others. Many people told me I can’t believe the way she spoke to you and your family. We will not be flying with Frontier again and are looking for a different flight for the way home. To top it all off the stewardess parents were sitting right in front of us and proceeded to move them to an empty area of the plane because she said you don’t need to be by a crying baby, this was what really broke our hearts. Flight 617 from Myrtle beach SC to Denver CO."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Denver,April 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Will never fly Frontier again. Starting with the prepaid baggage fee of $47 for one checked bag, then the rude flight attendant who upon boarding asked that I pull up my face mask which was covering both my nose and mouth, and then asked again mid flight while I was eating a snack that I brought because of course they don't give away anything for free. The only option of any refreshments was a $3.99 water. If you would like to charge your phone or anything else do it before boarding, frontier doesn't provide that either. The seats are horribly uncomfortable, they do not recline and are nothing but hard plastic covered with vinyl. This was a full flight coming back from Cancun to Denver (4 hour flight), the front bathrooms were not working so everyone was lined up for the rear bathrooms even the captain had to make the walk to the back for the restroom. The flight attendant that was making the announcements was horrible, not only could you not understand most of what was being said,. When the captain spoke he was clear and easily understood. Every time she would speak you could hear many people saying ""what language is she speaking"", ""is she underwater"", ""is she covering up the mic"", ""whats wrong with this woman""."

Late to get moving, all flight attendants were giving different passengers different answer to questions. I paid extra for the perks package and don't understand what value I got.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver via Wichita,April 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Didn’t honor a refund. I wasn’t able to get my bags checked due to the extremely long lines, so I missed my flight. They didn’t have anything else going out until Thursday. Ended up paying over $500 for another ticket on American flight. Frontier will not comp any future tickets or give me a refund, horrible customer service."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Orange County via Denver,April 2021,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I wrote a letter to Frontier about how their customer service manager at Denver airport lacks the personality and sympathy for people who have been traveling and waiting at airports for half a day. Also if they are going to change gates on travelers, don't depend on a muffled airport loud speaker to notify travelers of something as important as gate changes. Use the monitor at the gate to notify us of important changes. Other reviewers are correct, based on the customer service manager who handled our situation, Frontier really couldn't care less if their travelers spend the night at the airport. Which we did. Frontier's letter to us stated that they came up ""a bit short"" on handling our flight with them. Using the words ""a bit short"" after they changed gates on us without adequate notice is like saying someone on a hunger strike is ""a bit hungry"". That letter truly shows they have no clue on how to work with the public. Nor do they really care. Well maybe ""just a bit"". Now is the time to use social media to voice our dismay on this airline."

I was given a refund for the departure flight. When I received my confirmation for the return flight I call Frontier to let them know I tested positive for covid and I didn’t even need the flight due to me never boarding my departure flight. No refund, rude customer service and I am sure they never alerted all the other passengers that they had been exposed to covid."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Denver via Dallas,June 2020,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst experience ever. I bought a ticket from Miami to Dallas, and to my surprise it changed 2 days later from a 3 hour trip to a 13 hour trip. I had to spend the night in Denver. I called customer service to let them know of this problem and the girl on the phone told me changes happen and that the only none stop flights were the day before or after my scheduled trip. At this point I can trust those flights wont change either. She became very flustered and rude and started yelling at me. So I asked to speak to her manager and said the manager couldn't do anything and that if i wanted to speak to the it was an hour wait. The most you can do at this point is make sure you pay for insurance although i doubt Frontier will accept it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Orlando,April 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown. They had 2 delayed (which was almost 2 hours) and left early and did not have courtesy to even announce it.They just said wait, which cost me a lot of money because I missed work time and had to pay for other options as we were stuck in Orlando because the next flight to STT was Friday April 9th which that would’ve been the day we return from St Thomas. (But we never made it there) The chairs are literally chairs; they do not recline at all; they charge $60 for any type of baggage; and do not even give water. None of customer service people are helpful. We have been calling around talking to manager after manager to get our luggage apparently our luggage’s made it to St Thomas but we didn’t. Now I was told by another manager from RDU that they don’t scan their bags in and it’s not showing up in their system that he’s in St Thomas. (Which the manager I spoke with in Orlando said they on the way to ST Thomas.) Moral of the story frontier might be cheap but it’s not worth all these headaches with my luggage and frontier holding there self accountable for their action when they missed up and not even trying to fix the problem. This was my first trip and last with frontier. Now we don’t live in Raleigh so when our luggage is found they will have to send it to us in Virginia. This has been a horrible trip and experience flying with frontier I would not recommend them!"

You have to pay for a carry on which is insane, they basically told us they can do nothing and we’re out of luck, I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone."

Well I chose Frontier because the initial rate was so good for last minute. However, I have not even got on the plane yet and have had to already add a small fortune onto the ""cheapest rate"" and I still have to pay for wifi on the plane! My final cost for this 1 flight is ridiculous. When I check the site to see what is included. All they say is ""no we don't do that so that we can pass along the cheapest rate for you"". Foolish if you ask me. Foolish of me to think I was getting a deal!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Denver,April 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Absolutely horrible! The employees were nowhere to be found! We weren’t late they just didn’t bother to show up! Got told about other flights that didn’t exist! All of the other airlines were helpful and kept having to page Frontier employees to the check in desk. Finally, we got our flight rebooked (no employee could help us get to our original flight) not even by a Frontier employee! Ridiculous! When we called customer service and asked for the supervisor she simply said “I understand, there’s nothing I can do.” So I had to change my flight and rentals and housing and I have to stay at another hotel with the money that I do not have! Never again will I fly with Frontier and neither should any of you."

The attendant said was too big and forced me to pay for extra bag. I tried arguing that was in the right sizes of my ticket but the table he used was the regular one 22""x16x10. And that downstairs it worked just fine. He got very upset and no talk was possible the value was $110 for my and my husband's bags. I thought was ok to pay and then today call and explain the incident and get a refund or credit. For my shock, nothing could be done. The lady in the phone said: No refund or credit even if I have proof my carry on was the right size. So careful guys because if they decide change the rules at the gate and make you pay more you have no rights to fight about there or at the phone later. My original tickets $85 dollars. What I paid? $370. After all they only want give me a voucher with less then half what I paid at the gate valid for 6 months. "

The flight was cancelled as of today, April 1st, and there is not another flight available on that date between the two cities. I accept that. What I can't accept is that the ticket is non-refundable but the airline cancelled it and not me - and they are only giving me a one year voucher for future travel instead of a refund. How is that an incentive to ever book a Frontier flight again?"

And the lady took the person infront of mines bag. But told me it had hit 45ims before the flight and I couldn't check my bags. So they rebooked us (thank goodness we bought the insurance) 12 hrs later. So we chopped it up and dealt with it. Made our next flight. Got to LAX, fast forward 6 days. We get to the Frontier bag check about 55 minutes before our flight. And it was No one there. So 2nd flight missed. We pay $59 each to switch it but didn't know she switched it to another airport.

They also told me that there would be no restrictions on those points. Since then I have tried using those points and I tried to book a flight to Pittsburgh from Charlotte North Carolina and I could only get that date if I paid money they wouldn’t allow me to use points. I would not recommend Frontier Airlines for anything. Actually I have tried several times to book with points and no flights were available.

No intercom. They said we might have a chance to go to boarding, he did not check our bags so we got to boarding they told us we had to go back to check bags. We missed the flight, they said next flight was the next day. Customer service was horrible no care and no compassion. Gave us a number to call for refund, talk to about three people two were supervisors who told me there was nothing they can do and they did not give refund nor make any accommodations nothing. Frontier Airlines customer service is horrible, the worst customer service I’ve ever had. Would not recommend this airline to no one. When things go wrong they will keep your money."

So I didn’t take the flight I booked with Southwest for a flight that left Atlanta Airport @9:45 with a layover In Baltimore getting me back home to Buffalo a hour before my original flight. I called Frontier asking them maybe is it a way they can accommodate the situation being as though they wanted me to sit in a Airport for 24hrs and basically they offered all they could I choose not to take the flight.

My first flight (March 12) went fine, although checking in online was a pain because their website insists you purchase more things. Getting home from Denver has been a disaster because of Frontier. They canceled my flights two days in a row and charged me more money each time to get a new one. Today (Tuesday March 16) I was supposed to fly out at 6 am but got texts and emails saying the flight was delayed until 7:30, then 7:55. So I wait at the gate and miss the flight because they boarded at 6:30 and left. Their customer service reps were very rude from the start and couldn’t be bothered to care.

I felt like I was being transported in a cattle car. The stewardess/stewards walked up and down aisles making sure passengers mask were correctly on. They gave a passenger a penalty card because his mask dropped below his nose. Pricewise they are cheap, but you get what you pay for. I upgraded my seat and paid $100 more, but got the same seating and treatment as every other passenger. The only reason I would ever fly Frontier again would be out of desperation."

I was on the phone for over an hour and a half just trying to get an issue resolved. I initially booked a flight on my app and when it was time to fill out the pay portion the app said it timed out and didn't go through. I then went online to book it again and the second time it went through. When I was ready to confirm the flight I checked the app and realized it double booked the flight, I called within minutes of finding out and got the run around. Because I didn't purchase ""the works"" bundle when booking it they wouldn't refund me the money. As if I would intentionally double book and spend double the money for the same flight. I spoke with two managers and a customer service rep. I ended the conversation with a manager, I expressed my concerns and told her how great it's been up to this point and still couldn't refund me for the same flight. I will definitely tell everyone I know not to fly with them, and definitely don't recommend the customer service they provide."

When we arrived the plane was already shut and headed to the runway. When the Frontier employee came out of the walkway we were obviously in shock and asked for them to let us on, her response “well what time is it?” The most unprofessional airline I have ever flown. After purchasing a $400 one way flight to Las Vegas the Frontier customer service said the flight left 9 minutes early. When we asked for a refund they said “there’s nothing we can do, our airline is non refundable.” Talked with 4 different people and all they can say is the airline is non refundable.

I requested this refund within the 24 hour time frame. The agent acted to be very helpful by canceling my Expedia reservation (which I could have done myself and gotten a full refund). She said she was going to just rebook the trip and start over. Well she did rebook but used my Expedia credit and it ended up costing the same amount as what I canceled! She put the remainder of leftover funds on Frontier credit. I wanted Expedia cancelled which would have been full credit card refund but instead I ended up with saving no money and she put the remainder of the balance on a Frontier credit! She totally lied to me and ripped me off. I called back to talk to a supervisor who stated he could not do anything for me. Buyer beware! In this case better to go through Expedia and cancel and rebook yourself or you will not be get any credit card credit but instead Frontier credit! What a scam!
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,January 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Due to Covid-19, I had to cancel a flight back in April 2020. Frontier would not give me a full refund and instead offered me miles that did not expire - ok, fine. I go to book a flight and realize that if you want to use your miles, you have to pay a miles redemption fee. The fee was the same price as the flight - $75! This was never addressed or discussed when I asked about a refund. I call up customer service and explain my story and the representative transferred me to someone else because he couldn't help me. Spoke to another representative and she basically told me there is no way to waive the fee. In order for there to be a $0 fee is if you book 6 months in advance. Who, especially in these times, plans a trip 6 months in advance? What if I had a family emergency and need to travel pretty immediately? I ended up speaking to 3 different people and all 3 refused to escalate my call to management. Terrible customer support. This is just another way to weasel people out of there money with unnecessary fees. Whenever I use my miles will probably be the last time I fly Frontier."

The line to check in was so long that by the time I finally made it to check in I was told that it was too late and that I would have to catch the next flight at 6AM. We were a family of 7 and they told us we would all be flying back at 6. I noticed that not only was 3 peoples flight were not at 6 but at 2:30 and they had all 3 sitting in separate seats including a 5 yr old child! We call to change our flight and we were told we had to pay over $600 for an error the airline committed on their end. Worse airline ever! Will never fly with them again.

I had to fly out another day which caused havoc on my vacation plans. I had already purchased a rental car, booked excursions and booked 5 hotels for my 7 day vacation throughout Arizona. I had to pay fees to make changes, the excursions were $50.00 each to change the date, the rental car increased the price and 3 of the 5 hotels charged me a fee to change the dates. I contacted Frontier explaining that I should not be the one to incur the cost from something they did. The representative was extremely rude to me and said ""well you can cancel but you will be charged the normal cancelation fees for doing so"". I will never fly Frontier again. I have spoken to others who have had their flights changed as well. I don't see how they can just cancel a flight when people who have purchased the ticket have made arrangements that are non refundable and not offer any sort of compensation for the cost the customer has incurred."

We paid up for a front seat to accommodate our 6'3"" daughter. After sitting in her assigned seat, a dad behind her asked the flight attendant to make her move, so he could sit next to his kids. Mind you, not toddlers..our daughter dutifully complied with the flight attendants instructions, even though a premium was paid for the roomier seat. Upon reaching out to Frontier customer service, only to learn it's a call center outside the U.S. After 60 minutes and asking to speak to a supervisor, I was transferred 3 times, with the same female individual claiming to be a different person each time. When I checked her on it and asked to be transferred to someone in the U.S. she hung up on me. Frontier wasn't even willing to refund the upcharge we paid for the seat. Simply, we were charged for a service that wasn't provided yet, this ""dad"" who used the flight attendant to get a premium seat without paying, never again.

Also, they was additional air conditioning issues and when I looked outside the window they were still tampering with the engine; something was up. Never will trust this airline. No leg room either.

I am flying to Denver to see my son on Friday. Today he informed me that he had COVID-19. When I called the reservation representative, I was told that it would be $98 to change my flight. I therefore am assuming that it is acceptable to fly on Frontier even if I may be exposed to COVID-19. After some thought, I’ve decided to go ahead and fly on my original flight that leaves on Friday and come back on the following Thursday. I would like to thank the Frontier corporation to being so open to the idea that COVID is not as dangerous as we were lead to believe. See you Friday!"

The only communication I received after purchasing my ticket and paying my baggage fee was an option to change my flight to a more distant departure and arrival city which I did not want. I show up at the airport only to find myself stuck and having to walk around looking for another way home. I ended up purchasing a ticket with Delta having to pay another $100 on top of what I paid Frontier. Frontier only offered a refund. Thanks for nothing.

They have no empathy for what's going on in the world with a pandemic and beware of the flexible book and waving fees, its a lie! Luckily the flight was only $50 and not worth the headache of the back and forth. Do yourself a favor and book with Delta or American Airlines, just not Frontier. They're just as bad as Spirit."

Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher will not be allowed to fly. •You will wear a face covering over your nose and mouth throughout your journey, including ticket counters, gate areas, and onboard our aircraft. •In the last 14 days, neither you, nor anyone in your household or that you have come in close contact with, has tested positive for, exhibited symptoms of, or been advised to quarantine for COVID-19. •You will wash your hands/sanitize before boarding the flight. I could not accept their health acknowledgment due to being exposed to Covid and having symptoms. I called Frontier on October 19, 2020 to express my concerns of which I was told to call back within 24 hours or on Thursday before flight to receive a refund or credit. I called as instructed on October 22, 2020 to cancel in order that I may receive a credit or refund. He said I would not be able to board the plane due to my situation. I called Frontier on October 22, 2020 only to be told I would be charged cancellation fees totaling some $238.00, that I did not speak to anyone on October 19, 2020, and there was nothing I could do about it. I sent phone records indicating my calls, explaining my situation, requesting a credit meaning I am still paying. I attempted multiple calls and filled out forms online. Remember, it is their policy and not mine. They told me I would need a doctor's signature on hospital or doctor's office letterhead. There is nothing in Frontier’s Quick & Easy Health Acknowledgement about a doctor, a hospital, an anything. It simply indicates I have to accept the following acknowledgment of which I could not do unless I where to lie. I was also accused of not making phone call on October 19, 2020. I sent them my phone records of which they never addressed in conversation. I was assessed a cancellation fee of $238.00 due to their policy not allowing me to board plane, will never fly Frontier; therefore, they lose future business, and I am telling my story to anyone who wants to know about Frontier customer service. By the way, do your homework, and you will quickly learn Frontier is the worst overall airline to fly. It seems they have desire to keep that reputation. I could have easily lied and continued on with my trip. I tried to do the right thing. I tried to be proactive in helping Frontier out as early as possible. Cheaper is not always better."

I end up needing cancel that flight and they ask if I want a whole airline credit or the credit from before and the refund to my CC back to my CC. SO I advise them, yes, I would like that $45 back to my Credit card. I end the phone call that I’ve been on hold for about 30 minutes and get an email saying they did an airline credit? There were no. other. options. but to use that full airline credit that THEY mistaken for the airline credit from before and the $45 from my CREDIT CARD. So I use the credit. I call to cancel the second flight I book and they can’t refund me even if it was their fault for not crediting my Credit Card? Make it make sense. I speak to the “manager” and she continues telling me it was my fault?! Their customer service sucks. You really do get what you pay for. Do not use Frontier. I still don’t get my money back."

No refund, only a credit and it had to be used within 90 days! Other airlines either did refunds or allowed the credit to go through the end of 2021 (e.g. American). Not Frontier! Booking a new trip in the middle of a pandemic is crazy. Despite an appeal to extend the credit, none was given. Frontier would rather keep my money than have be back as a customer. I hope this kind of treatment leads them to go out of business. I would do a rating of zero if I could."

I tried to remove the 2nd ticket added, was unable to do so. I decided to cancel the transaction and call the airline directly. In cancelling the cart items, the transaction cancelled my original flight I had paid for 3 weeks prior. I panicked and called the airline within 3 minutes and was told there was nothing they could do for me, I wrongly cancelled the transaction and it was my fault. The costs roundtrip of the seat and baggage fees should have been $122.00, but the cart cost was $282.00. In other words, the site added the cost of a second ticket to the cart. The cost of my ticket was kept as a cancellation fee with no refund. In other words, I don't get to fly to see my grandchildren and I am out the cost of the ticket as well from a glitch on their website. This is nothing short of stealing."

I am well aware it is a discount airline with ""discount"" seats and amenities. The issue was with them canceling my return flight and then not refunding my ticket or reimbursing me for the new ticket I had to purchase to get home on time. They offered another flight the next day but didn't tell me until 41 minutes after the flight left (proven with emails). Either way, flying the next day was not an option. Even if I could fly the next day, they were not going to pay for accommodations for the extra night. Their response to all this is ""We gave you a flight home."" end of story. I tried explaining that I had to be home the day I was originally traveling and they basically told me that was not their problem. So No Refund on the canceled flight and No Reimbursement on the out of pocket to get home."

We booked a flight for April 8th to visit our grandson and family in Florida. Obviously we cancelled due to covid-19. They then cancelled the flight I assume, as no one was flying at that time. We tried to book a flight to visit them for November and they told us our credit was expired. We talked to several people at the airline - the last one being a manager. I also communicated twice in an email. I was told no exceptions. We are seniors and can't really afford to repay $474 for flights (as I'm sure most people can't do). I can not believe that under the circumstances of covid they are not honoring the credit. They say they must be booked within 90 days. Who is going to book a flight to Florida in June? That is the last thing on anyone's mind. I see many other people are in the same position. We feel it is disgraceful! They are the cheapest flights but not when you are paying twice. We will probably have to drive which is 16 hours or drive half way and fly. I flew with the airline many times to go to Charlotte and Florida to see grandkids but will never fly again with that airline! By the way, every other airline is extending credit due to covid!"

I fly this airline when I need to visit family, use their credit card and belong to their Den Club. I have stopped flying because of COVID. Earlier this summer a family wedding canceled and I was given a voucher for 1.200 for flights I had to cancel due to COVID, this was after they took away nearly $500 in penalty fees during a pandemic. Today, I tried to use the voucher to fly home for a family funeral. I was told it had expired. I spent 2 hours on the phone speaking to 4 different individuals who spoke very broken English and I had great difficulty understanding them. I explained my situation and was repeatedly told, ""So sorry, we are not able to help you, your voucher has expired."" One woman even blamed me for forfeiting my voucher. I can't even begin to explain how incompetent each person I spoke to was...even the supposed manager. In the end, no resolution. They stole nearly 1,700 dollars from me during a pandemic! They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of people during a national crisis. I looked it up today and Frontier was given a fair share of the $25 billion in recovery money for COVID and they are stealing what amounts to two weeks + of pay from a US citizen who is trying to make ends meet. Their airplanes are uncomfortable, they offer nothing and nickle and dime you for everything from a carry on bag to a beverage. Frontier Airlines should not be patronized by the working class people of our country. They don't care and they have 0 compassion for their customers."

When I went to do online check in for Frontier there were no seats for me to select unless I paid additional money.

I could buy a cheap bottled water for $2.99. My trip to Omaha cost me $38.00 plus $10.10 for taxes on United, included everything - free! My trip back to Denver cost me $ 28.00 plus $10.10 for taxes (?) plus $46 for a carry on plus $29.00 for a seat (didn't want to ride on the wing) for a total of $123.10.

I’m supposed to be flying with my daughter this week to visit a friend who desperately needs us. I just found out her and her family are sick, likely with COVID-19. We are having to postpone our trip. I was hoping Frontier would be understanding of this. I don’t want to fly with another airline. I simply wanted to push the flight back a week or two until it would be safe to travel again. Out of 5 different supposed supervisors/managers I talked to every single one told me there’s absolutely nothing they can or will do to waive the change fees right now. They simply wanted to cancel my flight and refund me only $100ish out of the almost $450 I paid. One manager asked how I was and I said “Not very good” and his reply was “That sounds great...so here’s the thing” Seriously. I asked if they would prefer for me to go through with the trip, potentially be exposed to COVID and travel back on the airplane, exposing an entire plane full of customers and staff. He informed me my risk of exposing everyone would be low because I’d be wearing a face mask. Every single person claims there is absolutely nothing they can do to change policy, no matter how high you go with the company. They could not care less about the health and satisfaction of their customers or their employees for that matter. All they care about is nickel and diming you, taking your money. I understand I did not purchase The Works package. I understand there are normally change/cancellation fees. What I do not understand is there not being any exception in the midst of a global pandemic. This company should be incredibly ashamed of themselves for having a total lack of compassion and empathy for humankind, their customers, and their employees. I rarely wish ill upon anyone or any company, but I truly hope with everything in me that your company completely goes under if you choose to continue on a path of having zero compassion and empathy. You can take my money this time. I’ve learned my lesson. I don’t care if you offered a lifetime of free airfare right now. I will never again make the horrible mistake of flying with or paying another penny to your sorry excuse for a business. I’ll pay whatever it takes to fly through an airline that will actually take care of and care about their customers. To the employees of this company who are stuck under shoddy management, strict scripts you must adhere to and horrible work conditions, you deserve better. I hope and pray you can find your true worth with another company."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Orlando,May 2020,,,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines is known as a deeply discounted airline. We have flown Frontier a couple of times, and have found the customer service to be non-existent, the seats to be terribly uncomfortable, and very cramped. Our family flew across the country on an overnight flight, and the cabin crew were very loud in the back, laughing and carrying on all night. There was no consideration for the passengers. None of us (including 4 young children) were able to even doze at all, even though it was the middle of the night. At that time I swore that I would never put my family through that again. However, when the opportunity arrived to take my family across the country again, I stupidly relented when the flight prices were so cheap. I told myself I could endure because the price was low. Come COVID-19. Our plans were cancelled, the world was in a mess. We were out of jobs, and our event in Florida was cancelled. I cancelled my flight with Frontier, assured that I would get my more than $800 full credit fur use within 90 days. 90 days? Who is going to be able to travel within 90 days? Travel restrictions abound, and I am a nurse. I am unable to leave the state or I will not be able to come back to work. So where am I going to go? I didn’t know what to do. Later, I got an email that stated in the subject line (exact words) ”Now use your travel credit to book through 9/12/21.” And the first thing in the body of the email was “Schedule extension! Now book through September 12, 2021.” There was nothing in the email to differentiate when the travel actually had to be booked vs. travel. I honestly thought it was a booking extension until Sept 12, 2021. I was relieved because I thought that Frontier was finally coming to its senses and following industry standards for issuing credits good for more than 90 days. However, when I tried to use my credit today, I was denied on the basis that it had expired by nearly 3 months and I was just out of luck. I was on the phone for one hour and forty two minutes and the answer was always “policy is policy.” Frontier sent out a (deliberately?) misleading email and now is keeping my $800+. They have stolen my money. I did my due diligence to try to use this within the time frame that I thought was given to me. The fact that Frontier just does not care and has no qualms about stealing $800 from well-meaning customers, tells me that it is a company not worth dealing with ever again. Beware of this company. Their good prices are not worth the discomfort, bad service, and all- around dishonesty. Don’t be fooled as I was."

Not even a day after I cancelled my ticket, Frontier cancelled the flight altogether and issued a full refund for the other passengers. Since no travel is happening right now, my 90 day credit expired. When I inquired about extending it so I could still use them as an airline they informed me that because my cancellation was ""voluntary"" I am not entitled to any sort of extension. They should be extending grace and better communication during this pandemic. I will not fly with them again unless they make it right and refund me my money."

COVID happened and Frontier had to cancel the flight home. They told me they could either provide me with a credit or reschedule the trip. We decided to reschedule the trip. Frontier cancelled the flight again, they rescheduled it, this time with a layover. Annoying, but whatever. Then 2 weeks before the trip, the flight gets cancelled again. I call and ask if they can put me on a new flight. They say the next flight is a day later. This doesn't work for me because I do not have a place to stay for another night. I ask if they can give me a refund. They say they can credit my account. How is account credit going to get me home? I need a refund so I can rebook my flight the day I need to come home. They say they cannot provide a refund back to my direct deposit because apparently I had paid for this trip with a voucher. This trip was rescheduled because they cancelled the initial trip - that's why it was paid for with a voucher. On top of that, they told me a refund to my direct deposit wasn't even an option in the first place and that my only options were to take a voucher or reschedule. I paid an extra $60 for Frontier's ""The Works"" insurance, which is supposed to refund me in case something like this were to happen. Now they're saying that doesn't apply. Now, I do not have a flight home from Mexico, I lost $600, and I don't have the money to pay for a flight home. I didn't get what I paid for, and they refuse to give me my money back.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Las Vegas,August 2020,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I booked my flight for 2 passengers over a month ago to attend a concert in Las Vegas. Due to COVID-19, it was postponed until next year. I ended up moving up our travel times a week to better fit our schedule with our children. The new flights I chose were from CVG to Las Vegas 8/14/20 – 8/17/20 (I even have the screen shot I sent my companion to verify the dates before I hit Confirm Changes. Once I did that, I paid the difference for the changes.  We arrived at the airport almost 2 hours before our flight around 1:44pm local time. It was when we were checking our bag that the attendant noticed our tickets were for the day before 8/16/20. He said it was ok because we were within our 24-hour window and could change the flight to the next morning (6am) at no cost. While he was trying to get the tickets to process, a message kept popping up that wouldn’t allow him to proceed. He said that was weird and brought over a lady to look. She didn’t know why it wasn’t going through either. They both told me that the airline has a 24 hour policy that there is no additional fee for a changed flight and didn’t know why that was happening and both said just to purchase 2 new tickets and call and get the refund the next day when I was home. We were getting close to the plane boarding (and still within the 24 hours) so I agreed to what they told me and paid $454.20 for the 2 tickets and $55.00 for the checked bag. I would have NEVER paid that much for a flight I had already purchased and would have shopped around even if it meant staying an extra day or two as we get free rooms at hotels. We almost missed the flight as well because the lady who sold us the tickets (same one who told us we would get a refund when we called the next day spelled my girlfriends name wrong, even though they had her driver’s license to print the ticket. We had to run back to the desk from security to have her put the correct name on the ticket. Yesterday (8/18/20) I called Frontier and spoke with a lady who was very hard to understand but the part I got out of her was she wouldn’t refund my money and I should have read the companies policies. I told her it was their companies’ employees who should know their own companies’ policies and provide the correct information to their customers. I was calm during all of this and just asked if I could speak to a supervisor. She told me it would be 3 hours after they got off a call and one would call me back. A supervisor, who was even harder to understand, said her name and other things at the beginning of the call but I couldn’t decipher what she was saying. I reiterated my conversation with the last representative, and she kept telling me the same thing and I kept telling her the same thing 2 Frontier employees told me. There were no raised voices or yelling and she hung up on me while I was talking. Under normal circumstances I could understand a policy where they wouldn’t refund tickets due to a missed flight. However when 2 Frontier employees tell me it’s their companies policy not to charge an additional fee for switching flights within a 24 hour period and I’ll get a full refund, that’s where I have an issue.

My son chose to marry in Vegas. I am on medications I couldn’t do without and did not have enough to make it to Thursday.

Spent 3 hours on the phone attempting to request a refund since that is not the flight plan we booked and paid for, but they refused. Now we are stuck with a flight credit that has to be used within 90 days or we lose the money all together. Frontier is the most immoral and unethical business I have ever had to deal with. They are robbing from people who were forced to cancel their flights, who have lost jobs and family because of a pandemic that we have no control over. It’s not right.

On the phone she said she will get my file to the refund department and that it might take some time. Now 4 months later they have emailed me saying my flight credit expired and that I am denied a refund. This email was very confusing as I never requested a flight credit in the first place and find it very upsetting that no one tried to contact me or explain what was going on. So still I am trying to speak with their customer services to understand why I cannot get a refund. Do not book with frontier.

Our trip was cancelled due to the pandemic and they only have 90 days to rebook a flight. But who can do that, as we have no idea if anything would be open and when. Do we buy hotels and risk not being refunded if we have to cancel? We tried numerous times to call the airline and couldn’t get through, and today my husband got through and was told since it was past the 90 days we lost our credit. They could have easily let us book, especially because their customer service is also garbage and we couldn’t get through."

I had to cancel my first flight due to Covid-19, when I tried to re-book online the travel credit did not work over the website. Therefore, I had to re-book over the phone and the agent did not make it clear that if I didn't use the entire credit on this one phone call I would completely loose the remainder of the money I had already spent!! When I called back later explaining the situation (that I was supposed to have $320 left over) they refused to refund my money, I wasn't able to use it in any way, and they wouldn't even let me speak with a supervisor or manager. The agent even hung up on me at the end of the call. On top of that, every agent on the phone has had a thick accent and has been hard to understand so that doesn't help. The way I see it, they've stolen $320 from me and they refuse to make it right, even when I was told by their representative that I would be able to use this money in the future.

I had scanned my ticket at the security check point, so they knew I was at the airport. What happened is that I was at the wrong terminal. I had flown frontier several times and assumed I was in the right terminal, but they had transferred to a different place. I ran as fast as I could and arrive at the gate at 9:25 and was denied boarding because they close the gate 3 min earlier -  the staff probably wanted to go home and didn't bother to wait and I had checked in. When calling the support they said they couldn't do anything because it was a 'No Show' even I telling the entire story. Never  again I will fly with this disgusting company. "

In those 90 days my family members got infected with COVID and I couldn't call the company to rebook my flight I had clearly other priorities in my life. The expiration date was June 20th. When I called on July 4th they said I had lost my money $1,605. How can a company be so unhearted and not understand that from March till today our lives have been flipped upside down!! Our country is still struggling with the wave of disaster of this virus yet Frontier is seating very relax just taking people's money away in a time like this. If they wanted to help they would had but they didn't. If they wanted to help they would had refunded the money from the beginning and not deal with expiration dates but they didn't.

I am from the Netherlands, Europe and I am still not allowed to enter the USA because of covid-19. So when I got a email (below) yesterday from Frontier with my name and booking number and that I could cancel my flight and I would keep the full amount of my tickets for new tickets I did.

I had originally purchased 5 nonstop round trip flights max 4 hours from NY to Cancun I have kids. They have now been changed to Philadelphia airport because there is no availability in NY on my departure date. The rep even wanted me to pay 200/ticket difference. The times have changed multiple times and are now connecting from Philadelphia to Denver back to Cancun not to mention these are overnight flights. The date of my arrivals have changed completely. They do not want to give me my money back. I would run far far away from this company.

That day couldn't get through phone system just shut me off and said that call volume was too high. After many failed attempts I finally got through after 5 days and was told they couldn't extend because it was expired and they would not renew. Now this is a service I paid for and did not get but they don't care. They have zero care for customers as I'm not the only one with this exact same issue.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Atlanta,July 2019,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I have three issues with Frontier airlines. The first is that when I was exposed to COVID a few days before a flight, they would not issue a full refund to my card despite the unique circumstances the virus has created so I was forced to lose several hundred dollars and cancel a flight. Also they gave me a partial refund and held what they did give me so I had to use it at Frontier. My second issue is their lack of customer service. When I did try to use the funds for another flight, they charged my card for the flight I booked but their website bugged out and I received no confirmation about my flight besides my card being charged. All of their phones are disable so I had no way of reaching anyone so I had to dig through their website to find a link to file a complaint. It took 2 weeks to get a response from anyone there and all they did was say the bare minimum and send me my confirmation. My final issue is now that I have the flight confirmation 2 weeks after I booked it (remember they immediately charged my card and took my money) its not what I booked. And my flight is in a week. I tried using their website to change the flights but it keeps logging me out and is making it very difficult to change anything without a hard confirmation of what I am actually changing. So now I'm stuck with the flight they decided to give me with absolutely nothing I can do about it because I can't wait 2 weeks to get an email from customer service and can't get anyone on the phone to figure it out. I cannot stand this airline and this whole experience has been a nightmare. I am going to make sure everyone I know hears about this because this is absolutely pathetic."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Diego,November 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Was flying from Orlando to San Diego back in Nov 2019. Boarded the planE and sat on the runway for half an hour while maintenance came to check out an issue. Cool, they are fixing the problem.  Maintenance left and we took off. Cool, they must have fixed the problem and sent us safely on our way. I'm going to sleep.  Wake up 3 hours later to learn that we have been flying in circles over the gulf of Mexico this whole time because the problem wasn't fixed and we needed to burn gas to land back in Orlando. Took them 4 hours to then find us a place to stay, rebook us and provide us with a voucher. Not too cool, but they took care of us a little. The voucher provided required me to book a flight by May 2020. Then COVID hit, and I couldn't plan on traveling anywhere. Surely Frontier would understand this and extend the expiration date of my voucher.  Wrong! It doesn't matter that I literally couldn't plan on booking a trip between February and July, since I didn't use that voucher by May I lost it and Frontier refuses to make it right. We have seen companies do amazing things to ease the impact of this pandemic. Frontier is not one of those companies. If Frontier is one of the airlines that makes it through this, I won't be giving them any more of my business."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Denver,June 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  This is the worst airline ever. It seems like a cheap and good deal, but you will end up paying the same (if not more for another airline). The customer service is so bad that you might as well book with someone else, or risk losing money.  bought a ticket back in February of 2020. The price seemed reasonably low so I bought a ticket. I ended up spending more than I would have spent flying with another airline, after my baggage and seating. I was fine with all of this (my fault for not knowing) but, after March everything got worse. My flight was scheduled in the middle of March right after everything shut down for Covid-19. They said that we could change or cancel our flight for free. First of all, there is no way you can get a refund back onto your card (you can only be given credits to buy another flight). They only gave us 3 months to reschedule our flights, which is very hard to do not knowing when everything will open back up due to corona (Every other airline, gives you at least a year to reschedule). They only had flights scheduled for sunday and thursday. When I finally got in contact with someone, they said that they do flights day by day so more flights may or not be available. I could not fly on those days and by the time they finally would have other flights available, my credits would have expired. On top of that if a flight is more than your past flight you have to pay extra (understandable) but a flight reserved a year in advance should have been that expensive! Secondly a flight that is cheaper than your available credits can not be refunded, so you will still be losing money. I finally decide to reschedule my ticket a week before I lost my credits, and the website didn't work. The line is always busy (sometimes it just beeps and hangs up. It says customer service is open until 12am, but when I called later that day they claimed they were closed. Called the next day, after finally bypassing the robot and talking to a real employee, they hung up in my face before they the line could connect. The next day it asked me to do a survey if I was over 50, when chose the option saying I was not over 50 they hung up in my face. Called again and the same thing happened. Every time I called after that, the wait was over an hour and 30 minutes. I finally talked to someone just for them to say they could do nothing because the site was down (All that time wasted). When I finally did talk to someone who could help, they made me try to book a new flight over 3 times (on my end) before they finally told me they would do it from their end with no $25 fee. My boyfriend tried to do the same, but they keep telling him that he has no credits left. He hasn't bought any new flights and he cancelled his old flight a day after me; meaning he should've had a day longer than me to reschedule (according to their 90 day policy). This place is a scam. We've spent over twice as much money than expected. I feel they are trying to make up for the money they lost during quarantine. "

So they were trying to eat up my credit and then make me pay more to book the same flights for the following year. That by itself is wrong . I went to book and saw that I had no miles .. now that is strange since I even have their credit card. I thought possibly I could book and eat up the rest with miles. I called their customer service and sat on hold for over an hour to automatically be transferred to an answering machine. I left my name and number and of course no phone call back. I tried again the next 2 days. Now here I am on the phone again for the 4th time and it has been exactly 1 hour and 12 minutes. I did get a booking agent (of course!) and come to find out I had 2 accounts? All of my miles were on the other account.

For which I again explained that is what I am trying to do but the website is not recognizing my credit, which I previously explained. Upon which we were discounted! I had given her my phone number at the beginning of the call to call me back if we were discounted. Surprise, no call back and I am again holding for a representative.

Frontier knew that they planned on canceling flights but in order to avoid giving passengers a refund, they told us to cancel the flights ourselves. I canceled for the same reason everyone else has been, because of COVID-19. Frontier issued me a credit and said that I have until June 2020 to use. I have no intention of traveling this year and probably not next year. And it is not fair that they get to place these restrictions on customers. I've been on the phone with them for about a month trying to get either a refund or to have that credit expiration date extended to the end of 2021. But they refuse and say that they can't do anything about it. Airlines should not be allowed to get away with this. I understand the current state of the world and that everyone is hurting. But customers shouldn't be exploited and tricked as a result. Now more than ever we need compassion and understanding.

I called customer service and wait on the line for one hour and twenty-five minutes before I get someone. They tell me my reservation isn’t there and I have to rebook online, or they will charge me a fee! At this point I am irate! Why would my itinerary print with my flight info and it not go through? Instead of being charged for a rebooking fee, I go online and the non-stop flights in question are not even available. They were either cancelled or changed. Not just that but the only flights that are available are double what I paid! I call Frontier again and this time wait on the line for one hour and forty-six minutes. The customer service representative tells me that a lot of people who received credits haven’t had success rebooking their flights and that she would waive the rebooking fee. Then proceeds to tell me that they won’t honor my itinerary or prices from my original booking. Four round trip tickets from Nashville to Vegas had originally costs $404.80, they were now going to charge me $828.00 (flights that were non-stop).

When I started to respond to her she hung up on me. Currently on hold again for over 20 minutes so far. Wish me luck."

I woke up this morning to find out my flight for a trip in June has been changed by a day (originally Friday-Monday and now showing Thursday-Sunday). I was shocked to see an airline change a flight by a whole day and then double checked google flights to see if the original flight plan was available; and it was. So I was confused why Frontier would swap me out to a whole new schedule for no reason. I tried calling for 3 hours and finally gave up and read reviews about not receiving any refunds for flights and getting credits for 90 days. With the pandemic going on, I was shocked and scared I'd be done in too and stuck with a $300 flight I couldn't take. I finally called again this afternoon and  I ended up being able to get a full refund for the trip. I wouldn't believe every review! I don't deal with anxiety about finances well and I was totally proven wrong once I was on with a representative. I can't even get a full refund from American Airlines for my trip I cancelled with them but Frontier gave me one."

I have been on the phone with Frontier probably totalling 10 hours trying to get my money returned. Everyone I have spoken to have been completely rude and unwilling to help. From the first time I have spoken with an agent to now, this Covid19 has only worsened and has my husband currently out of work. Which leaves us with little to no money scrambling. The trip was for my 30th birthday and due to an actual pandemic, this was stopped. Your organization is representing heartless tactics and feels like many people are being ripped off. I am currently on hold and wasn’t even informed I was being placed on hold. The agent clearly is frustrated and tired of having to deal with conversations like the one I had with her today. In which is understandable. I will never use Frontier again."

Due to the coronavirus, I had inquired about canceling my flight for safety reasons. They stated to me that they could issue a credit to my account that but would need to book a flight within 90 days. Due to my location Frontier only services my airport Jan-May. I explained that I would not be able to use my credit within 90 days due to the airline not servicing my location. The operator on the other end stated, “not my problem you’ll just have to drive to the next closet airport that we service.” The next closet airport is 7-hours away from where I live, so I am basically out of $450 because I physically cannot book a different flight due to them not servicing my airport. Absolute worst customer service and they are taking advantage of every customer they have. I will never fly with them ever again and I hope anyone reading this chooses a different airline."

The flight was delayed multiple times and ultimately cancelled 30 minutes prior to the original departure time. I understand this can happen with any airline, and has happened to me on other airlines as well. The difference with Frontier was the extreme lack of customer service. I was traveling with a family of 5 with young children and the staff had no regard for this or any compassion for the situation. We were not offered any sort of compensation for the inconvenience and with no assistance from the airline staff, we were able to get on a flight to Cincinnati (~2 hours from home) and rented a car to drive the remainder of the way. Frontier could not switch my luggage over to the new flight, they lost our gate checked stroller somehow, and cost us an additional $100+ with the rental car. I paid the money I ""saved"" with Frontier in rental fees and a new stroller. You may save some money with Frontier and it may work out from time to time, however, if anything goes wrong with the flight do not expect any assistance from the airline or the staff! Horrible experience. Will never fly Frontier again."

I was told that no refunds will be given to anyone and only a credit will be given. I’d have 90 days to book another flight with Frontier or I’m basically out of money paid. The supervisor I talked to on the phone hung up on me and didn’t bother to call back. I am absolutely offended that Frontier does not put the interests and safety of the public ahead of its profit margin. Very poor business practices!

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Chicago,March 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  My husband and I were trying to access our tickets via phone and accidentally ended up canceling out booking from Phoenix to Chicago. What we didn’t realize was this: while most corporations are providing refunds to their clients during this period of fear and uncertainty, Frontier has preyed on and taken advantage of theirs by failing to do so. Because we spent most of our money on booking a flight with Frontier in the first place, having to RE-book another will very likely be the reason we can’t feed our family this month. I am so appalled that Frontier has taken advantage of us like this and that we have lost so much money from a simple user error. I am disappointed that, after trusting this company, it turned out to be so dishonest and parasitic. I would hate for this to happen to anyone else and would strongly discourage any of our friends or family from putting themselves at risk for this same situation by booking with Frontier."

You pay for everything, including a seat (price quoted for a round trip is without a seat, which you need to pay for and if you want to move seats later, pay more again). So, knowing all this, decided to fly again, and now with the Coronavirus hitting, I wanted to delay my flight - the website for Frontier is not user-friendly. I spent hours booking and reviewing and trying to navigate the website - so I wanted to see if they would change my flight to a later date - I went to a page that talked about cancellations, but when I hit the button to go to that page, it was an actual cancellation and no warning, bam, done, lost all but $12 and change for a future trip - rip off - will never, never fly this airline again.

Then when I asked if I could speak to anyone else he stated “ I don’t want to transfer you you’ll just have to call back” . By the end of the call he didn’t even answer the question I had, I always choose Frontier to fly as it has the best service and the best prices but after this phone call and literally being yelled at by someone who is supposed to represent this company I’m not sure if I’ll ever want to fly with them again."

Like others, I was also suspicious about the quality/comfort of this airline's experience. I made my research before our flight (me, wife, and a 5-year-old) and I had mixed reviews, and there was one outstanding blog post that was very helpful (a positive one, I need to refer him, can't find now). First, you are paying cheap so be prepared and mindful about what they are agreed to. so don't act like, ""oh, they stopped me to pay for my cabin-luggage!"". You can't get a better experience with this price in any other airline. This flight from RDU to ATL is the best (I didn't expect them to have entertainments et al here, I didn't pay for them), felt way more comfortable than seats that can be reclined. It is only an hour+ trip though. On-time departure landed earlier than scheduled, technically strong (a bumpy journey due to weather, they aced!). I really enjoyed our trip both ways. I won't ask more! Con: I can't comment if they cancel a trip of ours for any reason and ask you to get refund and take another plan. I would seriously think about this if I am making a serious or important business trip!"

Emailed a cancelled flight 4 hours before it was scheduled to leave. No text or phone call so my people had already headed to the airport. No plan for getting them home at all. Apparently it’s a no re-book airline so you’re on your own if they screw you. No money for a hotel. No plan. Never ever going to fly this airline again!

They lost our $300 car seat that was with our portable high chair in a huge bright red bag .. how do you loose that!? Not only that, they did nothing but submit a claim at the airport, and made us wait (over an hour!) just to tell us they can’t do anything. They didn’t have any car seats for us to use as we’d need to cross back to Canada, didn’t put us up in a hotel for the night. Not worth it. Called the number, all they’re doing is reimbursing us for checking our bag, and they did end up finding our stuff but is only being shipped Monday. Not worth it, will not be flying with Frontier again. Spend a bit more for a better airline. "

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft. Myers to Cleveland,February 2020,1.0,4.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  I am not one to leave a negative review unless it's absolutely terrible. Now, I understand that things happen. Planes, like all technology and mechanics, have issues. But my first flight with Frontier was delayed an hour and I found out from a frequent flier that Frontier is prone to delays all the time. This did not give me much confidence in my return flight home. And with good reason. After waiting in the airport for three additional hours passed my departure due to a mechanical issue, the airline canceled the flight. I believe that definitely could have been determined much sooner and the passengers could have been told earlier (heck we were even told that we would have to wait an additional hour before being able to change flights without additional charge) . We were told to return to the Frontier desk at the airport to book another flight a bit early (ok, cool) - maybe I'll get home tonight after all - only to find out that all of the flights for the following day were booked solid, leaving over a hundred to frantically find their way home. And no, Frontier was not going to add any additional flights. I understand that this could happen with any airline, but this wasn't handled appropriately and now doing my own research with this airline, I've certainly learned that Frontier is an unreliable airline and this happens frequently with their flights. I will not be booking any new flights with this airline and strongly urge others to fly with a different airline. Frontier may be affordable, but you get what you pay for."

Airline is rude and doesn't respect customers and won't acknowledge own mistakes to avoid paying refunds. I know a lot of people write reviews about bad food or not enough leg room or complain about delays.  The real issue is when a flight takes off without being announced, ahead of time, and when confronted the representative reply without a sliver of respect for us customers and the little money we pay that sustain this airline. I flew from CLT through to SFO through Vegas. The first flight was ok. The layover was an hour and that's fine. I was within 1-2 minutes walking distance from my gate and when the flight was taking a bit too long to o board I went to the gate to find 9 other people arguing with the representative at the desk. Turned out the flight left and all of us just didn't have common sense to listen to announcements according to the lady at the desk. She also said we can't get any flight the same day and no refunds. They claimed that they did multiple announcements and that we didn't care to listen. Please do yourself a favor and don't fly Frontier.

Due to lack of professionalism we missed our flight, there was no one at the gate directing anyone to board the plain, no announcements whatsoever. The gate was being shared with two other airlines, when asked around on what to do next I was told to report to the frontier chek-in desk,having to exit all gates just to find myself to an empty table and no one to help me. When calling the company for assistance on what to do next the only option given was to pay a no show fee (although I was at the gate the whole time) and was told to pay $119 fee and the flight difference which was an absurd amount totalling up to over $1,000. I was told there was nothing else that could be done. Of all my past travels I had never been more undervalued as a customer. Wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.

(Meanwhile, I flew to San Diego on American paid the same ticket fare did not have to pay for carry-on and I was late they changed my ticket free of charge and they served beverages). Then I get in the plane ask the flight attendant to please help me just reach overhead to place bag due to my abdominal surgery he literally tells me he’s not supposed to but he will this time, but next time I need to check in this small carry on! What next time never again flying with this disgraceful airline! And they don’t offer beverages! All the attendants did the whole flight was walk up and down with bags collecting trash.

✅ Trip Verified ,Airbus,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chicago,February 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My fiance and I were traveling from Chicago  to Orlando Feb 14th returning to Feb 17th. For starters our flight out was scheduled for 11am, when we arrived to the airport from the shuttle at 8am we were told that the flight was delayed until 1:52pm. I have the app and checked in on my way to the airport in the shuttle and I was not notified of the delay, hence we spent our entire morning / afternoon in the airport. After finally getting on the plane to leave we were told there was technically difficulties with a plane which is why we had to wait for one coming from Vegas, mind you our flight was half full 10 hours before we left because I checked and magically we are in a full flight, which leads me to believe they said screw it and pushed two planes together because there was a couple of different times for departures that day all going to Orlando (obviously caring more about business than there passengers). After arriving at MCO at 5:30pm we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for a good 30 minutes before even having a gate to get unloaded at. We finally got to the baggage claim at 6:15pm (our day started at 6am) which is crazy considering this was a 2 hour direct flight; we waited and waited, about 45 minutes after watching 2 different planes shoot out half of their passengers luggage we were told Orlando was short staffed and that Chicago's plane would be about 2-3 hours before we got our luggage, talk about a what wait moment. Finally at 8pm roughly we were all told to go to a different carousel were luggage starts coming from Chicago and what would you know, our bag is gone, nowhere to be found. I panicked, we were told to try to check number 7, 8, 6, and 10's carousel, again, another wait what moment. So at this point, after a 12 hour day of travel (we had a 2 hour direct flight) we have no luggage and the representatives and workers you look to for direction are less than helpful. We are told to fill out a claim and given 1-800 numbers for references with a claim number. I was told it could possibly be on two planes tomorrow (Saturday) and then given a direct line to the frontier luggage office and was promised someone would answer and if they are busy to leave a voicemail because someone is always there. After 3 voicemails to the direct office and 3 calls to the 1-800 number I attempted the direct office for a 4th time and someone answered, 24 hours in to our bag being missing they STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS which is just wild to me. We were there for a work conference for myself and had two nice days to indulge which were spent finding Lyft's to the nearest Walgreens and walmarts to put ourselves back together which really was just a bummer and time sucker and not close to cheap. Our days consisted of walking up and calling for updates to get false promises and finding an outfit to be ready in time for thr work events, we didn't even swim. The airline refund our checked bag fee each way which I had to ask for. We also were able to bring one carry on each to get our newly bought clothes home. We were given $100 dollars a day which is a joke for two people to buy clothes, toiletries, make up, bags to put our items in to travel home from Orlando, and not to mention the Lyft's.  P.S. we are going on day 5 and still have no location of our bag."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Miami to Newark,February 2020,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,5,no,3,"  Miami to Newark. My family and I have exclusively flown Frontier for years and I have very seldom had a negative thing to say. However, today’s flight experience has unfortunately changed my perspective. The plane arrived slightly earlier than expected and we boarded in a timely manner. I always suggest priority boarding because the perks of getting to your seat before the crowd is worth the few extra dollars. The aircraft was clean and overall I was satisfied when boarding. However, the enjoyment of my trip was immediately disrupted by the actions taken by one crew member. While having a discussion with a fellow passenger, I was approached by the flight attendant. He informed me that the demonstration for emergency information was going on and I needed to pay attention. I was unaware that my conversation was disrupting the other passengers from the presentation so I quickly apologized and waited for instruction to be done before resuming. Things ran smoothly after that, descent was near perfect and I was content with my experience. It wasn’t until the beverage cart came around that I can say I had an issue. Although airplane beer, wine and spirits are somewhat overpriced, I tend to pay the extra money to relieve some stress from travel. When ordering my drink, the flight attendant proceeded to tell me that I could not be served and that boarding an aircraft “while intoxicated” was illegal. He seemed to have made that unwarranted decision based on the incident prior, having nothing to do with my actual blood/alcohol level. As an adult, a Frontier frequent flyer, and a paying customer, this incident should have never taken place. To assume someone is incoherent without any knowledge of the situation is absurd. After I had willingly apologized for not realizing his demonstration was taking place, I felt as though he was basically reprimanding me and to assume someone is intoxicated over them making an honest mistake is by far an overreaction and completely unprofessional. My colleagues, my family and myself will no longer be flying Frontier. We will choose a different airline that treats their patrons with respect. I’m embarrassed to know such a profitable company would hire someone who would take personal offense to a passenger not giving them their undivided attention. I fly multiple times in a month and have never experienced such a thing. I will be recommending Delta from here on out."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Atlanta,February 2020,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  New York to Atlanta. Worst flight experience ever! IMy flight got delayed 3 times which it didn't shown on their website, I had checked multiple times before having my only available ride drive me a hour and half to the city. First it was delayed from weather which they didn't announce in person either till a lot of people started asking questions and then technical difficulties,then when we finally boarded and I guess they were still having technical difficulties mind you it's like 9 pm, the flight was supposed to have left originally at 6pm they had everyone get off the plane and then canceled the flight which I definitely understand, but the reason I'm writing this is because they did not care at all if people were stuck in a unfamiliar area, I was traveling alone and my opinions were to get on the next flight with them at 6pm the next day or buy a new ticket with a different airline that they said they would reimburse in a week which I couldn't afford because all last minute flights were $300+ I barely had the money to get there in the first place for a family funeral and they wouldn't provide anyone with a New York Id with a Free hotel I just moved to Georgia so my ID is still NY So I had to go with the flight at 6pm the next day, I spent a night and half a day at the airport with a crazy creepy men harassing me while I waited at different terminal because the one I was in was not open 24/7 and there was no barley any security at this point, I feel they shouldn't have excluded people with a New York Id from getting a hotel I was so upset I was crying in public something I never do I felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable with the whole situation"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Guadalajara,December 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Houston to Guadalajara. Frontier pretty much allows Volarís to not only oversell extra tickets to the public but also to frontier airlines as a contract with them and we were unable to fly to Mexico on Christmas day. The next flight out was eight hours later, so we spent Christmas day at the airport without a good answer as to why they can do that legally.  The supervisor said that for the delay volarís would give us a reward for the problem of $1,345 dollars for the delay and overselling of tickets and nothing happened! A volarís worker called us a few days later asking our bank details but they never made the deposit and now they don't answer our questions or calls ignoring the problem by playing the blame game with Frontier. . Frontier airlines continues to hang up the call claiming to transfer us to someone that can help because they do not want to deal with the problem (have called five times and they do the same thing). Volarís does not have a phone line to call, they have email service in which they do not respond because they believe that this is frontier fault when it was their airline involved as well!  It is better to pay a little more for an good American airline on which one can depend on instead of these airlines. I will not fly with them again."

We had a 2-hour layover in Denver 5 minutes before our flight was scheduled to board the told us the flight was canceled due to no pilot go to the service desk to reschedule. There they had no fights. Absolutely no help we got lucky and got seats on an America Airlines flight to Fort Lauderdale and had to arrange transportation to the Ship the last minute tickets on America cost us 269.08 a peace extra. Frontier will only refund our original cost and give us a 100.00 travel voucher for future travel. Like we will ever fly Frontier again they also have to be used by 4/20/2020. What a joke they also lost our luggage at the airport and we had to get it 3 hours later
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Philadelphia,February 2020,2.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  New Orleans to Philadelphia. Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I have travelled on in 35 plus years of business and personal travel and scores and scores of flights. The plane was delayed over 3 hours (8:20 PM flight from New Orleans to Philadelphia) for mechanical reasons. Frontier customer service told me there was nothing they could offer me to offset the cost of now having to pay for a lift or Uber to take me home (since my family would not be able to meet me at 3:30AM). I'm told they did offer food vouchers at the gate, but I was already sitting at the airport restaurant when I found out. It costs $45 for a carry on bag, which I knew, but seriously? The plane was very clean, but the seats really look like molded plastic with a cloth cover. And they pretty much feel that way. The tray table is smaller than an 8-1/2 x 11 piece of paper. No, it doesn't start small then fold out. It just is small. Flight was fine, but I really felt like I was flying in a tin can (and I have no fear of flying) so I just kept my eyes closed the whole time. When we arrived at the gate (a little ahead of time, thank you pilot), my carryon bag wasn't where I'd put it in the overhead. First I looked around and said ""Oh my God, where is my bag?"". Since I was sitting very close to the back I was maybe 6 people in front of the rear flight attendants, but no one responded, so I ran off and ran down the hallway shouting, ""Will everyone please check their backpacks? Someone accidentally took mine"". People were great, they checked and said ""Nope, it's mine"" as I ran past them. Defeated, exhausted, on the verge of tears I went back to the gate to check the overheads again. I couldn't get back on the plane, but one of service workers went on and checked for me. About 5 minutes later he came back with it and told me that it had been moved to the back of the plane to make more room! What? It's not unusual for a flight attendant to move a bag, but they always point to it or hold it up and make a general announcement, asking ""whose bag is this?"" and letting the person know the bag is being moved and where. So unprofessional and thoughtless. Overall, I'd say it's the worst airline with the laziest support staff I've ever dealt with (excluding the guy who actually opened his mouth, moved his legs and used his brain to try to help me). Full disclosure, I did get an email while I was in flight apologizing for the delay and offering me a $50 credit toward a future Frontier flight.  Their tagline is Low Fares Done Right. I think they should change it to these lines from an Alice Walker poem: Expect nothing. Live frugally on surprise. Bottom line: Avoid it if you can."

We had to change from Las Vegas to Fort Myers due to weather and storms. I called next day and changed. I was charged 139 per ticket. I was told the next day by their customer service that I volunteered to pay. What baloney! I reached someone today and said even though I made change next day I was 4 hours Short of the 24 hour window to change a flight for free. I asked for supervisor but not able to reach one.

Worst airline ever - here I sit once again in the airport, Las Vegas this time, waiting for a delayed Frontier flight. I’m ashamed to admit I have flown this airline too many times. This time because I had a $75 voucher from a previously cancelled Frontier flight from November, that left me stranded overnight, sleeping on airport floors while trying to get home to a dying family member. I couldn’t hold back the tears for my beloved family member whose time had come and had to publicly grieve my way through the experience in the airport thanks to Frontier and their cancellations and delays, plane mechanical problems, and whatever excuses they use. Staff are never helpful - they have to deal with these issues continuously and probably hate their jobs. I can’t blame them working for such a chaotic uncaring company. As I sit here and hear all the good airlines (United, Delta, American) calling “last boarding call” and couriering away their happy customers on time, I’m once again jealous and disappointed as I wait and wait. And wait..... almost an hour delay now. No new announcements about the delay. The suspense is building. Will we actually get on a plane to our destination tonight or will it be tomorrow? Maybe Frontier cancels the flight again and I get to sleep on the airport floor tonight. "

The change was the return flight from Orlando would involve a layover in Las Vegas so we would leave Orlando at 7:30pm and arrive in Denver at 4:40am! I have 2 small children and was told this was now my only option. Totally unacceptable! They did cancel the flights for a full refund but I will never look at a flight with Frontier again.

They had me staying in the same clothing and draws the entire weekend until i returned home this morning 2/3/2020. Miami station contact number never answers the phone when i call nor called me to give me an update. Nobody care out there and look at this as a simple job so they're not invested to attend nicely to customers.  I spent my days calling them every hour to have an update and they keep on telling me different stories that don't match, i have not being able to sleep at night and anxieties are getting the best of me since then.  I always fly South west, or United and Delta but this was my first time to use Frontier. Frontier please find my bag, I need it."

We waited 1 hour and 45 minutes to see a ticket agent .. there were only a couple even working the desk, and were told we were not allowed to board the flight because there was only 5 minutes left to take off. They refused to refund our money, refused to put us on a different airline, refused to rebook us on the next morning's flight unless we paid an additional $250 per ticket, for each of us, after we had already paid $285 for the flight they wouldn't let us board. On top of that, we lost approx $200 on concert tickets that we were flying to Vegas to see and we were charged for the hotel that we didn't show up for. My aunt spent 2 hours on the phone trying to get this taken care of and it was a hideous level of customer service. Will never fly Frontier again. This is clearly a pattern and practice, since there are other reviews of this same thing happening in airports all over the country."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Orlando,January 2020,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Kansas City to Orlando. My family's flight to Orlando was most unpleasant. I would not recommend flying Frontier (first time ever flying with them). The seats are uncomfortable, and baggage check is so pricey, the discounted ticket isn’t even worth not just paying more upfront and flying Southwest. You don’t even get standard complimentary beverages or snacks during the flight either, and have to order them if you want anything, no matter the length of the flight for extremely outrageous prices. We had already tacked on an extra $200 in baggage fees alone, this for bags that were carry-on sizes and were just not allowed to be considered ""personal items"" because they had wheels. We started out late by boarding the flight beginning 30 minutes later than scheduled, then spent another hour on the fully boarded plane sitting on the runway in Kansas City waiting to depart (for unexplained reasons). We ended up being over 2 1/2 hours later in total than what was scheduled by the time we had sat for another hour on a parked plane waiting on the runway for a terminal to become available to exit the plane in Orlando. This due to another plane having taken our plane's terminal for unloading because of our late arrival, and we could not exit until that plane and all its baggage was completely cleared and moved. We had set aside all of Sunday for traveling so that we wouldn't risk missing our first day at Disney... however, this did mean that on a Sunday night, all restaurants and delivery services were closed by the time we got our baggage claimed (which we finally did after roaming around aimlessly. Our bags had been moved to a different baggage claim terminal from what was stated when we were getting off the plane, and failed to be announced at the airport), found ground transportation, got an Uber and made it to our hotel. So we were unable to get anything to eat outside of vending machine stuff since we were without a vehicle, due to our plans to use Disney transportation throughout our stay at the park. We should have arrived in Orlando around 10:30 p.m., but did not end up getting to our hotel until after 3am. The whole thing was a terrible experience that I will never put my family or myself through ever again. The return flight back to Kansas City was with Spirit Airlines, also a first time flying with them. Their baggage fees were similar and a real slap in the face, however the flight staff was at least polite and attentive, and the seats were a lot more comfortable. We will likely fly Spirit again, but will only book it for a quick to-and-from trip so that we would only need a personal item to board with (this is the onl way anyone could possibly benefit from the money savings of booking with either of these 2 airlines).

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,January 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Atlanta to Denver. Not worth the perceived savings. I ended up paying way more in the end than if I would have booked with a reputable airline from the beginning. Keep in mind that Frontier is almost guaranteed to be the furthest concourse and furthest gate from the entrance so if you do risk it, give yourself way more time than with a normal airline. Also, the price is misleading as the ticket price doesn’t include a carry-on. So tag on $45 to the ticket price. Be very aware of your booking time as well. They will use the time 12:59 AM which looks like the night of the day you want to travel but it’s actually the night before the day you want to travel. Then they will not honor the honest mistake and charge a change fee of $190. Stick with the standard airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Austin,January 2020,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  San Francisco to Austin. Never fly Frontier out of San Francisco. I arrived for my flight today (Friday, January 17th) two hours early, and had issues starting with check-in. The self-check-in kiosk was old and out of date, so my credit card got stuck in the card reader, and when I finally dislodged it, the kiosk told me to ""see agent."" After waiting in line to check in at the terribly under-staffed counters, I went to security, only to find an excessively long TSA line. Since Frontier flies out the international terminal in SFO, you have to go through international security — in my case, this meant that I got in line at 8:20 am (an hour and 20 minutes before my flight), and was still standing in line at 9:25, when boarding closed. After finally making it through security, I ran to my gate, only to find that the flight had departed (in fact, it departed slightly early). The airport staff at the gate offered to put me on the next available flight to Austin — which happened to be on Sunday, two days from now.  When I asked  for a refund or voucher for a future flight, I was given a phone number. When I called the phone number, I spoke to a very friendly but utterly clueless employee  who told me that it was beyond her power to give me a refund, and that I should talk instead to airport staff — which of course, I had already done. After going back and forth on this a few times, several things became evident that I would not get any sort of refund or compensation for the flight, despite the fact that the TSA delay was completely beyond my control, that the Frontier staff are desperately unhelpful that I should never fly Frontier out of San Francisco again."

I was flying from Miami to Cincinnati. I am disabled. The Frontier employees I encountered are rude bossy and unhelpful.  I flew down from cvg to Fort Lauderdale but the flights returning home had to be out of Miami. Cruises usually get in at 7 am. You get off most ships by 9am. I was transferred to Miami about 5 hours prior to flight home. I got in line at Frontier I tried to check my luggage. The rude ticket agent said you can’t check it now. We have nowhere to hold your luggage. I said I am  disabled can’t they take it a little early. The ticket agent ordered me to go sit down. There were no empty seats. I said where should I sit. She just pointed but there was no seat. I went to go find a seat. I tapped the shoulder of a frontier employee who was walking bye me. She turned around then put her hand up no no and kept walking. She did not even know what I wanted. I never found a seat. I sat in a wheelchair for a while but was dragged out of the wheelchair by employees so I ended up sitting on the floor.  I had to wait till 2 hours before the flight. I ended up with pnuemonia cause I had to sit on the floor. I never found an empty seat at Miami Airport. Frontier staff are rude unhelpful they hate their jobs.

We have had a good trip with Frontier on our way up and they have good cabin crew. Unfortunately, the way back was just an awful mess of customer service. The Raleigh-Durham staff were kind and the cabin crew were also kind. The bad part was when after we landed into Tampa. The captain jumped onto the PA and said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tampa, unfortunately, the ramp is closed"". The crew should've gave out beverages. We landed at 3:17pm and didn't get off until 3:30pm. We got down to the baggage and the Frontier flight from Ohio and ours were on the same belt. Then ours disappears. Soon, the Ohio flight goes off and the flight and the ramp finally reopens. Soon, the Ramp recloses. The Frontier staffer down there was on her phone."

The flight was decent for the price I paid for the plane ticket. After landing, I went to retrieve my luggage from baggage claim and to my dismay my clothing had been tossed carelessly into the bottom on a large bag along with my suitcase. I was able to speak with an attendant who informed me that by bag ended up like this because ""I"" overpacked it. I explained to her this was not the case at all since my trip would be short not to mention I had plenty of room in my bag even after packing was complete. She offers me a cheap suitcase which was not comparable to the original case claiming that was the only available case she had to switch out the original suitcase with. I refused this option and decided to weight the options of contacting customer service or just purchasing me another suitcase while in Vegas. While attempting to repack my original suitcase the attendant returned with a different suitcase that was more comparable to the original. I decided that I would take that suitcase in order to make it to my hotel. I kept my original suitcase with hopes of returning home with it for repair due to the value of the suitcase which was apart of a set. After the trip I returned to the airport to return home where I requested that my original bag be flown home at no cost due to the inconvenience. I was introduced to a manager in which she attempted to make no accommodation besides explaining to me to cost of adding another bag. After getting absolutely no where I had to pay $55 to ship back my suitcase that was handled poorly by the Frontier staff to begin with. I do not understand why I would suffer monetary discomfort due to the inconvenience created by Frontier especially considering that I had to pay to check a bag in the first place. I am extremely unhappy with this airline and they have made a first impression to last a lifetime."

I pre paid for these specific seats to ensure he was in my row with my younger daughter. Ground staff at gate whom was very nice told me to ask about switching it and that it happens. The gentleman whom was in the seat very polite with me pointed this out to the Frontier airlines that somehow this happened. He was asking for a refund for his seat. Myself I said I'd like to stay out of it I'm happy to have my son sit in the different row. Well it ended with me having to move me and my two children to the back of the plane. Paid for the other seats for a reason. It was a very hectic time in the airport and I just wanted to be left alone. It unfortunately did not end there. One of the staff was looking at my phone as I was writing an email to frontier to ask for a reimbursement on my seats. They took it upon themselves to not come and talk to me as a human being. They sat back there talking poorly about me because I wrote frontier. I was appalled. One of the other employees had stated well because this gentleman paid for his seats i said well so did I. They failed to recall this gentleman was the one whom asked for a refund which I found was reasonable but took it upon themselves to find I was the problem. I told them I was fine just splitting my son up so there was not any confrontation. I was very saddened by their treatment towards me. I found it to be very unprofessional to talk poorly about me and my family because an error on the website booking. Very saddened by all of it. My flight to Tampa was excellent. It was the cabin staff and the error on the website that really has deterred myself from ever flying frontier again.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Bozeman via Tucson,December 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier is quite simply the worst airline when it comes to owning up to their mistakes and issuing any refunds. I had a flight booked out of Phoenix. They cancelled it due to maintenance problems at the last minute but I didn't know that until I got to the airport and stood in line. I had to take a shuttle up from Tucson to catch the Phoenix flight so had already spent money getting there. I stood in line trying to see how I could get from Phoenix to Bozeman on other flights, but they won't issue you a credit unless it's the next available flight. That flight required a 10 hour layover. We talked about my taking a flight two days out. I put my credit card on the table on that without being told all of the details. I hadn't realized she processed it immediately. Then I asked her when it left and found out that it departed at 5:50 in the morning. I said that I could never get a shuttle from Tucson at that time and to give me back my card and 'undo' the ticket. She understood. I got home and saw in my email that the new reservation went through. I called them immediately the day it had been made and was told that they would not refund my money even though I was at the counter when I asked for the reservation to be reversed. To be frank, I wasn't even sure that a new reservation had been made because we were still talking about whether that new flight would meet my needs when the reservationist must have put it through. I left the airport and got another shuttle back down to Tucson. I called Frontier 4 times. Their customer service goes through a foreign country where accents are hard to understand. I wrote them twice. Working with them is like hitting your head against a brick wall. They then told me to drive all the way from Tucson to Phoenix to speak to someone (who they couldn't say) and for whom they had no phone number. Why would anyone do that? Frontier will drive you insane when there is a problem. They don't want to give any refunds under any circumstances. They are a horrible company for customer service."

I cancelled a flight in order to purchase a flight that would get me into Vegas at a specific time so I could meet a client. I paid $10 more for the new flight. The new flight with Frontier was delayed 3 hours. I missed my client and money in my pocket. Frustrated I explained this to the check in desk and asked if there was anything I could do. The agent literally ignored me, didn’t so much as look at me, and printed a boarding pass and told me to have a nice day. I explained I was already checked in and explained the situation again. She was so rude and disrespectful and asked if I wanted a full refund and I thought sure that would be nice. As she was going about doing that I could tell by her attitude and body language something wasn’t right. I asked so does that mean I won’t be on this flight? She said yes and continued to cancel my booking without telling me she was going to! I said no I still need to get on the flight I’m just asking if there is anything you can do to get me there sooner. She was sarcastic and rude and so disrespectful in her manners and responses. I was disgusted because I was simply asking very standard questions. I left and went to my gate. Waited three hours, spent $50 on a chicken sandwich and glass of wine. As we began boarding I noticed the same agent was the boarding agent. There was a commotion at the front of the line and I saw that there was a family asking her questions and she was repeating the same thing to them over and over again without looking at any of them. I knew that she was at least 10 years my junior and probably 20 years younger than the father she was treating so rudely. The family looked frustrated and insulted and finally gave up. As I boarded the plane and I kid you not she took my ticket and started yelling sarcastically over and over again for me to have a nice day. I couldn’t get a word in edgewise. All of her co-workers stopped to stare. It was humiliating. I landed in Vegas at midnight and after all that couldn’t bring myself to wait for an Uber so I sprung for a cab costing another $23. All in all I spent almost $100 for a $56 flight that cost me my time, a client, humiliation, and money in my pocket and for what? No reason at all. I understand flights get delayed but in my experience any other airline would at least offer an apology or try to help in some way shape or form. Not this one. Never again. I will never ever fly Frontier again."

Minneapolis to Denver . Never in my life have I been more upset an an airline. I originally purchased my tickets on a whim to see my partner for a short excursion. The tickets were just over $100 so it felt like a steal. Instead, when I arrived at the the airport I discovered, much to my surprise, that the dates had been changed two some random time later in the month. To clarify: I had selected a specific dates, visually checked to make sure the dates and other info was correct then pushed the button to confirm. I did everything in my power to make sure I selected the right flight. But I guess that isn't enough for Frontier, oh no. And as much as I wanted to just walk right out the door, these were the only dates available so I had no choice but to pay nearly $400 for what was originally a $120, all while the lady behind the counter told me I needed to ""smile more"" because I was lucky enough to get a seat. Never will I ever fly Frontier again and if you're smart neither will you. Take Spirit Airlines, at least they don't ask you to be happy while they nickle and dime you."

They caused my daughter and I to miss our flight meaning missed work and school charged me for it after telling me there would be no cost and then refused to rectify their error. Three months later have been calling them non stop to locate my luggage or obtain some time of refund for the items in my luggage - the representatives aren’t properly trained or informed no one can give you the correct information and their customer service is horrible. I have been hung up on multiple times and I have been nothing but calm and reasonable with these people. And no one can actually help me or give me a straight answer. If you need to travel on a budget I recommend selecting another airline they are horrific.

You can’t put the seats back, but I’m actually glad since I rather the people in front of me not do it because my legs are a 36 inseam. I don’t care about perks if it means saving money. What you need to watch is the Mastercard offer that shows constantly while you are on the site and while you’re making reservations. It says it will give you 40,000 miles if you spend $500.00 with the annual fee. I needed to read the fine print because it does not include the reservation you’re making at the present time, but the next time you book. I didn’t get that until too late and I was approved. When I called to ask why they did not give me the 40,000 miles they told me the rule and immediately canceled my card and now we agreed, also in the fine print, to keep and use our information for 7 years even after we cancelled the card! The company was Barclays Bank of Delaware.  They state on the offer: ""after spending $500 on purchases in the first 90 days & paying the annual fee.” ""Redeem for up to 2 round trip award tickets.” They do not approve you right away so I called and told them to put the payment on the card and I would cancel the amount on the card I used since Frontier would not approve us right away which is weird since our credit is perfect. That is when I found out I could not use that transaction for my 40,000 miles."

We stood in a line until 1 am to be booked to hotels to stay over night. About 15 of us were told that we were booked to the hotel ""Pullman Miami Airport"" and we had to get to the hotel by ourselves. When we arrived, the hotel told us that there were no room available and we were not booked at all. Ridiculous.  To get rid of us, they tricked us to the hotel by setting us up! We tried to contact this airline and couldn't make the phone call through anymore. When we realized Frontier set us up, it was about 3 am. Some of us slept in the lobby and some of us booked other hotels by ourselves. I slept for less than 2 hours that night."

This is what a couple attendants said. Once we were off, they announced it was for mechanical issue. Already trapped in their lie. The run around from the airline after is what is most frustrating. The letter given to everyone, stated there would be a reimbursement up to $400 with another airline. This letter states it would be 14 days. The request was filed out on 11/27, as of today, 12/30 I do not have my reimbursement. Since then, I have had several emails to their customer service, all with more of this airlines ""standard run around procedure"". Do not fly on this airline if you do not have to."

I recently booked a refundable (paid extra) r/t to Denver from DCA (Washington) and had to make a slight change. The change saved me $47 but unbeknownst to me at the time what I should have done is cancel the flight altogether and start over. Essentially what the airline has done is trick me into going with the quicker fix which was to change the existing flight times rather than rebook entirely. My assumption was that the difference I saved (approximately $50) would go back to my credit card when in fact I was given a credit towards the next flight which has to be used within a year. I tried to appeal to them on the phone but they said the only way I could get that money back was to cancel the flight altogether which I am no longer in a position to do. In essence the airline has stolen a depreciating asset (cash) from me (via deception) that I must use on another flight or lose it altogether. I don't know about you but I call that theft and deception, and I am disgusted."

Frontier notified me that they had hanged my flight which will happen I understand - don't like it but understand. They sent an email to notify me with a link that basically said click here to see changes. The odd thing was I don't automatically download email images for security reasons and the label behind the view changes button actually said ACCEPT CHANGES. This concerned me but I clicked anyway. The link wouldn't work. I received repeated emails asking me to acknowledge the change. Same story. Consequently, I went to their app and logged in. It wouldn't work. Because they moved my flight I lost my seat assignment and I was traveling with my son. I had seats same row across the aisle originally that they let me assign. In my own lapse, I neglected that I would lose my seat assignment (I had actually paid for an upgraded seat) and didn't realize I needed to re-assign seats until check in. Their email reminded me to check in. A good point for Frontier that the reminder actually was sent. From the link on the email I was unable to make seat changes while checking in. SO again I went to the app where it was unclear where to make seat changes and upon clicking check in it said AN UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED So I did it again but it has already assigned a seat. I go back in to make the changes again and cannot and on each attempt I get the UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED. SO I call Frontier. Imagine the fun. Upon listening to their poorly scripted phone tree message I'm told that I may have to pay $25 for an agents assistance and that I could do it for free on their web site. Ahh the irony. So the agent in southern India finally picks up and reads the scripted lines. I explain my issues and ask my questions. She never really answered my questions and inelegantly attempted to turn her answers in to positive responses that had nothing to do with my question. She explained because my son was a minor our reservations had to be linked. This was never indicated before. So she linked them. Then she could change them. Online there were plenty of adjoining seats open (unless again its their system that's at fault) My son is currently in the back of the plane and I'm in the front; somehow I think we'll both have middle seats. I was told to change it at the gate (when the likelihood of change is low since seats will have been filled). They just don't have the infrastructure to run a modern airline. If you have low expectations and very few options, fly Frontier."

We landed at 8:50 and got off the gate at 9:50 because the pilot said a catering truck blocked the path. This cheap airline doesn’t even have food on-board to even have a catering truck. The luggage takes 2 hours to reach the carousel. It’s as good as flying a North Korean carrier like Air Koryo where they at least have a sense of responsibility to the customers on board. This entire airline and company is a sham and should really be avoided at all costs. Multiple hidden fees make it more expensive than regular carriers.

From start to finish this airline was unprofessional and most importantly unreliable.

There was no call over intercom to announce that the plane is boarding and departing. Myself and the other 8 people that also missed their flight went down to the front desk and were told that we have to pay an additional $120 and the next flight was not for another 6 hours and we had to fly through another state. The Manager (located at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport) for Frontier was very rude when we asked when the flight left and why we did not receive any notice told us to immediately leave and the cops would come get us. I also spoke to customer service over the phone and they could not do anything about the situation either unless we paid $120 per person. Apparently Frontier is not obligated to call out for flights over the intercom I was told. So to anyone flying with them next beware because all they want to do is take your money, make it more possible for you to miss your flight and then take some more money. I would rather walk next time to my destination than fly with this incoherent, rude and selfish airline. Thank you for ruining my holidays Frontier, I greatly appreciate your divine service."

My husband and I have attempted to call the booking line to 5 times (no exaggeration) to request assistance with booking the flight. Each time, we speak with a friendly representative who apologizes for the issue and states that he/she can’t correct the problem, and we will have to speak with someone in the “Discount Den Department.” At this time, we are placed on hold and either immediately disconnected before reaching the Discount Den representative, or we reach the Discount Den representative and are disconnected within seconds of connecting with the representative. We have sent a feedback message through the website to request assistance with this matter and received an auto-response email stating that we will hear back from someone within 10 days or our email.

They rebooked us for today but we are now stuck in Denver for a 5 hour layover, which was just delayed an additional 50 min. We’ve lost out on our rental car, so we have to rebook that and only hope that they will reimburse us. And we lost one night at the hotel that we will not get reimbursed for. Not sure how Disney will work out but I am highly doubtful we will be able to do that now with all these added costs and less time spent in Orlando. We are devastated! During all this, the customer service rep was no help and had no empathy about this situation and refused to get a supervisor for us to talk to. Poor customer service."

When we arrived at Denver airport, I went to speak to Frontier airlines agent and they told me there is no other flight leaving for El Paso on November 13, 2019, so I can schedule you for the next day November 14th, 2019 at 3:15pm there is flight leaving from Denver to El paso. I told the agent I have an appointment at Las Cruces and I can't wait till tomorrow. So either give me a partial refund or find me a return flight on the same day. The agent at the airport told me that she can give me partial refund and it will be in my bank account within 10 business days. Till now I haven't received a single penny from Frontier Airlines. I called them today and the customer service is telling me that you arrived at Denver just in time to catch the connecting flight to El paso which was leaving at 3:45pm on November 13th, 2019. Moral of the story I missed my connecting flight all due to the airline fault and lost my money and had to go with United Airlines to reach El paso on November 13th, 2019. Clearly they are really good at bluffing, and they have lots of technical problems and you can miss your flights.

In addition, the Frontier website did not work when we tried to pre-print our boarding passes. As a result Pre-Check was not provided and we had the hassle of going thru the regular security lines.

However, I was at the gate at 13:00. The doors were already closed, and there was no one at the desk. Another traveler was there as well. We both tried calling Frontier. I was on hold for half an hour. He spoke with someone who said they were sending someone to open the door. I spoke with a Frontier agent at another desk, who called someone, and said someone was coming to open the door. No one came. The plane sat without moving for an hour, but we were not allowed on. There were at least 4 of us who ""missed"" the flight, one of whom was sitting at the gate the entire time. We were all booked on the later flight that night. When I got there for the later flight, another flight had been delayed at our gate, then left early. There were 9 people left that time. One of the passengers had been speaking with the boarding attendant. The boarding attendant knew where that family was going and, when they didn't hear his loudspeaker announcement, just left them sitting there! Who does that? They were, literally, directly in front of him. I know you're supposed to pay attention, but the flight boards had been wrong all day, and it's very hard to hear the loudspeaker. They were also traveling with 4 children. I understand the closed door policy, due to safety. What I don't understand is not notifying people of an early departure. If you can notify of a delayed flight by text, there's no reason you can't send all important notifications that way. I also don't understand the complete lack of humanity the boarding agent showed that family by not even telling them that it was their flight he was calling for. Appalling."

My return flight was the same day with Frontier. It had already been a long day so I decided to upgrade to better legroom for the return flight (exit row). Upon boarding the aircraft and sitting down, I was informed that my daughter who is 6 years old was too young to sit in the exit row. I was not made aware of this until we were on the plane and I had already upgraded. The steward said I would have to swap with someone so I swapped with the couple in front of me and I was told to contact customer service in order to have the fee I paid for the upgrade refunded since I didn’t get to sit in the seat. Several attempts were made to call customer service over the holidays. Each met with an hour wait so I didn’t bother. Fast forward to today, the 30th where I finally make it through after sitting on hold for an hour. The first representative was from India, could barely speak English and after giving me the round about for 30 minutes, proceeds to transfer my call to god knows where and hangs up on me. At this point I’m livid but I call again. The second representative, of course, from India and can barely speak English. After going back and forth again I’m directed to put in a request via the website. They can’t solve it over the phone due to there not being any “official documentation that I didn’t get to sit in my seat”. Long story short, I’m probably screwed out of the money I paid to upgrade my seat due to their complete and utter incompetence/lack of effective resolutions. They’re unorganised, terrible customer service, incredibly uncomfortable flights and by far the worst airline to deal with. Do not fly with them. The money you save is not worth the hassles you may deal with. God help you if you travel with them and you run into any delays/issues. They will not help you resolve them because they already have your money. 0/10 across the board."

I had a purse and a small shopping bag I purchased in Phoenix flying back to Vegas which I know is just a personal item. When I attempted to board the flight they would not allow me on without paying for a carry on $60! I told them this item would be with me in my hand and not take up space on there flight and they said you can only take 1 item. I said ok and placed my small bag inside my purse no big deal. They still wouldn't allow me on the flight! I had to call my husband for a credit card number I will never fly this greedy airline again! And the lady at the desk  was very nasty and unwilling to help!

First off they told me that even though I had already paid for my checked bag that I would not only have to pay for it again that as I had a 5 hour layover that they would not be able to check me in for several hours. After talking to several employees and a supervisor they were not only unable to help me they were unwilling to help me. And insisted I would have to pay over 100 dollars for my one checked bag as well as not being able to check in or several hours. I have flown frontier many times as I travel for business I after this experience I will be using other airlines from now on as this was by far the worst customer experience I have ever endured I would highly recommend paying a little more and flying any other airline in the end you will be much happier in the end.

Customer service ignored passengers standing in line at the desk, pretended not to see everyone and talked amongst themselves. Outrageous cost for luggage also. Wasted 1 day of vacation on a beautiful sunny day because of this airline. The least they could have done was to keep passengers updated. They gave out $10.00 vouchers but very limited on where they could be used plus they expired the next day - just a big joke, keep them Frontier. I should have believed all of the reviews I had read about this airline and saved myself and family some stress. Never again."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philidelphia to Orlando,March 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I flew to and from Philidelphia for a wedding with Frontier. The flight there was ok, but the flight back was the worst flight I've ever had. During the flight, I noticed a female flight attendant in the front preventing people from using the restroom. She was getting items from the bathroom, and when someone would go to use it she yelled at them and stated to go to the back. Well, halfway through the flight I needed to relieve myself. I tried going up to the front to use the bathroom, and as I got up and walked past a flight attendant, she accosted me and stated the seat belt sign was on so I needed to go sit down. I stated I was going to the bathroom and kept walking. The flight attendant at the front yelled at me to go use the bathroom at the back and stated I could not use the one in the front. As I went to the back 2 attendants were serving drinks. I went up to them and they proceeded to ignore me. Then the female attendant turned to her male coworker and spoke to him loudly with attitude, ""I don't know what this guy is trying to do!"" So I told them I needed to use the restroom. She then yelled at me, ""Well we are serving people! You'll have to come back later!"" So I stormed off and forcefully sat back in my seat. After we landed the flight crew then informed us they were really tired so we would be doing them a favor picking up after ourselves so they didn't have to. Never again will I fly Frontier and neither should you. Paying extra is worth it for different airlines, at least they let you use the bathroom on-board. Also Frontier hits you with hidden fees so it's actually not cheaper compared to other airlines."

I will most likely never repeat with Frontier."

First the flight was delayed, then a gate change, then the gate changes yet again. Compile this with short tempered employees that provided a horrible customer service experience. First and last time on this airline for me. I don't care what the extra expense is. Frontier just isn't worth whatever small savings you get."

I made that statement based on a previous experience with this airline. This time its even worse. The flight that was going to Florida from California was delayed, and there was no notification so as to make proper arrangements. The staff at the check-in were not helpful either. In fact, they acted as if the delay was my fault. After an hour delay I was told, there was an additional one hour delay, so by the time getting to Florida, the flight to Atlanta had already departed, The staff said there would be no other available flight until 4 days later. I was forced to book another flight with another airline, which costs me way more because of the urgency. The staff said there was nothing they could do about the delay other than to refund. It was the most horrible experience I have ever had with any airlines. Comparing the pain I endured to the cheapness of the ticket, the value of the money is 1/10. I will never recommend nor fly Frontier airlines again."

Horrible, inconsistent, condescending gate staff that act like robots. My bag fit under the seat on the flight out, but was 2"" too big for their measuring device. No exceptions no matter your loyalty. If you're disgruntled, the captain will also join in the 'however I can throw my weight around and not accommodate our customers' party they seem to thrive on. Never again will I endure this joke of a so-called airline. Southwest here I come!"

Our flight was delayed several times with little explanation then canceled altogether at the last minute.They had our entire plane waiting 8 hours to find out they canceled the flight. They also informed us that we would have a new departure time for today (11/12/19) at 12pm. Now they have delayed departure once more. We aren’t sure. The sheer lack of transparency and information by the Frontier staff is absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional. They will claim they did all they could do, however, this is not true. Out of respect for their paying customers, they should have made decisions much earlier in the day allowing their passengers to find local hotel accommodations versus sleeping nearly the entire flight on the Mexican airport floors. This is truly the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Not because the flight was determined canceled but for the lack of respect for their paying customers."

Frontier customer service is poorly if at all trained to handle the many issues that may arise with customer inquiries regarding their policies and procedures. The different fractions of this organization are not organized nor well versed in the necessity to effectively communicate to the appropriate department with a goal of a successful resolution for its staff but more importantly to its clientele. They need to acknowledge the fact that when an unfortunate event occurs, it is not always the client who is at fault and should suffer the penalty. A customer representative hung up in my face when she became unable to answer questions regarding its policies, procedures, and overall movement at their ticket counter."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Phoenix to Tampa via Denver,November 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst flight experience ever. I only booked my ticket with Frontier because I wanted to leave Phoenix in the last flight for the day. However, It is hard to believe that there could be a worse flight service than Spirit Airlines. For sure there is - The award of worse flight experience ever goes to Frontier. Seats  are very uncomfortable, it is not possible to recline the seats. I felt like I was seating in a piece of wood. I am 6'1 foot tall and my legs cannot fit in the space between my seat and the seat in front of me. Once I sat down, I could not move for hours. Also the seat is too short, so I could not rest my head for the whole flight. My neck is still hurting from the flight.  Staff  were rude and any questions we may ask, they tell us to talk to the supervisor. In Phoenix - I only asked - Why do you only open the check in only two hours before flights - the answer i received was .. Do you want to talk to my supervisor? It is very rude and weird that we cannot have a simple conversation with Frontier staff at check in. In Denver staff on gate A40 doing the boarding were very unprofessional, rude, they yelled at anyone who asked them questions. Our plane was selected for a security check. Although it is a common procedure for airline company and staff, the customers are not familiar with the process. When someone asked about the estimate time our flight would leave, we the lady screamed at us ""I DO NOT KNOW - MAYBE 30 MINUTES, 2 HOURS, 3 HOURS"". It was terrible. The only person who smile and was professional during my whole flight was the flight attendant Diamond on flight F9 290. I told her thanks for having a smile on your face. She told me  ""We need to keep smiling"".  I am not sure about how much the flight ticket with Frontier cost because I flew from Tampa to Phoenix with American Airlines and I flew back to Tampa with Frontier and I paid for round trip. I heard that Frontier flight tickets are cheap. I am not sure if it is true because America Airlines only charged me $30.00 for check in a bag. Carry on was free. While Frontier charged $50.00 for check in + $50.00 for carry on. Also, American Airlines offered free snacks and drinks. While Frontier charges $3.00 for drinks and snacks. I am positive I will never fly with Frontier again"

I told myself on my last flight with Frontier that I would never fly frontier again because they cancelled my flight last minute and after driving 6 hours to another airport they delayed my flight 8 hours for “the plane to be serviced.” Once again, my flight was delayed several times, causing everyone to wait at the airport for hours, then they finally cancelled it leaving everyone stranded and the Frontier lines wrapped around the airport. Long story short, insurance does not matter. Their insurance only covers “incidents that happen on the aircraft”. They put me on a flight 36 hours later but gave me a free 100$ voucher that I will not be using because I will never fly Frontier again."

New flight time 2.40pm arriving around 4.36pm. I just got home from overseas and was trying to surprise my boys ages 2 and 1 at a birthday party that's ruined. This Airline has no respect for peoples time at all, I might as well not even have a flight schedule. They need to offer a partial refund or something. I usually fly Delta or American but thought I would give the little guy a chance. Never again, worst mistake I could have made. I guess you get what you pay for. Please please save yourself the headache and fly with a more reputable airline. This will definitely be my first and last time flying Frontier."

I sent an email to Frontier regarding this matter but never hear back from them. I called them on Thursday October 31 at 8:30 and was on hold for 20 minutes before talking to Carl who told me that electronics are not covered. He then sent me over to Jeff at 9:05 am to said that he would look over it. In the meantime he sent me over to baggage. I talked to staff at 9:35 am who told me that it would not be covered. In the future I will be avoiding Frontier Airlines for their terrible customer service of not getting back to customers and being put on hold for an hour."

They told me I can reschedule but the next available flight won't leave until October 29th. They refused to aid in hotel or food following the next two days. So everything came out of pocket. I arrived back at the airport on October 29th 2019. four hours before my flight at 7am to talk to the staff before the flight check in time but no one was at the check in counters. so I waited around for two hours before they told me that the flight was delayed until 1:38pm but i still checked in my bags because I HAD to make it to Denver. So I stuck around went thru security just to be told that my flight has been canceled again and again they told me the next flight will not leave until October 31 at 1am. You think thats bad! Well it gets worse, they lost my check in bags. So for the next two days i had no clean clothing, toothbrush etc. They had no idea where my bags have gone. They told me ""it might be in Kansas"" but they didn't call anyone. They continued to tell me that i most likely would not get a refund so I might as well stick with the flight that is leaving October 31 at 1 am. I have spent over $360 in hotel rooms and thats not including food. I spent $80 for check in bags that the airlines ended up losing and all together I have spent over 24+ hours waiting around at the airport for flights that end up getting canceled at the last second.

They claim they have no agreements I told them they do have an agreement once they took my money and told me they would get me to Austin today. I have to sleep at the airport because they will not pay for a hotel. They lied that it was due to the weather when we could see them through the glass working on the plane before they allowed us to board because it was due to maintenance not weather. They refused to pay for my dinner knowing I had to wait 18 hours before I could get on the next Frontier plane to Austin. They told me they could get me to Austin today on Southwest so I said go ahead and print me out a ticket and the lady told me I would have to go to the Southwest counter and pay with my own money.

This airline is terrible and I would recommend anyone choose any other airline over this one. I flew from Salt Lake City to Austin with a small bag that fits easily into an overhead compartment without any charge or issues. When I flew back I was called to a podium for a seat adjustment and I was told I had to pay 60 dollars to carry my bag onto the flight. The woman was rude and I explained to her that I flew to Austin with no fee or problem and she insisted I pay the fee. Like a fool I paid the fee on their app and waited to board the plane. My flight was was boarding at the adjacent gate to where I was called for the seat adjustment and the demand for paying their fee. The man took my boarding pass and didn't even check or look at the bags I had. I was basically robbed for 60 dollars but this airline.

I tried contacting the airline to help me switch it but refused and said the seat was non exchangeable or refundable and the lady was very rude about it.

They lost our luggage, including our daughters car seat. They didn’t have any backup car seats (like they are supposed to, or at least like you would expect from any airline for situations like this) and our flight was delayed and didn’t land until all other airlines in that terminal were closed. We had to sIt in an empty baggage claim (with our 9 month old) until 4:30am (over three hours after landing). At that point, some baggage handlers from another airline noticed us and were kind enough to give us a car seat so we could finally get home. Customer service doesn’t care and I have sent multiple emails to the baggage department. One to complain but also to compliment one of their baggage handlers who, honestly, did everything she could to help us. They won’t even respond to all knowledge my emails. Worst customer service I have ever experienced."

I travel nationally and internationally 4-5 times a year. Had to fly on short notice and made the mistake of trying this god aweful airline. What a poor experience. You can arrive on time and they will refuse to issue boarding passes. When I finally got my boarding pass, it says doors close 15 mins before take off time. Why can’t I get my boarding pass 44 mins ahead of time? It took me 10 mins to get through security. So, I could have been at the boarding gate 34 mins before departure and 19 mins before doors close. I ended up being charged $120 for rescheduling and had to $110 for a hotel and wasted 12+ hours. Never again on this airline and will advise anyone and everyone to stay away from this pathetic air service. Their policies are not customer friendly. I am pretty sure they oversell their flights and then screw customers to make up for it. The in flight service is as pathetic as their other services. After my flight, I checked airline rankings, and guess what? The rank at the very bottom of the stack. Spirit, the previous bottom feeder, seems to be improving. Frontier took their spot. Congrats!

I had purchased a ticket online with my points (yes, a member), because of illness, I had to change the ticket. I have previously changed tickets online. Because the first ticket used more points than the second ticket, the online system would not allow this change. So, I call them only to speak to someone who was rude and very aggressive. She would not listen and just kept saying that it was going to cost a $119 change fee (the ticket didn't even cost this amount if I were to buy it brand new). They have never charged to change a ticket purchased with points. She forwards my call to ""another department"" but before she does so, I ask for her name and ID#, she states that she is not allowed to give this information and it is against policy (probably because of rudeness). I speak to Mike who does the same thing. You must pay $119 to change your ticket, etc. etc. I refuse. I have done this before without a fee. He finally states that I could just cancel my original purchase and he would refund my money and I can go online and buy the new ticket! Each time these things happen, I just start looking at other ways to travel."

They refused and offered $75 travel vouchers. I declined told them to keep it. They cost passengers more than they save on their rates. Don’t do it! Cheaper to fly a different airline.

I had zero luggage, however, so check those fees (sent my bag ahead with family who flew out earlier). Plane looked new (per tail number, 3 years old). Landed on time. Friendly crew. Seat was a bit thin. Tray table tiny. No free drinks. Happy to accept those minor drawbacks on a short haul flight in order to get that price. I would fly Frontier more often if their network out of DFW was better. I also stressed ahead of time because I knew it may be hard to get there had the flight been cancelled (American has more re-route options). Fortunately not cancelled.

The gate clerk disappeared for 2 hours and wouldn't answer any questions. At 10 p.m., five hours past departure they kept saying they had no information and it was finally midnight when they announced a cancellation of flight. From there it was pure chaos. Since it was so late, no other flights were available on any other airline. Flights out of Frontier wouldn't be for another 2 days. People were completely stranded. It took 2 additional hours - now 2 a.m. in the morning before we we had to book a flight with another airline the following day costing $1500 out of pocket for flights back home plus $20 cab and $120 hotel. We had a 7-year-old autistic child with us. This was a horrible experience for her. Autistic children are very sensitive to noise, crowds, bright lights. What was supposed to be less than 2 hour stay in airport ended up being 10 hours, and extremely detrimental to her sensory processing disorder. It was a truly awful experience and will never fly Frontier again."

My seat was the front seat as well. I walked in with my ear buds- Unfortunately I’m coming home to Utah to burry my 4 year old nephew. The FA says- your bags need to go overhead. I was in the very front row, so you can’t keep purses or backpacks or anything big with you. I said, without taking my earbuds out “I know I’ll put it up for the flight”. Keep in mind my tote with purchases were already stored up too. Next thing in know, the guy- says “your bag needs to go up top (keep in mind we have 20-25 minutes before take off). And I told him “I just told her I’d put it up in time for take off”. He then says “that’s the attitude”. When I said “excuse me, what is your name” He got so close to my face. He said “oh are we gonna have a problem it’s Fox(his name)” He then accosted me about me earbuds and how I was being disrespectful. So I started to record him, when he accused me of taking his photo. Which I then did. A few minutes go by and I decide to be the bigger person - delete the recording. I go up to be the bigger person and apologize and he pushes me to the side and I start to apologize when he yells at me to stop talking. He needs a witness. Then the first FA and another lady show up. I then am told to take my seat. After he tells me I’ve broken the law and will be arrested. I sit down. Within minutes I’m pulled off the aircraft and told that if I do not listen to him I’m not allowed back on. And it’s his decision to let me back on the plane."

I had the worst experience and am still living it. I originally had a flight from SFO to dulles with a connection in Denver. Tuesday was the day I was supposed to leave then I keep getting emails that my flight is delayed and when I called them the lady said if you get on this plane then you will miss your connecting flight from Denver to Dulles because the flight to Denver is delayed and the only next available flight is on Thursday. I take the Thursday flight. As my husband and I arrive at the airport we are told our 10:33am flight is now delayed to 11:20am. We get on the plane and we are on the runway until 12pm. Once we reach Denver at 2:45 they are on the runway until 3:28pm. My connecting flight from Denver to Dulles was planned to depart by 3:45 and was scheduled for them to close the plane doors by 3:30. By the time I get off the plane the doors for my connecting flight closed. I called Frontier and they said there is no flight to Dulles, Reagan or even Baltimore airport and that the next flight is on Sunday where its the same flight to Denver then Dulles. They didn't provide a hotel voucher or anything for us to be in Denver for 2 days. The only option they had was to either rebook and refund the money where then you are responsible for buying yourself a new plane ticket. Mind you last minute tickets especially last day ones are about 1000 dollars a person. Also I am a full time college student and cannot afford to be in a state where I am not a resident along with staying at a hotel for 2 days. So I asked them take me back to San Francisco I can stay with my parents and book me on the next flight to Dulles. The soonest flight they have is Sunday. I had to fly back to San Francisco and on my SFO flight we were on the runway for 1 whole hour and this truck drove up to the plane and it pulled out a water pipe then started washing the plane wings. We arrived 50 minutes late to SFO. Also the bags that were on the flight from San Francisco to Denver when I tried going to Dulles. Turns out none of those bags made it to Dulles airport that night so we ended up getting our bags back and they expect us to pay again for our carry on and checked bag on Sunday. When we were at Denver heading back to SFO they changed our gate 4 times. Never again flying with frontier this is a complete joke. They deserve to get shutdown. Do yourselves a favor do not give in to low prices on Frontier go on legitimate airlines like Alaska or Delta they will not waste your time."

As a result my I flew out Sunday night - adding a hotel bill to my vacation cost. I have sent an email to the CEO and other officers at the airlines. I did get a call from someone at the airline - I am not sure whose office she said she was from - who said she would send me an email with information to send my hotel bill but as of today (October 10, 2019) I have not received an email nor have I received any acknowledgement from the CEO.

She gave me a slip of paper to call for a refund which was great. So when I called they told me they couldn't give me a refund because the lady didn't leave any comments saying that.

It's been a complete run-around the entire time. My husband and I are on vacation and unfortunately, we had a death in the family so we need to return home two days earlier than planned. We called to change the flight, they said we couldn't. We had to go book a separate flight then call them back to cancel the original flight. We did, they said they couldn't refund us the money, they could only credit us for another flight. But they told us that they couldn't do that the first time we called. If they did that the first time, we wouldn't have had to book a whole new flight. We could have used that credit for the new flight that we needed to book. So after spending God knows how much money on all of this, we still have to send a copy of our family member's death certificate over to them. Then we're told that we have to scan the death certificate in the airport we flew into for vacation .. are you joking? So I have to fly home to PA, get the death certificate, fly back to FL to scan it, wait until they get it, then fly home? This is the worst airline I've ever flown and they charge you for every last thing. The checked bags, the carry-ons, the seats if my husband and I wanted to sit together...I paid $96 for us to sit together on the way there and the way back. While on the plane, I think they asked maybe one time if anyone wanted snacks or drinks. Any other airline I've ever flown walked up and down the aisle the entire flight asking if we wanted snacks or drinks. They made sure we had whatever we needed. But that's not even the important part. We had a death in the family and we've been given nothing but problems trying to arrange our flights to get to the funeral. This is something that should be an easy fix due to the unfortunate circumstances. But no, they are making it increasingly difficult just for us to make it home for the funeral.

Instead the pilot stated we had plenty of gas because he new we would be circling for some time before landing. The flight was never allowed to land in Chicago, Chicago closed the airport at around 5:30 PM due to weather. Our flight should have been 3 hours. It ended up being 7 hours. 5 hours into the flight the pilot announced no other airport had available customs open to accept our flight so we had to fly to Denver. Arriving at Denver airport, we were made to find our own way to customs, 120 people had to stand in line at 11:00PM to rebook our luggage for another flight, then rebook our ticket for the next day. This took a couple of hours. No representation from the airline ever came to announce what the plan was. Instead the passengers were all asking each other. I must also add the flight consisted of 2 offers for water. 7 hour flight and they did not offer us snacks or complimentary drink due to the delay. Nothing but water. At 2:00am we realized we were sleeping at the airport. No offer of a blanket or pillow. Most of us were in shorts and sandals. It was 47 degrees in Colorado. Really think about flying with this airline. I did call customer service to see if they were willing to offer any retribution for our troubles. She said no, but they will due better on their customer service in the future. Sorry Frontier. You have lost my business."

Closing doors time stated it would be 1:16pm. I arrived at gate 2 min before (1:14pm). I was greeted with a scowl look from the gate attendant. She was visibly irritated with my late arrival and clearly not interested in the fact that my uber was in a wreck on the way to the airport which delayed my arrival. Without making eye contact .. she asked me my name and informed me that I needed to pay again for the bag fee. I informed her that the lady prior to security check told me that there would not be an additional fee. There was another gentleman that arrived after me. He was sweating and he obviously was running to make it to the gate. The agent saw him running and she stated that there comes another one and he has a bag. She rolled her eyes. He asked ""did i make it?"" No one acknowledged him. I answered him. 'Yes you did. Are you ok?"" I asked the agent if there was a reason she was so visibly irritated .. she answered with ""this isn't irritated. This is how I always am"". I informed her that she should not be in the field of customer service. She told me that she had been in customer service for 4 years. I informed her that her supervisor should be aware of her behavior. She answered: ""My supervisor knows how I am"". What total disregard for the passenger experience. Once I was boarded, I logged onto Frontier's website and sent in my concern. I received an email from a Customer Relations Specialist apologizing and stating the concern about the lack of customer care had been sent to the supervisor. This Customer Relations Specialist pulled the ""policy"" card regarding needing to pay again for a bag if checked at the gate. She ended the email with ""we look forward to seeing you again"". Nope.

First thing, the check-in kiosks were broken, so there was a really long line to check-in.

They say they will send you a $500 voucher in an email but what they do is send you one for $100 and you have to call in to get the rest of the voucher. The voucher itself is only good for 90 days!

San Juan to Atlanta. This is the worst possible flight experience imaginable. The flight was delayed 2 hours before we were given any answer as to why. Then the response was that the airplane was rerouted somewhere else because of weather in Puerto Rico, while  no other flights around us were delayed for weather. Then our flight, almost 4 hours delayed, lets us know that what was suppose to be a direct flight, would have to do a layover in Orlando. When asked at the gate why, they said it was to refuel but when we called Frontier they said it was because of weather in Atlanta, and when we actually board they said it was because our flight crew had reached it's daily hourly limit and we had to have a crew change in Orlando so we could make it. So it took 3 tries for Frontier to tell the truth: that 4 hours isn't enough for them to organize themselves and find a replacement crew in Puerto Rico instead of wasting fuel and time and probably a plane full of customers and adding a stop to a direct flight. Then what was suppose to be a 4 hours flight was a 9 hour ordeal and to add insult to injury we asked if we could at least get a glass of water or coffee and the flight attendants said no because it was out of policy. I've read the reviews and heard all my friends complaining about this airline, but since it was the only real direct flight from Atlanta with a semi-affordable price, I booked it. So on my first flight with Frontier I learned the following: they will lie to you to save face and give no direct answers to what is happening, they will have inadequate planning and are disorganized when it comes to unforeseen issues, they have ZERO compensation for screwing over their customers (not even a glass of water), and just because you pay for a direct flight doesn't meant that is what you are getting. It's incompetent and irresponsible."

My Norwegian flight from Paris to Denver was delayed by an hour - I even received a notification. When we arrived in Denver, it took about 20 minutes to get off the plane, followed by another 20 minutes to retrieve bags and go through customs before checking in to my connecting flight. I get to the Frontier Airlines kiosk and the agent told me I could not board the aircraft 30 minutes before departure - yet in their terms and conditions, it says that passengers are allowed to board up to 30 minutes before departure - either this agent was purposely making this experience hell for me, or was a complete idiot and had no idea how to do his job. I tried explaining to them that my flight was delayed and I had come up to the kiosk as fast as I could after having to wait through customs and baggage claim. The agent alongside him said I needed to calm down and that I was flabbergasted - no regard nor understanding to the frustration after flying 11 hours, and then being told I would not make my connecting flight and that ""it's not their fault I missed my flight"". The agent also said that they do not receive any notifications at the kiosk about delayed connecting flights, which I find absolutely absurd. They told me I needed to go speak with a manager but there was no one to be found at the moment. I spoke with Spirit Airlines next door, they said I would have to pay for a new flight if I were to fly with them - but that I could attempt asking the manager from Frontier Airlines if they could assist with that. The manager was now at the kiosk at Frontier, and her presence, attitude, and tone of voice was the worst I have ever experienced at an airport. She was extremely rude, and would not even listen to anything I tried to explain and kept dismissing every sentence without thought. She was robotic in tone of voice and did not care at all about what happened with my flight, and blamed me for missing the flight and that there was nothing they could do. I left crying out of frustration and rudeness that I experienced from that so-called ""manager"" - it's a mystery as to how someone with such a horrible attitude and personality would have that role. I had to buy a new ticket from another airline, as well as transportation and hotel for the night since they had no other flights to offer me. This airline doesn't care about it's customers, nor do they offer any type of class in their customer service. What a disgrace."

There is a reason Frontier has the lowest customer satisfaction ratings (and by lowest, I mean the rock bottom friends). The ""flight attendants"" are mainly just teenagers who can do little more than handle three main things. Seatbelts. Trash. No loitering. It takes one whole flight attendant for each category. We spent the better part of three hours toward the front, watching four flight attendants do the following: eat oatmeal, drink various items (which you won't get on this airline unless you're willing to hand over your card for a $4.00 Coke). We're suspicious that the fourth person was actually just a passenger dressed like one of them. Nothing is free and the only time we saw actual activity from them was when one went down the aisle saying ""trash?"" while another followed at the same time saying 'seatblets?' The third one spent about an hour moving soda into one cart and back again (because no one wants a $4.00 Coke). Clearly these folks aren't at the top of their multitasking class. Their seats honestly feel like you are sitting on stadium seats. You know, the hard metal bleaches that cause your butt to fall asleep after an hour? I did say a silent prayer that at least while it's numb, it didn't hurt. Aside from the pilot managing to get this plane and passengers to its destination (I mean, that's really as low as the bar can go), there is nothing redeemable about this airline. Do yourself a favor and spend the additional $60 (on average) to fly a major airline. Even United looks like a five-star experience compared to this airline."

Frontier Airlines seems to try to present themselves as a budget airline, but charge astronomical fees. I have consistently seen very rude employees in personal experiences with Frontier Airlines. They entice you with low fares, but I have seen them raise their prices before I can complete a booking. I have also seen error messages on their website when trying to book their ""low"" costs. When I go back to try again; the error has mysteriously vanished and the prices have gone up significantly. I have had numerous conversations with their customer service agents on the phone, and they are extremely rude and have even hung up on me. My family and I have been mistreated and humiliated at the boarding gate as well as observing the poor treatment of other Frontier Airline customers."

I read a lot of reviews concerning Frontier before deciding to give them a try. I am disabled and traveled with my personal mobility scooter. It was transported in the baggage compartment and I was able to ride it to the aircraft door and they then placed in baggage and delivered it to the aircraft door upon arrival. It was handled professionally and with care. Flight attendants were most helpful. In fact, the entire crew were great about keeping us informed on flight status and progress. Aircraft was clean and well maintained. I have no problem with charges for baggage. The overall cost was a bargain compared to competitors. Lack of free drinks and pretzels on a 2-hour flight was not a problem. I will not hesitate to recommend Frontier to friends and family. Just do your research and know what to expect."

One of the worst if not the worst airline I flew with during my 20 or more years of flying. The flight was delayed for more than 2 hours with no explanation to why it’s delayed. If you want to fly cheap fly with a different airline. At least you’ll get to your destination on time.
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Seattle via Denver,August 2019,4.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,3,"  Cancun to Seattle via Denver. The problem I had with this airline is that I was asked to check-in online and told that if I did so I would save money, especially if I bundled the options: bags, carryons, seats. So I did. Or I tried to. I am not unfamiliar with making arrangements online but had problems with navigating the site. I think I had to try three times, but at least twice, for everything to go through. I noticed that they were listing my flight as ""roundtrip"" even though it was Cancun to Denver to Seattle. The charges were astronomical. I ended up paying $254.12 at check-in on top of the $191.24 I had paid for the flight itself. And this is supposed to be a discount airline? So, at the airport I checked with the agent at the counter as I checked my one bag, total charges $86.24 instead of the accustomed $25-30. And I had to pay another $86.24 for the carry-on, which I have never had to pay for. The agent checked the record and told me that I should call Customer Service when I got home because it looked like I had been overcharged. So I called Customer Service and gave them the confirmation number so they could check the charges and I am informed that they had to charge twice because I did not have a connecting flight! What? So I asked if every other person my the flight from Cancun to Denver who then continued to a second destination had to pay the same fee for each ""flight"" and I was told that ""yes"" they all would have paid the same fees! Rather than argue I chose to pass the word around. No way I will fly Frontier again, that's for certain. I have been inundated by emails from them about $29 specials and wondered how they could offer such cheap airfare. Now it becomes clear! It was an interesting experience, no beverage service, no wifi, no nothing. The seats were not uncomfortable. No significant delays. Weird having to deplane to the tarmac at Seatac and walk a very long way to get baggage after the buses drop us off at the far end of the main terminal. But all the walking outside was on-ramps, no stairs. To get value from this airline, don't have checked bags or carry-on (they allow one personal item free) and take the seat they give you! Bring your own food and drinks, a blanket and a pillow, noise-cancelling headphones, a book, and you will be fine."

Their server confirmed I checked in then their system said I didn’t ,and they forced us to miss our flight and buy all new tickets ($2100 to fly from Philadelphia to Tampa Florida). On the flight home they messed up again and wouldn’t allow me to check in because of a $30 fee due and I called and asked how I owed money when I already paid in full and they said sorry it was a mistake, you're good to fly home now. I called to speak with them about this and they were rude and obnoxious and told me their system is perfect and no way they made a mistake. Spend the few bucks extra for a better flight!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Philadelphia,August 2019,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Savannah to Philadelphia. This airline is the worse at every turn they work at disappointing their customers. Some businesses fail to meet customers expectations by mistake. Frontier must hold meetings to discuss how best to provide a completely horrible experience. Delays, failure to communicate, rude employees to name but a very few events a trip with Frontier has provided us. At this time I stand in a line that was to start moving an hour ago waiting for baggage check. Better off with any other airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Ontario,August 2019,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,3,no,4,  San Antonio to Ontario. The lady at the counter at San Antonio airport didn't seem to have knowledge of anything. She got my flight confused and sent my car seat to the wrong place. When I landed in Ontario they had to provide me a loaner car seat. Thankfully within 24 hours customer service called and had my car seat. I didn't have time to go pick it up so I just switched it back when I returned for my departure back to San Antonio. I asked the girl in Ontario if everything was good with the car seat. She never specified to me to pick up car seat on the side entrance. When I arrived in San Antonio I waited at baggage claim for my car seat and once again it was not to be found. I was quite upset and had to go talk to customer service representative. The customer service representative blamed me for not picking up my car seat in the correct section when the ticket given to me clearly stated baggage claim. The lady was quite rude and offered terrible help. Eventually after 40 minutes I got my car seat. I think next time when choosing my flight I'll just go with a different one. I also don't like the fact that the company charges for carry on bags and had no complimentary drinks on board.

Worst airline experience ever, and I have flown a lot. Most of the seats don't recline, they have no padding, and the armrest sticks out when folded up so we couldn't even lean sideways on each other without being stuck in the ribs. What executive decided it was a good idea to forego the passengers comfort to save a few dollars? I am going to semd Frontier my chiropractor bill. I definitely need to go after flying with Frontier. The icing on the cake was $45 per carry on bag, per leg of the trip. I won't ever fly Frontier again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Las Vegas,August 2019,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Philadelphia to Las Vegas. Our vacation to Las Vegas was ruined by Frontier Airlines when the Pilot never showed up to the flight due to a scheduling error. Which was bad enough, but their customer service to make up for the extremely inconvenient situation was even worse. We dealt with at least 4-5 customer service agents who where horrible at providing any type of satisfactory resolution. Nobody from that company was willing to do whatever it took to make the situation right for us, we had to fight and complain to everyone we dealt with. Our flight tickets were over $300 each and they were only willing to provide travel vouchers for $500 - we lost hotel reservations and an RV rental worth way more than that. I am NEVER using this company again, no matter what the ""Deal"" looks like - they are not worth it."

Waited an hour to find out there not going to help me on to a different flight on a different airline, any flight vouchers, miles or even a life back home! On top of that, the manager was billing the passengers repeating, two options. Refund or rebook! What jerks had to spend another $400 to book on United Airline. Ugh"

Had booked trip 3 months ago to visit family and to have my daughter meet her grandmother. We received notification flight was delayed 15 mins on way to airport, then when we printed boarding passes it said delayed until 7pm. Then once again it was changed to 6pm then 5 minutes later canceled. When we went to get explanation none was given, just telling us to book with another airline and they maybe would reimburse us up to a certain dollar amount. But roundtrips were 400 plus a person and no direct flights but no one at frontier cares. I learned my lesson and will never fly with them again and will never recommend them to anyone. Horrible customer service and for a airline not to have a contingency plan is inexcusable."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Philadelphia,August 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Houston to Philadelphia. Frontier Airlines is cheap, but they are cheaper than you think. The staff tried to send us back from the check-in counter. They tried to sell their tickets for the next day, meanwhile tried to sell our seats to someone waiting at the gate for the last minute tickets. Overall they cheated us, tried to steal from us and tried to sell the stolen goods to someone else as well. Misconduct by the staff. Frontier airlines staff at the check-in counter misinformed us about TSA service hours and asked us to go back.  She also tried to sell Frontier air tickets for the next day. We would even doubt that she took 15 minutes and it was intentional to delay us. Misconduct by the airlines manager 1. When the customer asked for resolution the manager stepped in. He also misinformed us about TSA service hours and asked us to go back.  The manager did not correct his staff’s mistake but instead he covered it up by arguing with us. The manager just brought up a reason that we were informed to check in early and refused to help. Both the staff and the manager explicitly said “TSA at Houston IAH airport stopped working at 11.30pm”. They also said “there is no way you are going to fly in the Frontier flight tonight”. TSA service at one terminal was closed, but we cleared the TSA check, reached the gate 2 hours before the departure and boarded the flight. The manager was there to board us. Therefore the information they gave us was wrong. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Las Vegas,August 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Had to cancel my whole vacation this past weekend by booking Frontier. Boarded plane ready to take off then turned around and de-boarded plane. Not weather related but had communication issues within plane. Told once it was fixed then not fixed, delayed 4 hrs, then finally cancelled. Tried to find another flight only to be severely disappointed with cost increases for last minute and expensive airlines. Next Frontier flight of course 2 days later giving me not even 24 hrs at my destination. Customer service less than satisfactory considering they ruin one of the few times I take time off (unpaid as well!). After already spending 9 hours in the airport and on the plane, they'll try to impress you with a one night stay in a 2 star hotel (only after a lot of insisting), offer you a future $500 travel voucher (for two people, NOT one) as if you are excited to book your next flight with them and end up costing you hotel cancellation fees, your weekend, wages, time, and much needed vacation. Save yourself the trouble and fly Southwest whenever possible. Have flown with Southwest the most and now I remember why. No delays, no cancellations, and no problems. First time flying (or trying to fly) with Frontier was my last time trying to fly with Frontier! May as well drive! You'll get there quicker and enjoy your vacation."

When finishing my purchase, apparently the airline offered me and alternate flight for different date that I didn't catch on their website. I was sent an email on the confirmation of my flight about five minutes later and realized that the flight was on the wrong date and time. I called a representative not even a minute later to let them know what happen and the only solution they had for me is to cancel the flight and receive a Airline credit and by the way you have to pay an additional 25 dollars to cancel flight in order to receive the Airline credit. I'm truly done with Frontier Airlines, they are truly the worst airline in the Continental US. Beware of doing business with this carrier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Denver,August 2019,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was not a flight my partner and I were able to get on, per day. We flew Frontier from Denver to Albuquerque and on August 12, arrived at the Albuquerque airport to fly back to Denver via Frontier. We arrived at the airport at 12:35 pm, and had already received a text at 13:16 pm stating “Travel Alert!! Frontier flight 630 leaving from Albuquerque is delayed. Departure now estimated at 14:22.” We proceeded to go through security and the monitor confirmed the delayed flight time. We decided to eat at a restaurant in the airport due to the delay. After, we checked the monitor again and it still verified the delay. We arrived at the gate at 1:35 pm. The check-in desk screen said the flight was delayed. We sat down waiting for an update but none came. Eventually we wandered around looking for a Frontier associate but were told that we would have to exit security to speak to someone at the initial check-in desk. Before this, we checked the flight status online for an update and it said the plane departed at 2 pm, even though we arrived to the gate 25 minutes before this time and there were no final boarding calls. We left the secured area and headed to the Frontier ticketing counter, but there were no more flights going out and no Frontier employees on-site. After a long phone call with Frontier, they are reimbursing our flight, but the only other flights out through other carriers were $548 or more (with a 22 hour layover in Seattle). We settled on $612 a piece for a one-way flight from Albuquerque to Minneapolis. I will never fly Frontier again and I will gladly pay for a somewhat more expensive flight to avoid going through them. Terrible experience."

I flew with Frontier Airlines in the past and my experience was always fine. This time I was flying a route my family and I took every year, Chicago - Cancun. I am an aviation geek as you might call it, so I caught that are flight was going to be delayed by an hour tops the night before. We got to the airport on time and waited as the time kept getting pushed back. It left 4 hours late at the end of the ordeal. The people who stood by the desk by the gate were useless. They only tried to act helpful by putting up boarding signs, even though we didn't leave for hours after that. Frontier has a policy where if you are delayed for 4 hours or more you will get a voucher. Everyone got a $10 lunch voucher! Which is outrageous, especially at O'Hare! When we landed Frontier Airlines gave everyone a $50 gift card that expired in a few months. Most people on that flight were chartered from Apple Vacations or FunJet Vacations. They wasted 12 hours of valuable time! 7 Hours at the airport, 3 in the air, 1 in the airport, and 1 in the car. We were supposed to get to the resort at 1 PM, we got there at 7 PM!"

My daughter’s late night Thursday flight was cancelled. Frontier only provided partial payment toward the resulting need for a hotel stay, and re-booked her on a late flight for Sat. She checked in early, sat at the gate, fell asleep after checking her flight was in time and set her alarm accordingly, but her flight was moved up, and she missed it. She was out of funds, asked for help with rescheduling and received absolutely no attempts at assistance from staff to help her find a solution to the issue created first by the cancelled flight and then by the second changed flight schedule. Would it have been too hard to wake the sleeping girl sitting at their gate for a midnight flight? Or, If they had even tried to look online after she missed it they could have found her cheaper flights in Frontier’s own airline to help her get home. But no one bothered. Customer service and compassion should be present. How sad it can’t be expected from this company:"

There is zero customer service, the employees do not care about anything other than their cell phones. They just plain do not care & the fact that they have 2/10 (I would give negative if that were an option), yet they have done nothing to improve, shows the upper management’s level of concern for the consumers who pay their salaries. Trip was booked through a travel agent & unfortunately, we will not use him again either, primarily due to the entire Frontier experience."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Denver,August 2019,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I was online trying to add a checked bag to my flight and I somehow accidentally cancelled my flight. I immediately called back and advised them of the mistake. I spoke to 5 different people and I escalated it all the way to customer relations. They all advised me that regardless if it was an accident that I would have to pay an additional $311 to keep my flight. I was shocked. They then tried to charge me $10 for making the change through representative. I strongly recommend paying extra to book through any other airline. It is not worth the small savings you get by going through Frontier. I have never been the victim of a policy like this that is enforced regardless of circumstance and will never be flying Frontier again.

Finally, one of the 3 waved their hands for us to come over just to tell us we were late the flight leaves at 1230 and we had only 29 minutes. They proceeded to say they can not check us in since we had to check in bags. I let them know we had no bags to check. One agent turned the computer screen with the supervisor there for us to see in clear view of other people in the path of the screen. The screen contained real time seating charts and they pointed at the screen to tell me the flight was overbooked so they could not help me anyway. I asked for a later flight or the next morning but they said I had to buy a flight with a different airline. The flight ended up leaving late at 1250. I called frontier customer service and the agent on the phone just kept on repeating a script, telling me i was late.  I had to purchase new flights with a different airline. I raised concerns to frontier management about the customer service and about showing a passenger real time seating charts. They stated they will note things down but only could do that. Ultimately, offered no real solution. Out money and time. Phl is very clique and frontier is terrible at all things airline services. Do not recommend."

I flew Frontier years ago when they were the Cadillac of airlines. Now they in my opinion are not very good. I purchase bag and boarding passes but when at airport they did not have kiosks to check baggage , had to wait in line 1-1/2 hours for someone to check my baggage and tag it. Then even though they had seat assigned they loaded weird first passenger's that paid for full baggage then passenger that paid for carry on then the rest instead of by row. The seats were terribly uncomfortable. They were hard narrow and did not recline. You had to pay for better seats. The seat I had was dirty and pocket and floor food spilled all over. Then snacks you had to pay for anything other than water. I would not recommend this airline there are better discount airlines."

At first, the flight price was reasonable until you start to look into the price of baggage and seating. I pre-paid online for my bags and paid additional costs to be able to sit in the first row to give more room for my ESA who is a well trained GSD that has flown a dozen times with other airlines and never had an issue. Other than the costs, what really was distasteful was after I was aboard the plane the attendants made me aware I would be unable to sit in the front row even though I paid for it because I had an animal. I told them I paid extra and hadn’t ever had issues with this before. Half the attendants agreed with me and half said it was a new policy just this week. No one could give me a straight answer other than they needed to find me a different seat. I was very put off by this because I have followed all the rules and even paid additional fees to be sure I was accommodated and yet, the attendants didn’t seem confident in the actual policy themselves. I don’t recommend Frontier not only because of hidden fees but because of the disorganization and failure to accommodate those who actually follow all policies. Southwest has always gone above and beyond for myself and my ESA so I regret my decision to try a new airline. Hope this helps someone out."

I waited in line for almost 2 hours just to get to the frontier rep. Horrible customer service. They had no valid reason why flight was delayed except technical issues. They donot care about their customers or their customer’s time. A gentleman in line had an overweight bag which they made him pay for the extra lbs. They could have just let him take those few lbs without having to pay that extra money as a way of compensation for the 3 hr pls delay of flight. Horrible! Donot fly Frontier!"

First of all, if all the flights had been on time, I would like to know how we were expected to leave at 6:15 when our flight attendants were not expected to land until 6:25. Not surprisingly there flight arrived 40 minutes later then the scheduled 6:25. At this point we are noticing a theme that all flights with Frontier have been delayed due to what seems to be poor scheduling and even the pilots were extremely frustrated. Every person between TSA, stand in flight attendants, pilots and passengers were extremely frustrated with the lack of communication and issues that seemed like they could've been avoided from the start. I have never had such a bad experience flying from Salt Lake to Boston before. These issues definitely seemed to be avoidable and even if they weren't, the communication and empathy for our frustrations could've been a lot better since there was a definite lack of both. Due to the great inconvenience and horrible service, I am requesting to have a refund credited to my card that I had purchased the tickets from.  Our experience was so awful we will never be flying with Frontier Airlines again. This was absolutely unacceptable."

On July 22, 2019 I went to the airport to board my flight from Denver to Washington Dulles. When I arrived I found out the flight had been canceled. There was no explanation why. When I went to customer service at the airport they handed us a piece of paper which said we could get a refund on our ticket Or a book a new ticket and they would reimburse up to $500 in two weeks. The result was after speaking with other passengers that everyone who did not live in Denver or surrounding lost some of their own money even though this was not their fault. My flight cost $560 in addition I had to lay that money out and send documents and I’m now hoping in two weeks I will get $500 back. There was a car option to drive but no hotel option. A woman sitting in front of me on the United flight I rebooked to get home that day told me she spent 100 or more dollars of her own money. I would really like to know how this is even legal. They sent us a coupon code for $100 on a flight. The people I spoke with all said they will never fly Frontier again"

I have flown countless times on various airlines, including budget airlines in Thailand, Guatemala, and Panama, and have never had such a horrendous experience. After being delayed over an hour we finally boarded our plane, I was content thinking my checked bag was safe and sound under the plane. It is nice boarding with a small personal item not having to find room for a carry-on bag. The flight landed late into Houston and I began the rush to the baggage claim, anxious to get some shut-eye in my own bed. After waiting for close to an hour for my bag, me and three others were left bagless. Moving upstairs we found some Frontier representatives on their phone confused as to how our bags did not arrive. Over the next three days, I was put through endless circles of atrocious outsourced customer service representatives. Throughout this time I chatted with about 20 different customer service reps and various airport staff; hearing different stories. My bag had been found and lost again once, and then permanently lost, with zero concern, assistance, or assurance from Frontier. On day four I took matters into my own hands and begun contacting airport baggage service offices. Finally, I was dealing with friendly and understanding airport (not airline) staff. I seemed confident my bag may indeed be found. Day 5. My girlfriend and I began to compile an Excel spreadsheet with all of our missing items in the checked bag with the corresponding dollar amount to bring to a Frontier supervisor at our closest airport because we still had no news about our bag. Frontier had told me every day I would receive an email and phone call within the hour pertaining to my bag and I never heard a word. Day 6. I receive a call from IAH (Houston) baggage service department that my bag had been found! Another airline sent this bag on their plane when Frontier brought it to them days later. I still never heard an apology or was refunded for any submitted expenses from Frontier. "

Unless you’re desperate go anywhere else. Terminal crew are rude and abrupt. In Flight attendants are inattentive. Bought the same drink on my flight down that my seat neighbor bought. Attendant gave her two bottles of vodka for her beverage because she in conversation she said she had five kids. Same drink he gave me one bottle. Never asked how many kids I have. (Five too) In general your tray table is too small to hold your drink and your cell phone. Seats don’t recline. By the time you pay for a carry on and anything else they nickel and dime you for, you could fly another airline. There are truly no savings on this airline in reality."

Myself, my sister, my brother and 4 more of our friends were traveling to Miami to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday. Our flight was delayed three times and then ultimately cancelled due to 'weather'. Other flights left that same airport going to that same destination without incident. If there were truly weather conditions I completely understand. However, the treatment that we received after being completely blindsided by the cancellation and devasted by not having any other options was completely absurd. Frontier airlines showed absolutely no remorse for the inconvenience that all of their passengers were facing. Trips to Paris, weddings and honey moons were also plagued by this unfortunate event. They tried to make us keep our returning flights, they were hesitant to return the money we spent on baggage and they lost one of our passengers bags. How do you lose a bag and we never left the airport. Me nor anyone in my family or friend circle will ever fly Frontier Airlines. If you are looking for whether you should or not. Please don't!"

The flight was delayed but we weren't notified until boarding started about an hour later. The guy working the gate kept ""hiding"". After boarded, went to get our seats but they were taken. The flight attendant said they overbooked and had me and my 2 daughters stand until they find us seats. We get seats and smell like burning rubber. Take off and about 20 minutes later, the pilot says we are rerouting back to Orlando because of an issue with the door. Had to deplane. Long story short, they kept saying we would fly out but then after midnight once customers started getting emails, they made an announcement they have a plane but no pilots. No flight next day available, flights after that are first come first serve. It was a chaotic mess. No one knew how to handle the situation. I specifically asked if we had to use the link they provided on paper and he replied no just screenshot your new reservation on Delta. The paper they gave us had no number to call for assistance. Paid $1200.00 out of pocket to be told a week later it'll take 4 to 6 weeks to get our money back. To sum it up, they lied, scammed, deceitful and took full advantage of us with nobody caring whatsoever."

I was given the option of staying where I was stranded and paying for three days of accommodations or getting half a refund on my ticket while I had to pay triple the price to get my one way ticket from a different airline due to the last minute cancellation. I cannot believe this is considered a legitimate business. I truly have never seen such bad business techniques in my life - agents yelling over me while I was calmly talking, rude and condescending comments, and zero apologies for the cancellation, inability to book me on another flight, and stealing koney from me. I was also on the phone with them for 5 hours total the day of the cancelled flight. Complete train wreck situation. Above all, they were dishonest and practiced slimy business the entire process. I will obviously never fly with them again but absolutely want to warn others as I would hate for more people to get taken advantage of too. In reviewing other people's reviews I came across someone who gave a ""how to survive a Frontier flight"" review. I would add to expect to be scammed, disrespected, lied to, and treated less like a customer and more like target. Don't be their next victim!"

Frontier Airlines will not allow you to check in for your flight and print boarding passes if you are not checking a bag or declaring that you have a carry on item, they make you check in at the airport and get your boarding passes from the customer service rep. My kids were flying with only one personal item each and therefore could not check in online. The website said to get to the airport 45 minutes early to check your bags and get your boarding pass. My kids having no bags to check showed up at the Frontier counter 42 minutes before their flight. The Frontier Airlines customer service rep at the Syracuse Hancock Airport refused to issue my kid's their boarding passes for a flight that was not set to depart for another 42 minutes, claiming that it was a TSA guideline that kept her from doing so. This was at an airport that two days later my family of 5 showed up to the airport, checked 2 bags and received boarding passes from two different airlines and got through security (even with two of us going through more extensive security checks) all within 10 minutes of arriving at this airport. I have arrived at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport 30 minutes before a flight and never had an issue getting my boarding pass or getting on my flight, but then again I had not tried that with a Frontier flight. The Frontier Airlines rep is not a TSA employee and therefore should have issued the boarding passes and then if TSA had a problem with the time they arrived they could have handled it. This was unacceptable behavior and we are out almost $700.00 for these two flights and my kid's lost two days of work. I will never fly Frontier again and with 3 of my 5 family members working at the Grand Canyon National Park we will be sure to help spread the word to the 7 million visitors we get each year."

The procedures within this organisation are dismal. At check in the have insufficient staff which leads to lines. There is no useful communication directing people where to line up when the limited ribboned areas are overflowing. The check-in process for me took 58 minutes, and I had prepaid my bags. Our flight was then delayed by 85 minutes to 9:40 but did not commence boarding until 9:45. Passengers were checked through to the sky bridge until it was full, with no air conditioning, but not onto the plane. This was due to a ‘maintenance issue’ but the procedure was not in place to either communicate a further delay or to prevent passengers being checked through to the sky bridge. There appears to be a culture of getting the job done without having a systemised procedure."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Orlando ,July 2019,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,4.0,2,no,2,"  I was recently a passenger on the flight on July 6th from Philadelphia to Orlando. On the way there we were supposed to arrive in Orlando by 4 pm. Due to their being a rain storm in Orlando, we were delayed a good while and had to stop at Tampa International Airport for more fuel. We ended up flying into the rain storm in Tampa instead of just flying to our destination in Orlando. Because of this, we did not arrive at our Disney resort until 12 am. I was fine with that since I know that this was just to ensure that we were safe rather than traveling through a storm. We knew passengers on our flight here from Philadelphia who got off in Tampa and said they would not be returning through Frontier. We were still hopeful and gave the company another chance. Then on what was supposed to be the day of our flight back, we were delayed some more. Our flight was set to leave on July 11th at 2:01 pm. We were then told that our flight had been delayed until 5pm. At about 4:36 pm we were informed that our flight had been cancelled. Our family members back home had already left for the airport waiting for our arrival, and we then had to tell them to turn around and go back home. We were forced to book another hotel room for the night and had to wake up extremely early on July 12th to make it back to the airport. We were not given any food vouchers, hotel vouchers or any other accommodations that airlines regularly make for people going through these issues. I had to miss work the following day, July 12th due to all of the travel changes and delays. This travel experience inconvenienced my whole trip and made me realize that I'll never use Frontier again."

This delay was known prior to the initial departing time. However, it wasn’t until 2.5+ hours after the initial departure that the line decided to cancel the flight due to employee fatigue. I understand the extra workload is a lot for them. However, prior to departure time it was known the flight was delayed 5+ hours. If they knew the extended hours meant the employees couldn’t work, why didn’t they let is know earlier? My family could have booked another flight during that time. My family could have been home!

Long story short on that, we sat on the plane for 2 hours, only to run low on fuel, be deplaned and have our flight cancelled. Why? Not because of the weather that had finally cleared, but because the crew had “been on the clock too long”. Not one comp was offered for the trouble. I came to MCO at 11 am. Left at 8.30 pm. I am a Type 1 diabetic who mentioned low blood sugar. Nothing was offered. Not a soda. Not even water. I feel like the discount price comes in the form of you being willing to accept the treatment of cattle, not the treatment that human beings deserve. No compassion. Just indifference. I am rescheduled to leave Sunday. We’ll see how that goes. Next time though? Going back to Delta. Would rather pay more and actually get there."

Firstly, my first leg flight was delayed almost 3 hours, and we weren’t offered so much as a free soda as compensation for the inconvenience. In fact, I was told that there was a charge for everything except water. The staff was indifferent and the landing the roughest I have ever experienced. Then, they changed the gate for my connecting flight at the last minute without any notification whatsoever, causing me to almost miss my connection. Then, that flight was also delayed because they decided to kick off an elderly man for being “unaccompanied,” and then threatened to kick off all the passengers who spoke out against this cruel and unnecessary act. I am not the kind of person to get salty about little things, and this is the first negative review I have written about anything, ever, but I have had such an exceptionally bad experience I feel the need to speak out. Please, pay the extra 50 to 100 bucks and fly with a halfway competent airline. I know I will."

I was told 2 hours before the flight was supposed to take off while I was checking in my bags that the flight was cancelled. The reasoning: because there was no pilot. That made absolutely no sense to me. There was a national convention and about 75+ other sisters from my sorority were just as confused as I was. Instead of trying to find another flight ASAP, our only options were to fly out the next day, get a refund, or find another airline. Other airlines charged anywhere between 500-1000 dollars to book the day of. Frontier wouldn’t reimburse until days later. The worst of it all? They only gave a $100 voucher. Who can travel with $100?! Long story short, Frontier is very unprofessional and I don’t see myself giving them a dime ever again."

I called today to find out what was going on, and they told me I needed to file a 3rd report in order for them to track the bag. From what I've seen, no one at this company is aware of their processes and they are not willing to answer my questions regarding compensation for my bag or divulge any meaningful information. The worst part is I was foolish enough to sign up for the ""Discount Den"", and, according to the ""customer feedback representative"" I will be unable to recoup that money. So I will be able to get discounts on flights for the next year from an airline I will never use again. Great.

We boarded and were told that due to some minor storms in Allentown many flights were being rerouted and so the tarmac was backed up. We were number 27 in line for take off. Everyone waited patiently and approx 2 hours later we were told we were getting ready for flight. A few minutes later the pilot got on and told us that we needed to head back to the gate because if we flew at that time, he would be over the 9 hour limit of time they’re allowed per day. I would assume they could figure this out when we were number 27 in line. We were told that hopefully they could get new pilots and we were given $15 vouchers for food (but at this point it was 8.30 and the restaurants in the airport closed at 8.30). We waited and reboarded at 10.45, hungry. Many people had left to other flights. Once boarded we were told by the pilot that this particular plane flies on computers and the computer was down. (Makes a passenger a little uneasy.) So it would take 5 minutes to reboot. At this point people got very anxious and they tried to reboot a second time and a third. I went up and asked that the staff explain the situation as people were getting very scared and another woman asked if we would be refunded if we left. Most Staff said they could not guarantee refund but one staff stepped up and took those that wanted to get off out and did fully refund the flights. Even the one staff member said she didn’t blame us for being concerned. It wasn’t explained very well. The flight eventually did leave at 3 am (I believe) and did make it. But those people sat for numerous hours on the plane and in my opinion a pretty nerve wracking situation as far as safety (from passenger perspective). We ended up altering our vacation by 3 days and booking on another airline at 3 times the price due to last min tix. For 6 ppl, it was a huge expense and our jobs were affected by date changes. If you have a set schedule choose elsewhere."

You certainly cannot blame the weather. We were offered re-booking on Frontiers next flight out of DFW, on Tuesday. You of course would have to sleep 2 days in the airport because Frontier does not offer any compensation for hotel, rental car, food. Nothing. We were told by the gate agent that you can get a refund in 5-7 business days just go on Frontier website and fill out their forms.

We had to cancel one of our flights ($150 flight) for outside reasons and the representative charged us $119 each ticket to cancel. They, then, added a cherry on top by saying that we did not actually get the money back, it was in a travel credit with their company. So we didn't even get face value for our tickets! They explained that they can transfer our tickets to another flight time - perfect. Or so it sounded. Nope. They charge you $119 to transfer tickets as well! They charge you to the same amount to lose you as a customer by canceling as they do to keep you by transferring - no benefit of transferring. Trash company ran by money hungry awful humans who claim to be the best, cheapest flight option. Never trust these scammers.

They were nice enough to book us a hotel for one night - not two nights. So, we checked in at 5AM and had to check out at 11AM! We had to pay for the extra night, food and transportation to the hotel ourselves!! After all was said and done, I called Frontier about my $500 travel voucher they promised and was told I no longer qualified because the receptionist booked my flight - not me!

Less than two weeks later, I receive notification that they were delaying our flights six hours from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM with no explanation. That got us into MPS at midnight instead of dinner time. So after getting our car from the park and fly, we made it home to Duluth at 4 AM. Thanks a lot! Also, the plane we flew home on had the most uncomfortable, cheap seats we have ever encountered in our time flying.

They made my travel a living nightmare. My honest opinion their too expensive for the quality of service you receive. Pay the money to fly a different airline, it's worth out! From the moment we went to check in, they were yelling at you and if they weren't yelling at you they were ignoring you, rolling their eyes, or making snooty comments. Their flights are never on time. If you're flying with young children I recommend not taking this airline. If you don't purchase where your sitting you'll probably be on the other end of the plane than your child. ""And there's nothing there gonna be able to do about it."" If you have a stroller make sure it's very sturdy and cheap. It will be thrown around and if pieces come off of it, they will just throw it away. And they will enjoy telling you that. Don't bother going to customer service because they're just as useless and disrespectful as the rest of the staff. By the look on their face can care less about what you got to say to them. They will tell you that ""if they find anything they will probably just throw it away"". If you're flying solo or just adults with a carry on it might be worth flying with them. If you can handle the rudeness, disrespect, and not being on time."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Chicago,June 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Nashville to Chicago. Frontier cancelled this flight just as we arrived at the airport, due to some issue on their side. Since they have no partnerships with any other airlines, their offered option was the next Frontier flight, which was 2 days later! Missed 2 days of work and had extra expenses with pet boarding, hotels etc. After spending over an hour on the phone with customer service and escalating to the supervisor, their ""customer service"" compensation for my ""inconvenience"" was a $25 travel voucher. By far, the worst customer service experience I've ever had in my life. will never fly this airline again nor recommend this airline to anyone either. Please do yourself a favor and use an airline that cares for their customers and has a real level of customer service. Would have rated a ""0"" if permissible."

I booked a flight with my family and had no knowledge that it was a requirement to check in early or the previous day for our family to be able to sit together. They didn’t care if my family sat together or not and said we should have just paid extra for us to sit together. It’s not really what they said, but how they treated the situation. It was very apparent that it wasn’t important to them. My Frontier flight to Las Vegas has been a bad experience today, with no one willing to help. When asked if there was something that was able to be done I was told “let me check”, without looking at his computer screen then followed by “there’s nothing I can do to help.” On top of this, the rude representatives talked about customers behind their backs as soon as they walked away, in front of other passengers waiting at the desk. Along with complaining about other team members behind their back. But it wasn’t not being able to sit together that pushed me to write this review it was the blatant lack of care that made me feel it was my duty to warn anyone from dealing with the mess they call an airline team."

Imagine the slimiest, most immoral, dirtiest cheat of a car salesman you can think of. I would like to enter a review of how the actual flight was, but I wouldn't know, because Frontier decided they wanted to cancel my flight 1 hour after it was supposed to depart. This is bad enough, but they then refused to refund the cost of the flight after they said they would. They handed me a paper saying they would reimburse the cost of my next flight up to $400 if I submitted my ticket. I did this, and two weeks later, I received a follow up email stating they would not refund the cost of my flight because it was cancelled by the ATC. I called customer service and they said I was a no show, which is a lie. Frontier doesn't care about the customer. I don't even think they care about money because the way they run their business is idiotic. In summary, I paid $200 to be told by their horrible customer service that I didn't show up to a flight that was cancelled, despite having the baggage tags to prove it. Unfortunately there is no option for negative value for money."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Chicago,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Phoenix to Chicago. My flight was cancelled and I received my notice at all - no email, no SMS. I was continually checking the flight status on the airline site and it was not shown as cancelled. I only found out when I arrived at the terminal. Frontier cancelled the flight for ""weather"" (standard snow) but I knew that other airlines were flying out such as AA, United and Delta. I was offered a flight 6 days later which I could not accept. They offered no other options. Because of my work schedule and monetary reasons, I was forced to buy a ticket on another airline which was six times the cost because it was a last-minute purchase. Their customer care offered no compensation for the huge inconvenience and cost. They even claimed they sent an email about the cancellation. That is not true. I purchased my check-in bag online after the supposed cancellation email and I received an confirmation email for the purchase. I also received an email the day before for early check in. So their claim rings hollow. When I told their customer service about my issue, they responded with a canned message. No empathy, no concern. I will never book with Frontier Airlines again and I recommend the same to anyone reading this. Save yourself the misery."

Had a diversion due to an emergency and had to land at a different airport, no drinks or snacks were offered during the sit on the runway for over an hour. Sent us out at the Dallas airport with very little info. Most passengers were lost and as we tried to get through security again, no one knew about the emergency landing so we were kicked out of lines only to have to go through 2 more times. Offered a $15 voucher for $500 tickets. "

Flight booked for my adult daughter through Priceline on frontier. The first flight boarded but didn’t take off. After an hour my daughter got off the plane. Weather issues (not the airlines fault). The connecting flight also was cancelled. The first flight took off 7 hours later. We already left the airport with a phone number the airline gave us to rebook. Called the number for 4 days. Only got through twice and was hung up on. Today I had Priceline call and connect me with frontier and I was hung up on by frontier again. Called Priceline again and they were going to stay on the call until it was completed except they could not even get through to frontier. Waited a couple hours and called frontier again. I finally got through and the representative repeatedly informed me that we were a no show and the flight had taken off! I told him that I have an email that says the flight was cancelled. He then asked if we were even at the airport and maybe we were a no show. I asked him if he could see the $50 charge for her bag. He said yes. So obviously we were at the airport since we paid for it at the counter. He then told me again that the flight had taken off. Every time I was speaking he would talk over me. 2 other family members had their flights cancelled on the same day but were flying on a different airline. They had no problem rebooking. I was informed that my only option was to receive a travel voucher refund and I could then book a new flight on frontier. No thanks! In the end I received a refund and will book her return flight on any other airline. I will never fly on Frontier. If you have a problem their customer service is horrible.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Orlando,June 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Don't be incited by their low prices. Go ahead and book the more expensive flight! Me and two other colleges flew Frontier from Orlando to St. Louis. A quick two our flight there and back for a two day trip. The trip there, our flight was delayed an hour. This was after the gate was changed twice! The flight staff all seemed incredibly confused. The pilot spoke over the intercom like: ""Welcome uh to Frontier uh Airlines. We're um...flying to St. uh uh Louis. We should um uh get there soon and safe..."" However, all this was forgivable. We received news that our 6:30AM flight back to Orlando was cancelled 30 minutes before it was scheduled to board. Leave us and about 40 other people stranded. After being left standing around for forty-five minutes or so, the airline contacted us about of cancelled flight through text to offer $100 vouchers for an upcoming flight with them to compensate. This did not work because the next flight to our destination or anywhere near our destination wasn't until the next morning. After seeing this I called their customer service line to weigh my options. This is the only redeeming quality of the airline. A person answered immediately and gave me many solutions: the best being to book a flight to our destination through any airline and they'd reimburse us up to $500 per person. Although difficult, we did find a flight the day of within our financial restrictions. Still costing a little over $1400 for the three of us. It was three connecting flights from St. Louis to Houston to Pensacola, to Orlando, departing at 11:30AM and arriving at 11:10PM. Thanks to the unreliable quality of Frontier what was supposed to be a two hour commute stretched into 12 hours. I lost and entire day to correcting their shortcomings and now have to was 7-14 business days for a $1400 check in the mail. I appreciate each customer service representative I spoke to, they did their job immaculately, but the airline's one job of getting people to their destination wasn't accomplished. I cannot express my flat out anger and extreme exhaustion after the incident. Do everything you can to avoid flying with this airline. From my day wasted at multiple airports, I also noticed quite a few delayed Frontier flights for other destinations. And I didn't even mention the just okay quality of the one flight I did have with them! They couldn't get me to book with them again even if it was free. I would rather walk."

My husband was taking me to Vegas for my birthday. We were at the airport 3 hours early. Got checked in went to find out just were we would be boarding and the walked to get food. It was 45 minutes before time to get on the plane. We walked back to the area the lady was on her phone talking to a friend. I know this because I could hear her conversation when I walked up to see if we were still in the right area. Well we got in the boarding line when we got to the check in door the girl taking the ticket said please go to the counter. I said for what, I had read all the bad things about this airlines but hey I try to stay positive we were excited about a getaway. We talked to the so called Supervisor. She said the plane was gone, she said she announced it several times I said but we were right here I even talked to her. She became rude saying well you all are the only ones that did not here me.  Well can we get on another flight no she states well can we get our money back .. no it's not my fault she states. Then threatens to call security. What about our bags they are in the flight that has left. She said what you want me to do? Then she says we usually don't do this but I can try and get you all on a flight on Wednesday. I said but we would we do about rooming until then she said I dont know. Or you can get on a plane Friday. "
Not Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Denver,June 2019,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  My flight from Albuquerque to Denver was cancelled well before departure. The reason stated was weather. There were indeed thunderstorms in the area. I checked on all other flights on other airlines and they were delayed by about an hour but none of them were cancelled. I checked on Flight Stats to see the on time rating of this flight, Flight 630 and was shocked. The overall flight rating was ""Very Poor"" The On Time percentage was only 36%. The Excessive (over 3 hours) rate was 55%, and the ""Very Late"" percentage made up the remainder. This means that Frontier deliberately operates this flight with no intention of getting it's passengers to their destination on time or in my case, at all. I can understand why Frontier is rated the worst in the country, but this seems fraudulent. I cannot believe the FAA allows this bad an airline to operate at all. "

We packed the house, dropped the dog off at doggy camp and headed to the airport at 1030pm with all 4 kids under age 7, 4 carseats, 4 checked bags and 1 grandma to board our 1255am flight. Papa dropped us off and we headed to the Frontier counter to check in. I hand them my id and they tell me did i know our flight was cancelled. No!? They said they sent me an email around 6pm for our flight saying it was cancelled due to weather in Denver. Not delayed., cancelled, and the soonest next flight would be  5 days later! Or they could refund my money in 5-7 business days. I cant believe how horrible i felt looking at my excited kids and the mountain of stuff we had to move with no plan. Frontier refused to accommodate us in any way and as of now i am not even sure the refund has started processing because all 4 times i called customer service it disconnected me. Of course there were no other available flights out last night but some out during various times in the week costing double what we had booked 4 months ago. Needing to get to a funeral, we decided our only option was impromptu road trip. Rental cars cost triple what we had reserved in Denver so we came home, threw everything into our traverse and away we went. After 26 hours of basically driving through the night we made it from Washington state to Denver. I will never fly on Frontier and dont recommend it to anyone who wants to get to where they are going!"

Love this airline, this was my 4th time flying with them and they all have been great! Being over 6’ tall there is plenty of leg room. All my flights have been on time and the flight attendants were all friendly. You have to pay for you food and drink but for the money I saved on the ticket it’s well worth the 2 dollars. My ticket was 156 round trip, well over 200 dollars cheaper then anyone else. Thinking about getting there frontier credit card and will definitely be booking a trip in the future."

Don't fly Frontier, just go ahead book originally through a reputable airline. It may be a little more expensive right now, but it could save you $1000 later. They also charge you for anything other than water (soda, tea, coffee, crackers, etc), their plane smells, they charge you $50 each way for any luggage larger than a computer bag, and if you're 5'5 or taller, you're going to have an absolutely miserable flight due to having zero leg room."

Every time they have had multiple delays, this airline is king on delaying flights. It’s not just a few minutes it’s always more than an hour. They start with 20 min. Delay and keep adding until they frustrate their passengers. It’s not delaying because of any unexpected events or weather conditions, it’s always mismanaging their scheduling."

Service was great. I was in the front row and had ample leg room and reclining space and it was very comfortable. The way back, however, first the flight was delayed an hour due to internal Frontier issues. At this point the flight shouldn't have taken off at all due to weather at the destination predicted for this later time. Instead, we get to the destination to not be able to land due to fog. I literally saw the runway each time they tried to land and then it was a tease and they just went back in the air). After flying in circles for hours (almost 2), they finally decided to divert the landing. It was a mess. Everyone was standing on the moving plane fighting each other and Frontier did nothing to settle it. We were all also dizzy from all of the circles. After landing in the diverted location (3 hours away from the intended location) we were told we could not take off again until the next day and no hotels would be provided. I am currently waiting for this flight and it has already been delayed from the intended time. The forecast in the destination still says severe fog, Frontier just wanted to make the flight early enough where they can almost kind of prevent giving us somewhere to sleep all night. Let’s see how much longer this flight gets delayed, definitely not happy with my experience with Frontier and will not be flying with them again."

From the headache of checking in forcing me to pay to pick my seat after an hour of checking in online. You lose my bag on a direct flight from Denver to Pittsburgh. They had us in our line for our flight and me and one other girl didn’t get our bag every one that checked in before and after did. Then the lady in Pittsburgh try’s to tell me she worked for you for years and you won’t pay to have it come on another flight. I will get it Thursday at best. So now i has to by dress shoes for work since my tennis shoes and dress shoes where in my bag so i can go to work. Then the lady questioned whether or not we were checked in an hour before like i was to blame. Which is a bunch of bs. Because everyone else in that line got there bags. This is your fault yet i felt like i was to blame. You should be doing everything in your power to make this right yet your too cheap to get me my bag. Poor experience all the way through with this airline. Nickel and dime people to death for terrible customer service.

Plus, those cheap flights are never as cheap as they advertise. You have to pay for your seat, cary on, check bag, food and beverages  nothing is free. I got to the terminal & no one was at the front desk. Everyone knows how frustrating it is to feel like you’re going to miss a flight. Well imagine having enough time but no one is there to check your bag, which I paid $32 for. I bought a flight with Spirit because I knew I would never make it to my flight. When I get to the other terminal I see that my Frontier flight got delayed. I still could’ve made my 1st flight if a worker had just told us what was going on. But they left a line of like 10 people worried sick for who knows how long because I left.  The difference with my second flight is that Spirit kindly canceled my flight for me & even fetched my checked bag from the room in the back & now I have a flight credit with Spirit. I tried to get a refund from Frontier & they didn’t even give me a reason why. They just said no  because I missed my flight."

My girlfriend and I were seeking to sit next to each other on our flight this morning. Naturally, and understandably, we each had to select a seat and pay to do so. What wasn’t natural or understandable was why, for the exact seats, she was billed a higher price. We tried this on multiple days and seats. See the attached photos. I don’t know if it was because she was female, or had been on the website before, or fit whatever weird algorithm Frontier uses to upcharge people. But it was clearly not right. So I called customer service. Not the poor representative’s fault by any means, but her utter lack of English comprehension was not helpful, and it took 20min of her jumbling up words before I requested to speak with a manager. When I spoke with the manager, he told me that his system had it much more expensive, so we were getting a good deal regardless. Which was incredibly dismissive. As I saw it was getting us nowhere and this was something beyond his pay grade, I asked to be transferred to the survey so I could express these concerns. Instead, he hung up on us. I fly Frontier a lot for their cheap flights, but with multiple delays over my last few flights (which is usually not even announced until the last minute), poor customer service, no complimentary cups of water on board (odd way to save a buck), and more, I’ll be spending the same money for Spirit and/or other airlines."

I was supposed to land in my home town before 8am. They delayed for two hours and then finally let us board. We got halfway there when they turned us around and took us back to the departure airport because of maintenance issues. They got us off the plane and switched planes, making out new departure date 1:10 pm (original was 6:50 am). After waiting almost 2 hours again, they cancelled the flight because the pilot “opted out”. I had to cancel work shifts to be able to fly home and made plans and ended up losing an entire day (only had 4 days off) of being home (haven’t been home in months and it was my cousins birthday and hadn’t seen anyone in almost half a year) because of this airline.

Flight 475 from Jacksonville to Denver. She tried to check in on their website but had problems with the check in after trying multiple times. She then called Frontier to check in via telephone. They were very unhelpful and sarcastic on the phone. They quoted her a price for the carry on bag and the seat selection that was higher than the quoted price on the website. She then asked for a supervisor since the first representative did not appear to understand that she was trying to check in with him as she could not do it through their website and continued to refer her to the website. The supervisor, James #1075189 was rude and dismissive of the problem and became more snarky as the conversation went on. My daughter became so upset that she wanted to cancel her flight because she was then afraid to fly with an airline who could not even handle a simple check in. Price to cancel the flight was $119. I suggest that you address this complaint with the airline as you represent them as a third party. We will never fly this airline again and will take any opportunity to make sure that everyone we know is aware of their poor service. I have also filed a complaint with the airline itself."

We (me and 3 other friends) missed our flight because the staff at the gate did not do their job. They claimed they announced last call, but that seems hard to do when literally no one was at the gate to announce it 20 minutes prior to boarding. They would not work with us on rescheduling a flight and they were going to charge us an extra $120 per person to get on a flight for the next night (which would put us two days behind for our trip). The customer service was the worst I've ever experienced and I'd honestly rather lose out on my $400 trip there and book with someone else, which we did. Thank you to American Airlines for saving the day from the monstrosity that is Frontier. ALSO, not to mention that a frequent Frontier customer (who had a frontier miles credit card) stated that he's never been on a flight with so much miscommunication and rude employees. "

When we reached the self-check in machines none of them worked. So we had to go to the counter and check in which is fine but once we left the counter and got to the security checkpoint we realized all 3 of our tickets said “0” for the seat number. So then when we finally got to the gate and asked the frontier folks there about it they tried to get us seats but now we would not be sitting together. We complained and luckily they were able to ask another passenger if they would be willing to move so that we could sit together and they agreed. Once we boarded the plane we ended up sitting on the tarmac for 2.5 hours because frontier screwed up the maintenance log for the plane so we couldn’t take off until it was fixed. During the 2.5 hours Frontier didn’t as much as offer anyone water, even after I told one of the staff that they should probably at least do that. To wrap up the trip we went to check in for our flight back home and realized that the person from Frontier that we scheduled the flight with over the phone didn’t know the difference between May and June and scheduled our flight back for June 28th instead of May 28th! Because of this we incurred a lot of additional expenses to stay an extra day in addition to missing an additional day of work. We will not be flying Frontier again."

We didn’t leave until 3:30pm. We only got a $10 food voucher to replace the time we lost on our first day of vacation ( it was an insult). To make matters worse the staff was rude and inconsiderate! We will never fly frontier Airlines again. Save your money! The headache isn’t worth it!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Little Rock via Denver,May 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  San Francisco to Little Rock via Denver. Absolutely appalled with the customer service of this airline. Got the airport early enough to nap before our flight (very long day and had a 12:30am red eye flight) so when we get there we hear an announcement for the flight before ours that they were canceling due to ""weather"" which was never elaborated on and later overheard a conversation between the customer service agent at the gate and someone on the phone saying it was delayed because the plane was not serviced in time for flight. Not long after we were told our flight to Denver would be delayed. I had a funny feeling we would end up like the flight before us and prepared myself for the worst. Sure enough they came over the speaker again saying we would miss our connecting flight in Denver to Little Rock so we were offered either a refund or another flight through them. They were very rude in informing use they would not provide a hotel room for the night. They said we would have a ""50/50 chance"" of making our connection in Denver but if we took the chance and it didn't work they would not provide a hotel or a refund because they couldn't give us a 100% answer if we would be able to make our next flight. They were very unprofessional and did not speak to people in a polite tone or manner. There was one agent there for 65 people, up until the end of the line where another agent showed up and treated us with such disrespect. Some people hadn't even been helped when they made the final call for boarding on our original flight to Denver that they were then forced to take because their bags were with the plane and there was no attempt made to get them. Simply because they hadn't gotten a chance to speak to a representative before time ran out.  I'm so unhappy and it is not worth saving the money. "

They docked us an extra $75 per bag for an extra 4 pounds. If I’d known that at the hotel I would’ve just bought another bag or brought an empty and checked it because that would’ve been cheaper. So don’t plan on buying an souvenirs. Cause you will be charged additionally for the extra weight. Completely not satisfied seeing I made sure it all fit in the case I brought! This is outrageous an extremely high price. I would like a refund for the inconvenience cause I will be looking for a different airline in the future. I’ve never been charged extra off any other airline!! And will be sharing this review on Facebook and and everyone.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Chicago,May 2019,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Syracuse to Chicago. Frontier is a clown operation. Flight was supposed to be from Syracuse to Chicago O’Hare. Things started to go wrong when gate agent announced that the flight to Orlando was delayed (yes, she thought ORD meant Orlando). No ETA was given and board at gate still said “on time” until after about two hours they announced the flight was canceled. Oops, I mean “delayed” (from Thursday to Sunday). Gate agents lied and claimed they would process refunds, but then got tired of dealing with angry pax and referred us to 800 number. Entire Frontier staff at SYR was ill informed and unfriendly. Getting refund (hopefully) meant an hour on the phone mostly on hold and otherwise dealing with barely comprehensible foreign call center worker. Also booked now useless Chicago hotel reservations through Frontier’s website. My attempts to get this refunded meant another ultimately futile two hours on the phone with more foreign reps and of course got nowhere, so now disputing it with credit card. I also note that gate agents said cancellation was due to mechanical problems but customer service rep on phone claimed it was weather. No straight answers from this airline. Obviously never got to Chicago and just drove back home."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Detroit via Denver,May 2019,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1,  Customer service was horrible. Gate agents did not seem to know the company policies. I was told that I had to pay for a carry on bag or I couldn't board my flight. Was instructed by 2 gate agents to take what I could carry on board and to place my bag next to trash can. which was tossed in trash can after I boarded plane. I had a 10 hour lay over in Denver and no change of clothing. I really thought they would put my bag in lost and found but it was actually tossed out. I spoke to Frontier about this and was offered a 200.00 voucher to fly in the future. This is still hard to believe I will never fly this airline again! By TSA guide lines I was not suppose to leave an unattended bag but was told by the Frontier gate agents that it was ok.

We had already paid for carry on, then at the airport at the gate as we were boarding, a Frontier employee started pulling people off the line telling us we had to pay for extra baggage! Extra baggage? Ok souvenir bag with gifts. So, why would they have concession stands and tax free shops in the airline gate area, just to then want to charge you $120 for additional baggage? First and last time flyer. Overall rating is a (2), just because the pilot got us safely on ground."

I bought a package from Priceline I flew Delta on the way down and had never flown Frontier on the way home. I was charged for a checked bag 50 and 55 for my carryon. I should have paid the extra money and flew another airline they charge for everything including water. The flight was 1 hour late leaving Birmingham no explanation. Once in Denver our plane sat on the runway for an additional hour. Captain announced it was due to mechanical difficulties from the plane at the gate. Frontier stated it was weather and offered no assistance. Booked me on a flight 2 days later for my return home. I was returning from dealing with a death in our family. My 83 years old uncle and my 82 year old Aunt were on the same flight going to LA and stranded in Denver with medical issues. Frontier again denied any responsibility or gave any assistance.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix,May 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,3.0,2,no,3,"  I wouldn’t recommend this airline, its cheaper but you paid for it one way or another. On May 15, 2019 I had a layover in Denver, I get to the gate A52 it a 30 minutes delay flight was supposed leave at 10:35 pm flight 751. Frontier overbooked the flight ask 5 people to give up their seats for one nite stay in hotel and $400 travel voucher. We boarded onto a hot plane with no air and no pilots to start the plane to turn on the air - that plane felt like 100 degree. People were complaining about the air I will not book with them again. The flight was rough from Denver to Phoenix."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Orlando,May 2019,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10," St Louis to Orlando. Excellent and friendly service both on the ground and in the air. Staff have always been polite and enthusiastic about attending to customers. Out of 10 flights with Frontier, only 2 flights have been delayed by a couple of hours. That means that 80% of the time, flights are on time. And I should definitely point out that the two times that the flights were delayed, I have gotten compensated. I had a 2 hour delay, and I got a $20 voucher. Then, I had a 3 hour delay, and I got a $50 voucher without even complaining to customer service! No other airline does that! The rates are incredibly affordable. Frontier's tickets have made my long distance relationship a lot closer than what it actually is. I just happen to be in one of the nonstop routes, which is why I get such affordable and convenient flights. The Den's Deal is Amazing! I paid $50 to become a member for a year, and within one year I have saved more than $100. This means that the Den's Deal was paid off. The customer service folks are extremely friendly as well. Whenever I call, I don't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be transferred to an agent, and their knowledge and expertise is exceptional. I absolutely love the emails with the promo codes that they send on a weekly basis, and I think their ""kids fly for free"" and ""friends fly for free"" programs are the best thing an airlines can do! The Frontier App for iPhone is extremely well-made, everything we need is in there, and we can even get boarding passes to our Apple Wallet. Also, the fact that the airplane liveries have animals on the tails and winglets is the most adorable thing an airline has ever done. My dad, my mom, and my boyfriend all agree with me that Frontier is an excellent airline. Overall, I am extremely satisfied, and I cannot emphasize how grateful I am with this airline! I wish people would appreciate this airline as much as I do because it definitely has the potential to beat its competitors (for select routes)."

Terrible information on purchasing the flight, did not know I had to pay additional fees for a carry on, had a 20 hour layover and after the layover was asked to pay for carry on again!

The young man, Daniel, in the New Orleans airport at the service counter was very nice, friendly, smiling and was very helpful with our checkin! I wasn’t very pleased with the airline changing my flight several times. But they accommodated us with taking care of our baggage fees. Not pleased that they nickel and dime you for everything and luggage fees are over priced!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Punta Cana,May 2019,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Chicago to Punta Cana. Frontier had officially given me my worst experience as a customer. For starters, my luggage never made it to Punta Cana so they provided me with $75 a day clothing allowance until I get my bag. I had to provide receipts for every purchase. For 3 days shopping I had to provide $120 out of my pocket for taxis which don't provide receipts and $140 in clothes receipts to possibly get refunded. On day 4 of my trip, they found my luggage in Denver and asked if I want it sent to the house or returned home. First of all, I flew international so how did my luggage get sent to Denver and since I spent hours shopping before my vacation, I chose to have them send my clothes. For the second time during my vacation, they lost my luggage again. I gave them the receipts of my clothes and phone charger at the Frontier desk in Punta Cana and they lost them. My baggage just came in today 2 days after my trip. They apologized and offered me a $150 travel voucher for my inconvenience. What a joke. I hope this is enough to deter anyone from using this incompetent airline and getting treated so poorly. I hope they figure out that is not how you treat first time customers and expect return business. I hope this will help in making airline decisions. P.S. I paid over $1000 for 2 round trip tickets to get treated like this. Buyer beware!!!"

They would not book me another flight home, they would not give me my money back, nor would they accommodate me and my Family having to pay for our own hotel! They also threatened to have me arrested because I was asking to many questions! Gave me two minutes to get out of Line and leave their section at the airport! Over $800 wasted on frontier airlines. We had to stay another 3 days at the airport and no food nor vouchers for us to eat! "

The ground crew were very accommodating but the flight was horrendous. After I made my reservations I wound up in a walking boot due to a foot injury. No issues at all, provided wheel chairs and moved my seats to front of the plane upon request. I knew not to expect internet, food, etc. as it was a no frills airline. So no issues there. Flight to Islip went without a hitch, seats not as comfortable as other airlines but also paid half price of other options. Flight back to Florida, now that is where the issues began. At 1:15 am the day of the flight I receive a text that the flight was to be delayed 8 hours. Our 12:55 flight now scheduled for 8:55pm. No explanation, no other options. Fortunately, we have family near airport so dropped off rental car and was picked up. While there I went to Frontier counter to speak to rep to see if anything had changed and what were the chances the flight would be canceled. Of course no answers. Only that the next flight out was on Thursday, it was only Monday. The other options, maybe, would be another flight in the am although not scheduled or a voucher up to 500.00 for another airline. In the meantime, left in the dark. Well the flight that was now scheduled for 9:07 finally departed at 10pm and arrived in Orlando at 1am. The flight crew was a joke, never have I seen such an unprofessional group of flight attendance. They talked the entire flight with another group of flight attendants they were apparently returning to Orlando. We were sitting in row 2, the other flight attendants in row 1. They complained about their day and yadda yadda yadda the entire flight. I was so exhausted I managed to sleep for 2 hours."

You have to have plenty of time for waiting without notice. I flew from DCA to LAX and have one stop at DIA. Both flight was delayed one hour each. That's so terrible. Believe it or not my flight back from LAX to DCA was delayed again! Plus, they don't have complimentary snack or beverage (no water too). The seat is not comfy at all. No WiFi, no screen and no any entertainment. I could say that I will never fly with them again. If you already booked the tickets, I wish you luck."

I've read many bad reviews about this airline, but I cannot say that our experience was negative."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Cleveland,May 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Tampa to Cleveland. I purchased a ticket for my disabled daughter who lives in Florida to see me in Cleveland. She had been hit by a pick up while walking. She is walking with a walker now but only for a couple weeks. She flew alone and the airline was notified that she was disabled and would need assistance, we were told we would be able to assist her at the gate via a gate pass. Drop off went smooth, no resistance allowing Grandma to escort her to the gate. Things went south when I arrived to pick her up. I approached the ticket counter to obtain the gate pass. The plane was due to arrive at 8:35. I arrived at the counter at 8:00 knowing the plane left Florida 45 minutes late. I was met by what I later learned was the counter supervisor. I explained my goal and she immediately started scolding me for arriving at 8 and not earlier. I let her know that I will handle the delay with security and kindly asked for the boarding pass. She looked up my daughter and after noticing she was over 18 she quipped ""I can't tell you if she is or is not on the plane"" after re-explaining my situation she did not care. I stepped away from the counter called the airline help #. They were kind, noted the system and told me to try again, that there should be no problem. By this time the supervisor was gone. The lady now helping me stated she was not looking in the system and that her supervisor had already made a decision. I stepped away and called home office again. They asked me to take the phone to the counter and they would speak to the lady, I did so and the lady refused to talk to the home office by simply ignoring me and asking for the next guest to come forward. In the end I waited another hour (30 minutes after the plane landed) not knowing if my daughter who again could barely walk and had a traumatic brain injury which has altered her mental state would be assisted or would be scared to death because she was alone. She made it to the front with the help of the airport (not airline). Bottom line, I have never seen a more heartless cold and rude performance from a group of people in the service industry. Horrible way to accommodate the disabled and horrible way to treat fellow human beings!"

First of all their baggage fees are ridiculously expensive and you have to pay for carry on bags. Also they changed their flight time without telling us so we arrived to the airport 9 hours early. Then they kept delaying the flight for 5 hours for no reason. Finally we were supposed to board at 11pm and right as the plane arrived they announced that the crew had to rest and the plane would be delayed until 2am. But they should have known that so why didnt they tell us earlier? They gave us 10 dollar food vouchers but every store and restaurant is closed. Because it's such a small airline they did not have any other options for earlier flights and could not give us any other options. Seriously, avoid this airline at all costs. It might look cheap but it is not worth it, plus there are all of those extra fees."
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Los Angeles,May 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  I typically fly quite a bit on business each year (approx 10k + miles per year). This time I traveled with family. Received cheap round trip tickets that turned out to be the same price as comparable airlines due to the hidden charges. They nickel and dime on baggage ($40 per carry on bag per person ‘each way’ and seats about the same $40). So if you have 3 persons wth carry on and want to choose normal seats you will roughly pay extra $480 round trip. Arrived at check 2.5 hours ahead of return departure. Took 50 minutes for Baggage drop off as Frontier had a huge line of about 150 persons wrapping around a wall back to the terminal information desk. Baggage check in desk was antagonistic and argued that any missed flights would be the responsibility of the passenger. Barely made the flight. Loading was disorganized and rushed and passengers were informed they must be boarded 15 minutes before take off. With everyone loaded plane did not even taxi until 45 minutes later due to baggage loading delay. Pilot did not make up time and told us that we were fortunate to have bags loaded on the plane. Seats were extremely uncomfortable and cramped. There is no WiFi offered even at a fee. No inflight entertainment. They offer no courtesy snacks or drinks on 5.5 hour flight ($3.00 for a coke or coffee). Service is not friendly. Baggage claim was also delayed. No shock at that point. I experienced above on both flights to and from Orlando/ONT.

I have never flown Frontier and will never ever again after the experience I encountered with them. I do not recommend flying with Frontier, Yes, they have cheap flights but they also charge you for everything else. $40 bags each way, $15  for your seat each way and they do not offer complimentary drinks or snacks for your flight. Want my opinion? Pay the extra money with Southwest, at least with them you get two free bags, complimentary snacks and drinks and don’t have to pay for your seat. I will pay the extra money next time just to come in contact with polite employees. I was traveling with a small child and still treated poorly. "

Problem is, this is spring break for many and tickets are now through the roof! Booked with United and had to pay double. Then go to Frontier day of flight and long lines because no one is at the check in line, then when they come they nickel and dime you to death with more fees for luggage, carry on etc. Then they switch departure gates, then they were late departing, then when we get to FL it took about 30 minutes for the luggage to even begin to show on the luggage carousel...mind you everybody knows how long it takes to get to the carousel in the first place to have to wait 30 more minutes.

So I finally called management they told me due to that problem they would eliminate $10.00 fee for booking over the phone. And then they tried to charge me almost 50.00 more for the exact same flight I was trying to book on their app! On one of my flights the charges me 38.00 to check a pool cue that their own website stated I could take it as a carry-on. They may advertise low rates, but they dont honor posted prices or honoring things stated on their own website as a free carry on and making me check my custom pool cue, charged me money and when I said I have no way to secure my property and they reassured me by telling me ""people dont steal at airports"". The worst customer service ever and this company may not honor anything they post on their website or mobile app. Buyer beware when booking a flight on this airline"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York-LGA,April 2019,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Miami to New York-LGA. Frontier's lack of professionalism, empathy and overall courtesy has a direct impact on retaining customers. On the date mentioned above there was no representation from Frontier through the numerous delays and ultimate cancellation of the flight. I have never experienced such a degree of miscommunication between an airline and its passengers in a similar situation. When the cancellation was announced, a supervisor on the phone came across aloof, callous and nonchalant about the entire situation. Providing nothing else other than a repetitive statement of ""sorry, we can't do anything"". Frontier's solution to the cancellation was either be stranded for the next 3 days or receive refund. Ultimately spending more money than you can afford to be home for an emergency/family. Disgusting."

Politely asked flight attendant about USB port to charge my phone where I was rudely told, ""you should have used the ones in the airport."" My response, ""Well that's some great customer service"" and was told, ""well you booked the ticket"" by your flight attendant. Flight attendant just reminded me while I'll never book with Frontier again. Then after looking around the flight and happening to make eye contact with this flight attendant was threatened to be kicked off the flight. Completely unprovoked, just looking around. This company charges for every tiny thing and then you are greeted with rude attendants that will threaten you. Never again will I fly Frontier."

First told that my flight (#2880) is 3 hours delayed! After 3 hours waiting flight was cancelled, at 8pm!  No reason was given for the cancellation. Rebooking was offered for a 3 days later flight which I obviously rejected! No refund received until now! Had to stay at hotel that night (at own costs) and flew next day, of course with another airline."

We boarded our plane and once everyone was on we were told that the captain would not be arriving for another two hours and we could deplane it we wanted to. This is not the first incident we have had with this airline! We have used them a few times and have run into delays or mechanical issues every single time no matter where the departure or arrival! Today was the last straw. Don’t know when we will be headed home today.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Washington,April 2019,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Washington. If I could give a zero rating, I'd give Frontier all zeros. My mom booked a flight for my family and when we checked in, we paid $100 to check two bags.  We get to the gate and I get a good look at the boarding passes only to realize they've separated the entire family. We're traveling with a child. I go to the ticketing counter where the agent asks me if I paid for seating. I'm a clueless traveler and I'm like really I have to pay for the seats, too?  We proceeded to board and the flight attendant said she would see if she could help us sit together once the flight boarded but thanks to a series of awesome passengers, I didn't have to deal with the flight crew. They  were full of attitude and fresh out of hospitality."

Called customer service because I couldn’t cancel them on the Frontier app. They told me I couldn’t be refunded on the bags because it had been over 24 hours, 25 hours to be exact after realizing I could not cancel the carry on bags on the Frontier app. I asked if I could redo my ticket order because of the error and they told me I would have to pay $190 per person, I bought 3 tickets from Denver to Des Moines and 3 tickets from Cedar Rapids to Denver. I don’t want to pay cancellation fees and now I am stuck paying $210 for carry on bags that I will not have. At the end, the customer service lady asked if I was satisfied with the phone call. That is a joke right? Never flying Frontier again and I will make sure to tell my friends about my experience."

The seats had garbage and my seat was soaking wet. The seats have no space for your legs. Definitely not worth the money paid for. However the staff was very friendly and welcoming, when I started to peacefully complain. I was told an option was to leave the plane and get out. Great way to respond to a customer."

The good thing (and the most important) was that the flight departed and arrived on time at a resonable price. The negative points are related to service. Check in was slow and somewhat chaotic. Seat comfort and service not good and the general appearance of the aircraft not the best. Looked a bit worn out. But, Frontier delivered. I`ll fly them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Orlando,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,  Norfolk to Orlando. Horrible service.  I called and was told as long as I was at the airport 30 mins prior to arrival I would be ok. I got to airport 40 mins before departure and could not get on my flight because check in issues no one was at Frontier desk and manager waited til flight left to come down and say we could leave out Monday when my trip was over. Horrible customer service and misleading information.
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tulsa via Denver,April 2019,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Don't fly with this company! They cancelled our flight from Denver to Tulsa (due to weather), and did not inform us. No advisory on the website or app, either. When we tried to check in online, we got an error that said we needed to call the airline, but did not say why. We we're on hold so long that we were late, so we decided to call during our 3 hour drive to the airport. After being on hold for over an hour, we were finally told about the cancellation. But she lied and said they had sent an email. She told us to get on our flight to Denver, and they would put us on another flight to Tulsa. Refused to tell us when the next flight would be. The counters at the airport were closed, and didn't open when the sign said they would. When they did open, we were again told to go to Denver, but then told the next flight to Tulsa would be in 4 days! We called again, and they offered a flight to Wichita, but refused to pay for a rental car or bus tickets from Wichita to Tulsa, and we couldn't afford it, and couldn't get ahold of friends or family for help, due to the late hour. Could have done that if the lady had told us on the phone 5 hours earlier. They also wouldn't give us a flight with another airline. And refunds take 5-7 business days. Couldn't afford another airline because of that, and rates were higher due to late hour. Refused to get us a hotel for the night. Refused to get us a shuttle, Uber or taxi. We missed our trip entirely, but still have to pay for all of it, due to lack of notice and lying. And they don't even care. Horrible company; I don't know how they are even in business."

The customer service was absolutely horrendous. I was going to research conference and absolutely every other attendee got to take their posters as a carry-on while I had to pay $90 to take it. I even saw individuals on the same plane with posters. They just made me check mine. The flights were delayed both ways. The crew and staff just could not get it together. In addition, all my colleagues decided to fly Southwest. I decided to fly frontier because I thought it would be cheaper. The southwest flight was $285. Frontier was $183. But that was a huge lie. I ended up paying $340 for my flight with Frontier with all the additional fees. I would have given 0/10 if I could. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Orlando,April 2019,1.0,2.0,,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Ontario to Orlando. Customer service lacks for this airline. I did my research before purchasing my ticket and thought the lack of snack and beverages weren’t an issue for the greatly cheap flight to Rhode Island from California.. Shame on me for assuming nothing would go wrong with the flight. The flight got cancelled right after boarding and no one was given a reason as to why. Get off the plane and I was told another flight to my destination would not be available until 3 days after my original flight. I proceeded to then ask about a hotel being accommodated if I’d have to say so many days and was told only 1 day would be accommodated for me. Ridiculous. You have someone be stuck for 3 days but can’t provide housing or a flight through a different airline or to go a different route. I then had to buy another ticket through Southwest, luckily but also unfortunately because the ticket costed almost 5x the amount I paid for Frontier. I called and asked to be partially reimbursed for the fact that I paid a great difference between the two tickets and was told since I selected to get my original ticket refund I could not be partially reimbursed for the nearly $600 ticket I had to purchase last minute because of Frontier’s screw up. A $120 refund from Frontier is not close to $570 at all. Frontier is absolutely trash."

We sat there for over 6 hours with 2 kids at the airport for them to tell us that the pilot has been flying for too long, so the flight is canceled - at 3:30 am. They knew the entire time. They tell us to go back to the check in to reschedule- only to have 1 person working the check in area. They decided to let us stand there for another hour only to have other flyers tell the entire line that they aren't canceling the flight, they are classifying it as delayed so they don't have to pay insurance. It's 4am, no one has slept, we've all been there since 9pm, and they have the audacity to allow all 200 of us to stand there waiting to see whats going on.  I understand this is a red eye flight but the employees are absolutely unprofessional, they allowed all of us to stand around, most people even missing connecting flights, instead of being straight up with us and telling us to go back home or to the hotel because the flight is being rescheduled.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Orlando,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  New York to Orlando. Should have done my homework! As I sit here on a two hour delay. I took the time to look at their reviews. There is a reason why they only get one star reviews from practically everyone. I travel fairly frequently and have never run across such a delay. I feel like lm on standby while the airline try’s to get a plane. What a joke! As you read this. Learn by research. Check the reviews. Keep away from Frontier Airlines.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Puerto Vallarta via Denver,April 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1," I will never fly this airline again! Do your homework before you book, you will pay extra for everything! They do do not even offer a free non-alcoholic beverage! I had a a flight from Salt Lake City to Puerto Vallarta via Denver. When I went to pay for my luggage ahead of time, I realized that they do not offer any free bags including your carry on! I had to pay for my checked bag and my carry on for each flight. (So from Salt Lake to Denver I was charged and then from Denver to Mexico,) and the same on the way back. (I paid an extra $152 for one checked bag and one carry on bag). The next night when I went to check in 24 hours in advance, I found out that I also had to pay extra to choose a seat. Anywhere from $5 to $45 per flight. I chose a middle of the road seat. When I got on the plane the only seats that reclined at all were the most expensive seats! So unless you paid another $180 per person round trip you did not get a reclining seat. There was no in flight entertainment, there was not even a place to plug in your phone or device! There were plenty of other issues when I was trying to book the flights but I felt that people need to know about these the most. If I could say that I felt like I got a good deal and paid less for the flight than I would have with another airline, this may have been a better expereince but the only reason I went with them was because all of the flights with my usual airline were booked."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago  to Ft Myers,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst customer service ever. I arrived at the airport and was delayed because of an accident on the highway on my way there. However I arrived at the ticket counter at 6:05 to check my bag. The agent was looking up my reservation and then when he found it he said its too late to board we are 20% boarded. I said my boarding pass that I have from checking in says you're not even to start boarding until 6:13. It's not even that time yet. He said I can't take your bag and I said ok I paid for a checked bag but I can bring it as a carry on it's small enough. He said well it will cost you $60 and I said ok whatever I already had my boarding pass and am tsa Pre. Can you give me a $30 credit for the bag I was supposed to have checked.. He said no, call customer service. I said ok where do I pay for this to be a carry on and he said it's too late you should have been here 2 hours prior to plane taking off. I said it says here the doors shut at 6:33 this is a very small airport I can get to that gate in plenty of time and he said no it's to late. What really happened here? Did they sell my seat or where they leaving early? I don't know but the agent was very rude and of course I was already upset. I asked if there were any more flights and he said no not until Monday (this was Friday) I asked about a refund and he said we don't do that. You can call customer service but they won't refund you, you were late. I did call customer service and the person I talked to seemed to have a problem understanding the time lines I was talking about and just kept repeating themselves. No satisfaction there."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Denver,April 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  San Antonio to Denver. Frontier knew that our flight from SAT to Denver will be delayed ahead of time (the same aircraft going to Salt Lake City departed two hours later than scheduled), but never bothered to communicate with passengers via text, email or phone call. Our bags were checked so we had no access to the essentials or medications for 6-7 hours (it should have been a 2 hour flight). When I called the customer service, there is no apology from the airline; the agent just told us it’s important that we showed up at the airport early for announcements because the flight status can change again. It appears that this airline does not care about their customers while also lacks essential infrastructure/resource to manage flight status change, and basic communication. Their agents are also not trained nor prepared well to handle situations like this either."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Chicago to Orlando. Booked and paid for flights and rental car through Frontier’s website. When I reached my destination the rental car carrier would not provide a car because the credit card I had (the only credit card I have and the same one used to pay for the flights and car on the website) is in my husband’s name and he was not on the trip with us. I had to use all of the cash I had with me for the trip to book with a different agency. The carrier that would not provide the car told me to call their main office and they would refund my money for the original rental, but then he found out I had paid through Frontier’s website and said I would have to call them instead since they had my money. I did that and was told repeatedly that they would not give me my $250 back since “car rentals are not refundable.” I understand the situation with the credit card (which was a stressful start to our vacation, but I was understanding about it until I called Frontier’s customer service). Now I’m extremely upset because I’m out $250 and the only explanation the customer service rep or her supervisor could provide was what they were reading off their screens—“car rentals are not refundable.” Next time rather than throw $250 away for absolutely nothing (except to pad Frontier’s profits) I’ll be using it to book with a different airline."

Very expensive fee for carry on bags. Rude people during check in time. Once on the plane, no communication with pilot, snacks and drinks had to be purchased. There was an ill passenger. He tried to get by stewardess, he was told he had to wait. He tried again to say he wasn't feeling well, they made no effect to move. He started to vomit and started to go down, luckily we had a ob/gyn she jumped over the seats and was able to keep him from falling on the floor. She was able to get him to the restroom, but not before vomiting on people. Another nurse offered to help out also. There were no bags in any air sick bags. Do you know how aweful the smell was? There was nothing to use on the vomit that was on seats and floor. Finally using coffee grounds. Then they didn't have any dust pan or broom to clean up. The staff had to use a piece of cardboard and a piece of plastic to scrap it up. My travel partner had asked how much longer was the flight, he received a rude remark. Not once did the pilot come on to let us know we were going to experience rough weather. The seats didn't recline and was like seating on plywood. It was over a three hour flight. We will never fly with Frontier again. And if you are smart you won't either. Horrible experience."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Vegas,April 2019,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Due to Frontier Airlines’ poor sense of planning, the delays and staff, we will not be flying Frontier again. On our first flight from Spokane to Vegas, the flight was delayed 4 hours and we were not notified until we went to check our bags. There was no email, phone call or text that would give us any kind of heads up that our flight was pushed back so late. Then once at the gate, the two ladies at the counter were extremely unclear about everything they were trying to explain to the already irritated passengers and delayed us from boarding for even longer so they could print out $15 food vouchers for everyone on the flight, which mind you, they already had 4 hours to attempt to do. Bag check, food and beverages, and the flight in general was overpriced compared to the experience. On our last day as we left our hotel to head to the airport, luckily we checked and found that our returning flight was also delayed 40 minutes, and once again no notification. My advice to you is please treat yourself and avoid flying Frontier, an absolute waste of your time and money."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Calgary via Edmonton,March 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,"  Tulsa to Calgary via Edmonton. This is my first experience with Frontier and likely my last. Our flight was canceled but we received no prior notice via email or text. When we arrived at the airport in Tulsa and saw on the monitor that our flight was canceled so we approached the counter for information. Instead of being greeted or receiving a quick apology or explanation, we were handed a sheet of paper from the agent. The sheet was dated from the day before (this is how I know that they knew prior that our flight would be canceled) and gave 2 options for how to move forward with the flight being canceled. We were offered via the sheet: 1. A full refund + $500 in future travel vouchers with Frontier. OR 2. $400 credit to find another flight home + $50 in future travel vouchers with Frontier. We needed to get home so we chose option #2. However, I am traveling without a laptop and my cellular service does not have a plan to use in the US (we live in Canada) so I immediately have an issue with the thought of trying to rebook my own flights at a moments notice. Also, I was immediately panicking because $400 is not going to get me home. We were now going to miss our connection in Denver so I would essentially be out 2 flights per traveler. But when I asked if we were going to receive $800 (for 2 flights) per traveler I was told ""Uh, I don't know."" Now I feel very uneasy. I asked the agent to help me look at flights to get us home. She said we would have to do it ourselves. Absolutely no customer service. I explained to her that I had no lap top and no cellular service so she relented and used her computer to look up flight information for me. After 15 minutes she said she could not find a flight and told me that I would have to look on my own. I asked her if there was someone else I could talk to and she said that I could use their phone to call Frontier Customer Service to which she gave the phone number. After 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone with customer service I was rebooked on a flight with United Airlines the next evening that would get me back to Calgary. I inquired about a hotel or food vouchers now because we were now stuck in Tulsa for 32 hours with no lodging or transportation. I was informed that there would be nothing that they could do about that. I ended my call with customer service and waited for my new reservation to show up in my email. When it arrived within a few minutes I opened it only to find that yes, they had booked a flight for me but not for my child! I went back to the counter and asked the agent to verify if this was a single passenger booking (or was I mistaken) and she told me that I would need to go down to the United counter and ask them to check! I am losing my mind now. I asked the agent if she would get us a hotel for the night so that we would not be stuck at the airport for a day and a half. She said she would not be able to. At that time the gentleman who was also working there said that he would help us get a room through the airport when we returned from the United counter. My son and I walked down to the United counter to verify if the booking was for 1 or 2 travelers. As we were standing in line waiting we can still see the Frontier counter and all the lights start turning off. We stand there and watch the 3 employees gather their personal belongings and leave the counter. They walk right by us with no acknowledgement. What about helping us get a room? What about a flight for my son?"

Turned around to be dropped off at the gate again and wait for further instructions. This is not the first time I’ve had problems with this airline. Don’t let the “cheap flights” fool you. What you don’t pay in ticket prices you pay in luggage fees. $35-60 for a carry on both ways. Worst airline I have flown with."

Both flights were delayed in departing by more than 4 hours. The seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The staff on both planes were courteous but non existent except to offer a drink (water is free) and to collect garbage. We landed March 31 during an arctic windstorm. The rolling walkways were visibly trembling and I, an old lady, had trouble reaching the thin handrail as the wind blasted us leaving the door opening. Happily another passenger gave me a hand. The staff just stands as passengers leave, making no offer to help problems of passengers except to order wheelchairs. And try to find your driver in the dark and cold! This is the second (and last) year we walk up and down a winding street freezing after a southern vacation unable to find our ride. Why isn’t there a better system to allow drivers to find their passengers? Oh yes, we paid full fares when we reserved many months ago. And we were not notified of the plane’s problems when we left for the airport in January! In addition, we unexpectedly were made to pay high fees for two carry on small cases. We flew Frontier because it is not too far from our home, convenient we thought. Please take warning. Do not make our mistake."

Additionally, their website will not inform you of the policy before you cancel the flight. Your money will just be gone with no explanation.

I’ve flown quite a lot in my life and my most recent travel experience involved Frontier Airlines, this was the first and last time. I purchased a seat selection in advance and upon arriving to the airport I was told that those seats didn’t exist and that nothing could be done. The gate agent was horrible - like the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I would never call for someone to be fired but in this case it feels warranted. After reaching out to Frontier they basically told me, “too bad” and that nothing could be done about the seats I had paid for or the terrible gate agent. Bottom line: Avoid at all costs. Frontier isn’t that much cheaper after everything is said and done to bother with the headache. I’m required to give them a rating between 1 and 10 but we’re it up to me they would get 0 stars."

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tampa,March 2019,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  If I could give them a 0 that's what they would get. They canceled my daughter's flight and would only put her on a flight for 2 days later, which meant that she would miss her grandmother's funeral. On top of it, they would only book her to a flight in Orlando whereas she is going to Tampa. And that Orlando flight was arriving in the middle of the night, 11:50 something pm. Which means we will have to drive from Tampa to Orlando to get her in the middle of the night. I've been trying to call them, but every time I call within a few minutes, they hang up without anyone picking up. So, now after 12 calls, I finally get a little bit further with the recording, but that's just because I said that I would be willing to pay $25.00 to speak to a live person.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Grand Rapids,March 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Tampa to Grand Rapids. I honestly don’t know how this airline stays in business! This was my first and last experience. I should have checked the reviews before booking but this was a bereavement situation and I wanted to book this last-minute flight quickly and without paying a fortune. At the time the boarding process should have begun, I noticed it said “Denver” at our gate instead of Grand Rapids. I panicked because I hadn’t heard an announcement of a gate change. The monitors nearby now say the flight is delayed 4 hours. I went back to the gate for additional information only to hear an announcement that now the flight is canceled altogether! We were told we had to collect our bags and return to the ticket counter to rebook or to get a refund. Customer service was shabby at best. I will not be using their $100 voucher (that is only good for 90 days). I will not put myself in their hands ever!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,March 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,  Orlando to Denver. Frontier has taken passenger torture to a new level.  I have never been so miserable on a flight since the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. Their seats are so close together it is nearly impossible to bend over and get any thing off the floor. At 5’9” my knees are almost touching the seat in front of me. My husband at 6’3” has his knees jammed in the seat in front. The seats are barely padded there is no real head rest and they do not lean back. It is sheer hell to try to sleep in them. The tray tables are pathetic useless and small. They no longer offer drinks and you pay for baggage. They are not even cheap enough to merit the misery. I will never fly Frontier again.

I love Frontier, I book 10-12 flights a year for myself and family, great fares and convenient times. But yesterday’s 6am flight from Chicago to Tampa made me incredibly ill and nauseous. Some inconsiderate individual had gotten on the aircraft dipped in perfume. Then, to my surprise, that over powering smell was from one of the flight attendants."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Philadelphia,March 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  One of the worst airlines.

My aunt and I tried to buy seats next to each other and were not able to do so, so I bought a seat directly behind her. When getting on the flight the seat next to me and next to her were empty. I asked if we were still boarding and the man rudely answered “no does it look like it” besides being completely rude I asked since we are no longer boarding could me or my aunt move so we could see next together. He yelled at me to sit down and that I could pay him money to sit there. Then stating I should have bought that seat ahead of time making a scene. So rude, there was no need for his rude behavior. If the seat In front of me was more money, why could my aunt move to the seat next to me which was also empty? The one behind her?? Rude and unfriendly staff. Will not be taking this airline again."

The app glitches upon attempting to book a flight. If you book through the phone they charge you extra. Then the app switches your bags to default carry on if it glitches and they won’t switch it to carry on and credit you the money because they’re thieves. Such a joke that you can spend thousands of dollars with them just to get to your destination and they won’t take care of the little things like $40 in baggage fees. Would never recommend anyone fly with Frontier. Not worth keeping a company in business that doesn’t take care of their customers.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Orlando,February 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Buffalo to Orlando. After a preliminary email stating the flight was delayed by 2+ hours, the gate employees were unable to provide any useful updates. The 7pm arrival finally showed up an hour later and passengers disembarked at 8:30pm. First we were told maintenance was delayed for clean up of the recent arrival so we were delayed indefinitely. I’d say they never intended to depart. At 10:30pm we were finally told the flight was canceled and as stated there were two options. Rebook with them or $400 for another airline ticket. Since they have one daily departure from Buffalo, I might leave by next week! That’s if they ever reimburse us for the new airline tickets. Frontier management is obviously thrilled to reek havoc on their clients vacations on a daily basis. Credits with them are useless. Prices are too good to be true. Do Not Book with Frontier unless you don’t really want to travel anywhere beyond the airport."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Ft Myers,February 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Detroit to Ft Myers. I had booked a flight for today on flight 914 which was cancelled due to the weather conditions. I received a text message that my flight was cancelled and the text said to wait for an email with further instructions which I never received. I then called Frontier to see about a rescheduled flight and was given 3 options: the first was to fly out of Cleveland at 3pm which was impossible considering I live 4 hours away and it had been 1:00 by this time, the second was a 9:50 flight for tomorrow which was booked? So not sure how that was even an option.... and finally a new flight for March 3, which is a week from my original date. Obviously these options are ridiculous and none of them were even remotely reasonable or accommodating. Therefore, I decided to get a refund which inconveniently will not be available for another week. I personally have never had such an awful customer service experience in my life with any airline in all the years of travel. I’m not sure how the 50 other customers on that cancelled flight got to where they are going. I feel that the goal of any business/corporation is to try their best to fully accommodate their customers and frontier airlines does not do that. I understand that weather conditions cancel and delay flights but to just throw your hands up and leave travelers fending for themselves is absolutely absurd. I will never book another flight with Frontier airlines again and will be telling as many people as possible to stay away from this company. I suggest looking into finding a solution to better accommodate your customers."

They delayed our first flight so much so that we missed our connecting flight, then they refused to give us a refund on the flight that we missed because of them, after promising that they would wait for us because we had over 10 others that would be on the same connecting flight on our flight. They lied. Very dishonest. Very unethical."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Seattle,January 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My issue is not with the flight, but rather with deceptive practices on book a rental car. I was charged $192.89 for the rental car; however, only $150.40 was credited as a prepay. After a dozen or so calls to the twp companies, I finally got Frontier to admit they had pocketed the difference ($40.49) as a ""third-party fee"". However, this ""fee"" was not disclosed on the website or in the reservation. When confronted with this deceptive practices, the service manager I spoke to just kept repeating that Frontier could only provide information for the flight, not the rental car. There are other airlines out there, e.g., Southwest, that do not impose fees for facilitating car rentals and hotel reservations. Bottom line: don't make car reservations through the Frontier website."

The flight itself was ok, after the delay of one and a half hours because of a mechanical problem. My issue is with the obnoxious, rude drunk women on board. She talked extremely loudly the entire flight. Also, she had several cocktails. She had snuck her own alcohol on board and was never without a drink in her hand. The flight attendants knew about her, knew she was extremely loud, and also knew that she was drinking her own alcohol and chose to ignore the whole situation! I was shocked the the attendants allowed this to happen. I suppose it’s just easier to ignore the whole thing. It was an extremely difficult flight for the rest of the passengers anywhere around where she was sitting. I do hope the flight home is without her! I won’t “be patient “ if it happens again."

They kept delaying it until it was finally cancelled late in the day so we couldn't fly out on another airline. They promised the part was on its way and would be fixed by 7:30 am next morning. Instead of taking care of situation and getting another plane for us, they just delayed us the next day as well, saying the part didn't come. They lied to us over and over again. We only had a four day vacation in Florida from Minnesota, so we were so frustrated. There is definitely a need for better customer service with this airline. Not only did we sit in airport for 2 days and spend money on food and drink, we lost a day of our vacation. When I asked them what they would do for us, they simply said here is $100 voucher to use with Frontier. Like we would ever plan to fly with them again, not."

No problem. But, they absolutely cut bait on us once the flight was cancelled. They offered links for other flights that they’d reimburse for up to $500 total. But all the flights they linked to were sold out or were $1700. They gave us a number to call if we needed further assistance. I called, and was placed on hold 4 times for about 30-40 min each time over the span of 2.5 hours. They were uninterested in helping me find a way home after they cancelled my flight. They simply came out, handed everyone a piece of paper with two useless options and the phone number is sit on hold on and told us we were on our own. It’s that unbelievably poor service that this poor review is for. Don’t blame the employees. It’s their management. Employees are just the ones in front of the firing squad."

I've never experienced a situation as bad as this with any airline in all the years I've been traveling. Our flight was delayed because the pilot did not feel comfortable landing in snow which was apparently coming down in Las Vegas? I verified that at the time it was supposedly snowing, it was actually raining. The gate agent was the rudest woman that many passengers said they'd ever encountered. She told us the flight might not leave, and the soonest flight we could get after today (Sunday) was Wednesday, so we could get a refund right away. Well, as we got to the ticket agent to get the refund, we learned the flight left with our luggage. They didn't care one iota, too bad, too sad. Lies, delays, rudeness, and then the agents started whispering, gossiping and laughing at us to our faces. The worst ever! Don't fly Frontier!"

I was initially put off by all the negative reviews about Frontier, to the contrary! Here's a summary - 1) Check-in staff at Buffalo and Orlando - Polite and efficient! No long waiting times in queues! 2) Flight attendants - Smiling, friendly and helpful! 3) Seats (this was a big one for me, I'm 6'3"" tall) - cosy and comfortable. No idea why there are so many whiners out there! Had a family seated next to us with an infant strapped to his chest, never once did he cry! 4) Take-off from Buffalo (delayed by 35 mins). The captain made it a point to apologize (over the intercom) and informed that he would try to get us to Orlando on time! And he did! Obviously using extra gas in the process but he had a plane full of happy passengers! 5) Take-off from Orlando (on time!). Reached Buffalo 35 mins ahead of scheduled arrival. 6) This is the best so-called ""discount airline"" I've flown in so far. I am from Toronto in Canada. Had I flown from any airport in Ontario, Canada I would end up paying more than double the cost for a direct flight with no stop-overs. For 2 return tickets with 1 carry-on and 1 checked bag - only CAD$495.00. It can't get any better! Thank you, Frontier Airlines!"

I asked someone how to get on and she said she doesn’t work there. At approximately 6:43am I see the plane backing out and a woman with a Frontier shirt on say that the plane was leaving. It was a group of us waiting and no one heard the flight get called. I told her that my items is the plane and she said she couldn’t stop it. At this moment I’m livid. I showed her my boarding pass and showed her either way it was wrong. I did not hear them call. All she could tell me it happens often and she’s sorry. Now I have a flight to Orlando Florida at 10:40pm with my luggage in one city and I’m in another. What really annoyed me is, my keys to my car, House, and job is in there and I cannot drive to get my luggage. This has been the worst flying experience ever.

I think that Frontier is a good value, and they had a non-stop in the winter between San Diego and Milwaukee, which was great. My first problem, though, is that Frontier has seasonal routes, or they discontinue routes altogether. Now that I will be traveling to and from Milwaukee regularly, I tried to book another flight, and there is no more non-stop service between these cities. I joined their Discount Den, because I thought I'd be a repeat flyer on this airline, but that seems to have been a waste. Also, on the return flight, not a huge deal, but they had no coffee creamer!

I was originally supposed to be on the plane for about 5 hours, which includes boarding time, and it turned into 9 hours. This was because of an issue they were unable to control. However, they showed zero customer service or remorse for the delay. Something as simple as a complimentary snack or beverage would have made a huge difference. There was also very poor communication between the crew and the passengers. Every time they said they were in the process of doing something it would take an eternity. They also failed to complete paperwork prior to the flight back to Chicago so that flight was also delayed. No one should ever fly with Frontier Airlines because I certainly never will be again."

Around 8:30 am we received word that the Greenville flight was canceled, but we were not told why. We were told the next earliest flight into Greenville would be Friday - four days later! The best Frontier could offer was a flight to Charlotte, NC the next day! It was not possible to take a connecting flight with another airline, because Frontier doesn't have that kind of relationship with other airlines. Frontier did not even offer meal vouchers for those of us who had to stay overnight in the airport. When another customer expressed concern over not having a place to go for the night and needing to get to her destination, she was offered a number for people who are ""distressed."" The Denver-based Frontier staff was callous and insensitive to inconvenienced travelers. I'll never fly Frontier again."

I have never experience harassment from an airline employee until we fly frontier. When we arrived for our first flight in Orlando, we went up to the customer service desk to check in our daughter stroller, and car seat and carry on. But the rep there told us “oh no you that bag wouldn’t be considered a paid carry on because it was our daughters suitcase. Now on our returning flight back to Orlando. The moment we went through security (literally a 5 minute process because the airport is so small) and sat down at our seat, a lady came up to me without stating her name or credentials, she had a black coat on (no frontier uniform on) and asked me to check in our stroller and asked me did we pay for our carry on (mind you, we arrived at 8:30 and the flight was not departing till 10:51. I immediately thought what is the rush, this airport is super small and we have plenty of time before the flight departs). When I told her we have time for all of that, she started looking at me with an attitude and said it’s best to do it early, please do it now. When I told her, we will take care of it when we are ready, she stormed off, rolled her eyes, and told the reps behind the desk about us. When I got to the gate, they immediately said, “you need to pay for your bag” and the lady with stood right next to her. At this point I looked at her and asked her to please stop harassing me over a $50 carry while I hold my infant. My husband who was behind me started telling the rep what the Orlando Rep said and that if it’s not the same case okay we will pay. Before he could even finish his sentence, the lady immediately interrupted and said we have to pay or we won’t board. We weren’t even attempting to board but rather trying to talk, She literally stood in our, and harassed us. I have never experience such a rude and disrespectful employee in my life. We had every intentions on paying for that bag but what was so frustrating was the fact that she would not let us finish our sentence, assumed we wouldn’t pay, and threaten us by saying she won’t let us board the flight. I should of listen to and sticked to my gut when I saw so many bad review about this airline. There’s a reason, there flights are so cheap! There is no legroom, the cabin feels very tight, no snacks or drinks for free, extra fees on everything, rude employees and delayed flights. Needless to say we will never fly frontier again. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. Better to stay away!"

The next Frontier airline was not for 48 hours, which apparently, was all full. Nor did they assist all passengers with hotel accommodations. I will not fly this airline again, and would recommend anyone thinking about flying Frontier to plan ahead when Frontier cancels your flight and leaves you without assistance. The worst customer service ever."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Albany to Ft Myers ,January 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Albany to Ft Myers . Worst customer service ever. I was 4 mins late to check in during a snow storm on January 19th 2019. Went to the Frontier Desk and tried to check in. No one was there so I asked someone standing at the next counter. He went to get the ticket agent who came out with an attitude. She told me she couldn't print my boarding pass but if I wanted to try to get on without a boarding pass to run upstairs. I asked her to rebook me on thier next flight and she said she couldn't. For the past 3 days I had tried to call frontier to rebook my ticket and was hung up on repeatedly. Today I finally get through and they tell me I am too late and sorry. Well as far as I am concerned they are the worst company to deal with and I bought the flexible extra plan that was of no use. Frontier customer service is the worst and you purposely don't call people back until the deadline is over to rebook.

Fort Myers to Providence . Frontier Airlines was the worst airline ever. I could not add my bags online, even though it said to do so would be cheaper. Literally the toggle was unavailable to do this. Tried at airport and kiosk was charging 45 per bag. That wouldn’t allow me to add either. Next stop the counter where, because I didn’t check bag online or on kiosk, the price rose again. No one cared that I was not allowed to add bags by either prior method. Most expensive flight from FL to RI ever!"

Make sure you read find print because when booking a Frontier flight, customers have to pay extra fee for a seat. And save the hassle even pay for carry on luggage. $45, yikes. Don't bother inquiry about there ""Stretch row seating"" (""extra 5-8 pitch"") lumbar support and diamond stitch supposely available for an ""addditional fee seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on any airline. ” The seats were the smallest they possibly could be, there was no padding in them (like sitting on a board), and it did not recline. I get into the cabin and there is no WiFi, no electrical outlets, no free beverages (other than water), no free snacks not even an movie. Beverages start at $2.99, just incohert.

The TSA queue in Atlanta was 2hr 30 mins long (if you have flown to or through Atlanta you know what I mean) & noway I would have made to that flight. When I arrived at the gate the agent impolitely told me the next flight to San Francisco is 4 days out and couldn't wait for 4 days to catch my next flight. I asked for refund which they refused and they told me even if I had to wait for 4 days for the next flight, I was still going to pay for the new ticket. I have never seen something like this in my entire life. I gladly booked with United Airlines the same day. Frontier is the worst airlines in the World. I thought I would try it just one time, turned to be my worst decision which cost me more money than the delusional discounts they give. Will never fly it again and my family too."

So I will never be flying with Frontier again. I don’t care if their tickets are cheaper but my experience was horrible. It began when I went to the self-service station to print our boarding passes. I had one bag that needed to be checked because it was just slightly too big and when I mean slightly, I’m talking like 1-2 inches. When I selected check baggage it was $45! We then asked one of the guys in a Frontier shirt if they do anything for military personnel, he said to get in line. So we do. We asked the guy behind the computer and he said they check one bag for active duty but do nothing for those that are retired. Mind you my brother served 8 years. So not even a 20% discount or anything? That’s just absolutely absurd. We paid the $45 fee and moved on. Our boarding time was 6:15pm, come 6:20 no one is getting in line and we are told by some fellow travellers that there will be a 45m delay because they need to change a tyre. 7pm comes around, no word over the intercom. 7:23pm hits and finally someone says they are still doing repairs and it will be another 30m. Well, they suck at estimating their repairs because we did not get in line to board until 8:57pm! This causes us to miss our flight from Denver back home to San Francisco and for me to have to call my boss and miss a day of work. We figured they would offer some sort of compensation for having us be delayed so long, even the pilot said normally it doesn’t take that long. As we approach the man who scans our boarding passes, the group in front of us asks and he says he’s not sure, but probably not. (They missed their shuttle that was going to take them somewhere in Denver.) We get into the cabin and we were told there is no WiFi, no electrical outlets, no free beverages (other than water), no free snacks, no movies, no games, no magazines, seats do not recline the trays are no bigger than a small tablet, and more. So we said to hell with it we will pay for food and alcohol because we are hungry and thirsty from waiting so long. The alcohol list was sad. The bourbon they had was disgusting, Breckenridge?, had to choke it down. The snack pack had a beef stick that was oily and gross, the cheddar cheese was this creamy texture similar to cream cheese, but it was salty and slimy, not as good, and half my crackers were broken. I took a bite of everything and gave up. 4 bourbons, 2 sodas and 2 snack packs was $30. You’re welcome. The plane is one of the loudest I have been in, thankful I brought ear plugs. It’s the 21st century Frontier, I can tell you, your guests expect more. Then to top this all off we go to customer service to see what our options were. We are told the next flight to SFO isn’t until 10:55pm tomorrow. They offer a hotel, however, we have to check out at 10am. We asked why they can’t put us in a hotel for two days they literally said, “we’re not gonna put you in a hotel for two days sorry.” We ask for a refund to purchase with a different airline. They said , “it won’t be a full refund.” So you’re telling me you guys fucked up and didn’t follow proper pmcs, so we had to suffer a delay and now further suffer? What kind of company is this?! All in all this was a horrendous experience. I’ll be paying an extra $100-$150 more on my flights to ensure I’m on a better airline next time. First time flyer with them and we won’t be returning customers, nor will any of my friends or family."

This was the worst experience. First I showed up 2 hours before my flight took off and I stood in line for most of the time they were calling people to come up to a different line if they were about to miss their flight and there were many who missed it just while I was there because they only had one person who was working hard to get through the line I only had 5 minutes to get onto my plane after I got out of the line then when I got to my flight I was in the front so it wasn’t to bad but the seats aren’t great and they don’t have a lot of what other airlines have then when I got off the plane to go and get my luggage my bag was unzipped so I lost a shoe my clothes were falling out when I got it and my lotion was missing that I just got. You would think if they went through your things they would zip your bag back up before losing your valuables if I would have lost something that was more important than those few things I would have been livid.

I had to ran down stairs to get their attention but It was on ink that departure time is 11:59 The agent said they won’t refund. We have to book another flight from another airline and its out of our pocket. Frontier airline have only one flight each, while other airlines has many that is available. To me time is money.

Wouldn't answer the phone either. Had to call a customer service number to get somewhere. A very frustrating experience dealing with uncaring people who aren't doing their job. I practically had to beg them to send me my bag to my hotel room when it finally arrived. They wanted to wait until morning instead of sending it immediately. The plane ride was also very uncomfortable and sketchy. Super cheap and nothing is complimentary. Prices weren't that cheap for what I experienced. Should have been free for all of that trouble. I’m currently awaiting a refund for the items I had to purchase while my bag was located. I had a military event to attend and I had to purchase nice clothing along with beauty cosmetics to attend. It has been almost 3 weeks and I have yet to receive a refund check they promised to send to me.

Frontier Airlines has been the worst experience we have ever had with travel. My family chose a direct flight from RDU to DEN via Frontier and received 3 out of 4 of our checked bags. The 4th bag never arrived and after speaking with a representative, we quickly learned that this was nearly expected of this airline. However, this bag happened to contain all of our expensive and necessary ski equipment, so it creates a much bigger issue than a normal lost baggage claim. We have attempted to contact Frontier several dozen times, and succeeded only a handful of times, only to receive the same speech stating that they don’t have a clue where our bag is, but that they are sorry and do not know what we should do about our belongings but they guarantee they won’t reimburse us or help at all. We are now in Denver, paying for lodging, and unable to use the ski lift tickets that we’ve paid for because Frontier will not reimburse us for anything until a week has passed and they will then decide the bag is “missing.” Well, in a week we will be back home and short several thousand dollars because of Frontier’s carelessness and incompetence. Frontier has offered no solutions to their mistake, and has been very clear that they do not care at all. They are knowingly ruining paying customers’ vacations and making no effort to remedy the situation because they are more concerned with making money and cutting their costs. Needless to say, we are never going to fly with Frontier again. In addition, we are making it our mission to warn as many friends and family as we can to avoid this airline at all costs, because it’s become so evident that they will cut corners to cut costs and maximize their profit off of their trusting and innocent customers. A slightly cheaper flight is definitely not worth the costs of replacing your belongings, and especially not worth the risk it may pose."

Each reservation got one hotel room, so you have a family of four adults - two couples - in a room. Everyone on the flight was furious with how it was dealt with. The next morning, the flight was delayed. Again, not a word. Imagine watching your plane be driven away from the terminal. And this is the rescheduled flight.

All customer service reps we talked to were rude, unhelpful, and combative. I can imagine that it is due to the fact that frontier doesn’t care about its customers.

Our trip back home became a disaster upon arrival in VA. We received on 5 of 7 checked bags. We were told bags agents usually lost, we should have it within a day. Whatever. They lost our 6 month old daughters car seat! We were told at least 5 times the “loaner” car seat must be returned when we get our original. The car seat was not up to my standards to have my child riding around in. It was flimsy and awfully cheap. I was so disappointed. Luckily one of our rides home from the airport had an additional car seat in their vehicle. We filed the claim and went home. Roughly 2 days later the car seat appeared at our front door with a tag from Fed Ex. No communication just at the front door. I am grateful to have her car seat back but communication would have been great. Nonetheless we still had a suitcase missing. After 4 weeks going back and forward with Central Baggage in CO via phone and email, I was told my case was being escalated. They asked for a lost baggage claim to be filled out and to add receipts for what was in the bag. I sent in receipts for more than $3800. The email stating it was received stated compensation can take up to 6 weeks. I received an email 3 days later stating they would compensate my family $840, everything received was used on a depreciated scale, have a nice life. How dare they tell me my personal belongings for my family is nothing but a quarter to the value after they lost it! I would love to have our bags back but it seems like they have given up on us."

I think I’ve only every had 1 of their flights leave on time. I expect this. However in the last year I have had not two flights cancelled. The crew at the desk would make the announcements and just disappear with no answers as to why. In this latest cancellation, the flight was delayed 3 hrs and now set to depart at 6:08pm. The other flight lands, deplanes, and we get ready to board. Then they close the gate. It’s been 30 mins and no one has told us anything. We see a Frontier agent and ask them what’s happening. They said they just need the captain to sign off on some paperwork and they can board the plane. Then we start seeing that the flight is saying cancelled online. We ask the agents, they know nothing. When you call frontier, they said our flight was in-flight! Finally they come out and announce that the flight is cancelled but they have no idea how we can get our bags and go about finding another way to get to our destination. We wait at the gate for another hour, while they say their manager is coming with information. A manager never came. They still had no idea. They said the reason the flight couldn’t take off is because they were short 1 crew member. They couldn’t find anyone to staff their flight. Are you serious? We finally get told our baggage will be in baggage claim and wait another 30 mins for it with, as you guessed, no one to give us any information. In the line for the ticket counter they give us a paper that says we can use a website to rebook our flight and that we will be reimbursed with the cost up-to $400. A new flight on American so I can get to my destination cost me $410. I’m now worried based off of other reviews that I may not see that money. Things happen, I get it. However, you should keep your passengers aware of the situation in a timely manner so they can adjust their plans. Your staff should know what is happening and should be able to answer questions. Being held hostage in the airport for 5+ hours with no idea what is happening, how I can get to my destination, and how I can get my bag is ridiculous.  The likelihood that your flight will get cancelled is high and in the end you will shell out more money than the $100 you saved. "

My husband and I first flew frontier in a package we purchased on vegas.com in December of 2017. We had a bad experience with the flight attendants, on the return flight, who were rude and seemed to be talking about and making fun of customers, but we did not do a review. On the first leg of that trip, attendants were great, but I applied for and received the frontier credit card, on board and was told that I would receive 40,000 miles, that would pay for two round trip tickets to anywhere in the continental US. Not true, Fast forward to December 2018, we needed a round trip ticket from Chicago to San Francisco and back, for our trip to Hawaii. I earned several thousand more points throughout the year, but barely had enough points to cover a one-way ticket from San Francisco to O'Hare on the last leg of our trip. We had to go through another airline for one way tickets from O'Hare to San Francisco. On the one way, with Frontier, from San Francisco to O'Hare, on December 22, 2018, had a layover in Vegas for 3 hours, so we had two different flight crews. On both of these flights, we had the worst flight attendants we have ever had on any flights we have ever taken! They were some of the most rude individuals I have ever seen. These attendance had bad attitudes and I heard and observed them making fun of customers who were on the flight. They were complaining amongst each other when they had to wait for a handicapped man who was being pushed in a wheelchair. We sat in the first few rows for both flights and several different times we heard and observed the attendance laughing and making fun of customers on the flight. At one point my husband woke up and observed a female flight attendant looking directly at him, laughing and speaking to two other attendants. She turned away is sharply upon seeing his eyes open and then walked into the galley with the other attendants. Why do they have attitude and display nasty behavior? They are in a customer service related field and should act as such! I took three other flights for this trip, with Hawaiian Airlines and American. All attendants on the other flights where awesome! Frontier needs to retrain or have new training on how to treat customers. Can you please explain to me why we could not put our carry-ons in the empty bins above are row, but was rudely directed to put them in bins four rows back, causing a back up upon getting off the plane?

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Lafayette,December 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Orlando to Lafayette. Lafayette finally has straight through flight to Orlando, and I am so happy! I fly Frontier Airlines  at least once a month and appreciate the low cost, new fleet, and professional employees. I fly out of New Orleans and Lafayette most of the time. Sure, they are not perfect, but I haven’t discovered an airline that is perfect. They have flights that can be delayed, just like other airlines. I think they have done a better job at handling the delayed flights than other airlines I have flown. So far I have not had a canceled flight. On 12/21/2018 I had a flight that could have easily been canceled, but instead Frontier worked hard to get us in the air and to our destination. After boarding (9:45 a.m.) our Pilot let us know that he had been alerted of an EXIT sign missing on the plane and “as ridiculous as he felt this was, the FAA won’t let him fly without it”. He said he they were asking other airlines if they had one, but would have us deplane for our comfort, while they worked to solve this problem. We disembarked and within 30 minutes they had another plane for us to board 2 gates down. It did take a while to get our plane boarded (was in my seat at 11:04 a.m.) because there were no less than 6 wheelchair passengers to board (Christmas families crowd). I am sure they appreciated the care they received to get onboard safely. We arrived in LFT at 1:27 p.m., only 2 hours late on one of the year’s busiest travel days. The Orlando staff kept their cool, under a lot of pressure from disgruntled passengers. They got all the people needing some extra assistance onboard safely - TWICE. They got the rest of us onboard safely - TWICE. They communicated with us often, transferred all the bags, and did a good job getting us loaded in a timely manner. The Crew and Pilot did an excellent job keeping us informed. I did look up the FAA laws and verified the EXIT sign missing would “deem the jet unflyable”. There were many passengers questioning the truth of the Pilots’s announcement, so I wanted to check his truthfulness. We arrived safely a couple hours late. I was very pleased with Frontier for getting us to our destination and not canceling our flight during the holidays!!! I paid $335 for 4 seats round trip during the Holiday period."

After flying frontier 7x with a bag bought for frontier and had no issues in Denver I was pulled out of line and after another 75 passengers boarded was told to go to cust serv to pay a carry on fee - I said it fit under the seat had just came flown in and have used this multiple times before. The girl said she wasn't letting me on the plane and to go to cust serv and she was closing the door in 4 min. So I went and both girls there said my bag looked fine. The station manager Brian came over and said it wouldn't fit and no sizer was available. I said it was. I was then told that if I didn't pay them that they would charge me a 99 rebooking fee on top of my baggage fee and Id miss my plane. I paid it and as I did one girl said that they were getting audited and trying to get their #s up and I was just the unlucky one on this flight. I ran back to my gate and the door had been shut. Luckily security reopened it for me and the girl who had pulled me aside that I had no right to have security open the door and that I should have rebooked and she took my carryon coupon and would not return it. I was in tears by this point. I have never been treated so disrespectfully. I feel like I was targeted as a young female travelling alone. Do not fly frontier through Denver. It is not worth it.

They charge extra for carry-on, water, coffee etc. As well as no WiFi movie music etc. Attendants huddle in back socializing ignoring patrons! All ages had to carry bag up stairs to board plane in tarmac, while attendants watched and ignored your struggle. American Airlines flight in reverses ticket covered the seat, carryon, drinks, snacks, WiFi, movies, and actual service for the same price as Frontiers seat only! Have at least $100 per person extra when taking a Frontier Flight as you will need it to get your boarding pass home etc. It was a horrible experience with Frontier but an amazing one with AA! Both trips were one way non-stop flights and should have cost the same but if you can’t see the small print on Frontier you are out of luck, money and a decent trip."

When it was time to board I scanned my ticket they said I didn’t have a carry on, and I informed them I paid for a checked bag, so they detained me to “confirm”. Once they confirmed me I boarded the plane late and there was nowhere to put my bag. I walked up and down the isles and waited for more people to take their seats. I would have just checked my bag, originally. None of the flight attendants were helpful, and the person that detained me ended up being the guy who took my bag and he didn’t even apologize for detaining me. "

And they are just trying to put both my cancelled flights as one so I don’t get my money back! I have talked on the phone for hours and hours with these people. Finally was told the rest of the check was on its way - it’s been 4 months since then and I still haven’t received the rest of my money.

Then there is terrible and I mean terrible service on the plane, no pretzels, drinks, no internet, and speaking of service, customer service is even worse. I’ve given Frontier Airlines my last dollar, absolutely no more, I’ve given them several chances to prove they can be a decent airline and they’ve proven each time they can’t. I’m telling everyone go with anyone other than Frontier, don’t let the ads for cheap flights fool you, you end up paying more and getting less in the long run. I average flying once a month and I’m just done with getting ripped off and terrible service. I’m actually amazed they’re still in business. "

She tried helping us only to find out we couldn't check in so she put us in the line after all. There must have been close to 60 people in this line with only two people working at the counter. At 6am in the morning we waited in this line until 7:15 am that gave us 45 minutes until our flight left. When we got to the counter they told us we couldn't check in because we were too late. They only had two people working and their computers went down for a short while causing everyone to wait in this line. After putting us on another much later flight to Austin, checking our bag to Austin, and we got to Austin they lost our luggage. We were here in San Antonio for 3 days with no luggage, we kept calling and they never answered our calls never answered our emails, they called us one time to tell us they had no information. This is very poor customer service. We finally received our luggage back in Denver four days after we got back home. We had to go back to the Denver Airport and pick it up finding that it was in Austin the whole time even though we had drove to Austin three times to see if it was there. Frontier is a very poor airline. They need more communication. This ruined our entire trip. We didn't have money to buy new clothes, we didn't have money to even buy some amenities that we needed. They cost us a lot of money and we're not getting reimbursed for any of it and they didn't even really apologized. I will never fly Frontier again.

The flight attendants were probably some of the nastiest people I’ve ever encountered. There were two main flight attendants. The first thing I noticed was one greeting the customers. I was sitting right in front of him, when I noticed he would giggle or make faces at the different people walking by. I didn’t think this was too big of a deal, just a case of immaturity. Then, a single black mom and her child boarded and sat in front of me. This seems to have caught the other FA's attention - she asked the mother how old the child was, and she replied “1, turning 2 tomorrow. Why do you ask?”. The FA said, “she looks a lot bigger than you say she is, but okay” and walks away. From that point on, it seems the FA is constantly picking on the single mother. 5 minutes after the encounter, the FA says “your baby can’t be in a seat, she has to be in your lap if she isn’t officially 2 yet”. The mother complies, but mumbles something under her breath. “Is there an issue?” the FA snaps, staring at the single mother and her child. Another 5 mins has passed, and the FA walks up to the mom again. “Your seat can’t be reclined”, and she reaches over and adjusts it half an inch, without asking of course. Another 5 mins, the FA complains that she can’t see the Mom’s seatbelt, even though she clearly had it on. This consisted almost the entire two hours, the FA constantly calling out the single mother for the smallest reasons. As the FA was in the back talking loudly about all the bloody mary’s She intends to drink for her birthday, the mom fell asleep. As we were fixing to land, the other FA was walking up and down collecting trash, before stopping at the sleeping mom and daughter, pointing and smiling. The FA walks up, “don’t worry, I’ll handle it” and she takes off her gloves. She pokes the mother, “We’re about to land, you might want to hold your baby”, she says, and afterwards, running off to the bathroom to wash her hands. The other FA goes to the back and I can immediately hear them giggling again. I felt so disgusted after the flight, even more disgusted with myself for not saying anything. This was clearly a case of bullying, and the flight attendant was clearly picking on the black mother and her child. It made me sick to my stomach. That was my experience, hopefully anyone flying with Frontier has more decent flight attendants.  "

They claim it was made clear at the time of booking, however, neither of us saw the notice while booking. That piece of information is by far the most important thing to know about that flight and should be flashing in red! I made the booking through kiwi.com so they are who I dealt with on the phone and were extremely unhelpful and said there was nothing they could do. We were looking at mailing our bags to ourselves, and at $300 per bag it was our cheapest option.

I was not able to check into my flight because their app is faulty. Then the front desk agent at the ticketing counter was extremely rude to me and charged me extra for my luggage because I was not able to pay earlier due to their mobile app being faulty. Now I’m at the gate and our flight was supposed to take off at 9AM but is now delayed until 3PM. First the agents said it was because the previous plane didn’t land. Now they’re saying it’s because there is an issue with the plane. There are no other flights they can get us on that leave earlier. Overall, this has been the worst airline experience I’ve had and I intend to discourage everyone I know from ever flying Frontier. They clearly use outdated plane and are too cheap to invest in maintenance so that this doesn’t happen. They also clearly don’t care about customer service - both the front desk agent and agents at the gate have been extremely rude. Update: the plane is sitting at the gate but they are still saying it’s delayed until 3:45pm. The gate agents didn’t even tell us the plane was delayed again - I had to hear it from a fellow passenger. They don’t even have the decency to give us real time updates."

I applied for a refund and was told 6-9 weeks for a refund. Worst customer service I have ever seen. With all the hidden fees you are better off flying with a top tier airline rather than these guys. I will never fly with these folks again. I have had more comfortable rides in C130 and C141 aircraft when I was in the military. If you want bottom of the barrel with absolutely no frills and a hope and chance that you may eventually get to your destination this is your airline.

That’s another $175. What a deceptive airline. Even if you purchase trip insurance, they don’t honor their side of the deal indicating they have nothing to do with insurance. You must call the insurance yourself and they won’t give you a number to call. Frontier gives absolutely no refund in case you need to make changes or cancel. In addition, it is extremely difficult to navigate their on line options and the cost of speaking to customer service is $25. What a rip off."

I called to explain my situation to a customer service representative at Frontier and they assured me I would receive a refund and be able to take my round-trip flight back. On the day I was to fly home the agent at the Frontier ticket counter told me I did not have a flight booked and would have to purchase another ticket.  Now it is four months later and I have not received any refund at all. Just called their customer service department again and the representative transferred me to their manager because of my problem. This transfer was to another agent who then told me I had no case. This airline is dishonest and not customer focused. It's employees know the policy transfers the problem along until the customer gives up."

We drove up there 30 minutes later and found the staff left early and the representative lied when she said she'd leave our luggage with the airport/security.

We checked our bags and got through security in a reasonable time frame (because it wasn’t Frontier controlling it). We arrived to our Gate number (Gate: 17, after being switched from Gate 23) and after waiting for about 20 minutes we received an announcement that our flight would be delayed for 2 hours, so we thought “okay, at least it wasn’t cancelled and we will still get to Denver at a reasonable time.  Within not even 15 minutes of receiving the announcement, we received another announcement that our flight was cancelled at 7:58 - almost 30 minutes after we were originally scheduled to depart. If Frontier cared enough and used this little thing called “effort” (I know it’s unheard of) then they could’ve arranged for another plane to get us to our destination over the Thanksgiving Holiday, but God Forbid that ever happening! Because of this, we lost a dayof our vacation out of our already short vacation (4 days). Because OF Frontier Airlines we had to get our bag rechecked for our new flight which costs us another $30 which we had already paid to Frontier for our cancelled flight! On top of that, we had to get our hotels ans rental car rescheduled.

There was no indication of when the flight would depart. The sign at the gate simply said it was delayed. Fortunately I Have a flight tracker app and was able to follow its status. I received an email before arriving at the airport about the flight delay so I was able to kill time before going to the airport. The only suggestion I have is that flight delays be updated more regularly on the app. Based on my experience I would use the airline again. Great value."

I booked a round trip flight with Frontier Airlines months previously and the morning of, I was texted that the flight was going to have a significant delay which would cause me to miss my layover flight in Denver. I tried calling customer service right away but of course it takes at least 10 minutes to speak to an actual person and when I did get ahold of a person she was very unhelpful telling me to fly to Denver and they would connect me with the next flight (2 days after mind you). So I proceeded to head to the airport for actual answers. I was told they couldn’t fly me to my destination for 3 days after I was supposed to leave! Pointless! I immediately asked for a refund and I was told I would be getting it. Of course I didn’t get it so I had to call customer service number twice more to actually get the refund. And I had to book a last minute very expensive flight out of Chicago. I will never be flying Frontier  again! Horrible airline and horrible customer service."

Zero customer service, even after a month of back and forth with customer service I have gotten nowhere. They left me stranded in 2 airports, making a 2hr flight into a 3 day ordeal, then they overcharged me on in flight purchases and refused to correct the charges. They feel that even though it doesn't even come close to the expenses incurred even for the original ticket, they feel that a $100. voucher for future travel on their airline is more than enough compensation!  Why on earth would I want to go through that again, or even risk it knowing that if something were to happen, they don't care enough about their costumers to even try. Don't risk it, the cheap price isn't worth it."

Although the crew was very nice this is a terrible, low quality airline. The seats are absolutely horrible to sit in with no ability to recline. They are extremely uncomfortable which caused me severe back pain for the entire flight. There is also very little leg room, tiny tray tables, and they also charge for every snack and beverage except for tap water. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this pitiful, low budget, bottom of the barrel airline. I have no idea how they are staying in business but I will never use them again."

Wow, that's all I can say about the super extravagant extortion forced to add a carry on or checked bag. ""Extras"" that are forced onto you if you ever plan to travel with a carry on or checked bag. Almost everybody has at least one or the other with every flight. To add just one bag to your ticket incase you forgot to add or who ever bought your ticket did not know the severity in fees and fines for not doing it at the time of purchase. To add 1 checked bag is $38 + 38.50 carrier chargeable + 4.50 except + air tax 4.00+ fee+ fee+. It was $82.50 for 1small bag that might make carry on size but that charge is super overcharged as well. $82.50! For a ticket that was $42.50, it would have been cheaper to just book 2seats. How in any way does it cost more to stow a bag than fly? How can an airline force such charges? This is an outrageous fee for forgetting or adding a bag. Heaven help me, I just did not know the extremely overpriced extortion fees for just taking 1 small bag. This company should feel ashamed for such extortionate practice! Outrageous!"

To make it worst I checked their website before leaving my house for the airport and the flight was said to be on schedule, (not true it had already been cancelled) . Went through counter and TSA , waited at the gate before knowing flight was cancelled. They had no interest in helping or accommodating me, though I explained I live 2 hours from Orlando and didn't have a way home, by now it's almost 10 pm, was told the next available flight that can accommodate me will be in 2 days. They refused to give hotel voucher or book me on another airline - was in the airport but could not get any help from Frontier Staff. Called 800 number and was told to provide receipts for hotel and new flight and they will reimburse. That happened 10/15/2018 - today is 11/10/2018 after countless emails and documents still no refund. Someone said they wound reimburse but no money still."

The airline then changed in structure and ultimately stopped servicing my home city of Spokane, WA. I was pleased to hear they had re-started service this year and so I could finally again use all my miles I accumulated. I reached out after finding they had wiped my account of all miles. Generally speaking, I understand they expire at times, but in this case the airline itself prevented me from using them as a result of their stop in service to my market. I reached out on 3 separate occasions to get some credits, even partial and all were met with a non empathetic tough luck. This airline will never get my business or anyone on my staff's again. Losing thousands and thousands of dollars to save 2 free flights which were earned by someone who had reached one of their former elite tiers in flying. Just unintelligent business."

The prices are great until you realize how much they charge for baggage and they lie and tell you that it is less expensive if you pay online. That is if their system let's you, if not it costs you an extra $20. Think about this if they deliberately keep 100 people a day from paying online and collect an extra $20 from each person that is $730,000 a year. Tell me they are not doing this on purpose, oh and no refunds on baggage by the way."

We were previously on another airplane ready to take off for Denver when they told us the plane couldn’t fly for maintenance issues. All of the passengers departed the airplane and went on to wait about an hour in the terminal. After waiting and seeing that all the other Frontier flights were delayed or cancelled for mechanical reasons, we were told we would be going to another plane. I’m currently on the plane and have waited over 5+ hours and have been told that there were maintenance issues and also that we needed a new staff. They advised us every 15 minutes that we would be taking off soon, and there is currently no sign of any departure. Horrible, pathetic airline. Pay a few extra bucks and fly with a decent airline."

Fine I get it. Board the plane.  It starts moving, they announce they “apologize” but they can no longer fly us to LGA because of a “curfew” that can’t be flown in past 11. They rush us onto the plane and then we all have to get off. Is this an actual joke. Flight isn’t rescheduled until 11:30 the next morning. So everyone lines up to make arrangements. Computer is down so everyone has to shuffle through the airport where we are lead to the ticket station with ONE representative for a full flight of people looking for hotel vouchers. I understand you get what you pay for but how bad can it get."

I managed to get away with flying on this airline without them getting me for any ridiculous fees, but I wanted to leave a review noting what I've observed. This airline is out to nickel and dime you for everything, even to the point where they'll lie or manipulate the situation. Flying out of Orlando they admitted they don't know who paid and didn't paid for carry on baggage and mentioned they would only check if they ran out of room on the plane in the overhead bins. Then they proceeded to shut half full overhead bins, thus creating a situation where there might not be room for all overhead baggage since they specifically told passengers they may not reopen the bins. Also, no one offered to help when I struggled to get my carry on (paid for) into the bin. It's under the weight limit, I'm just a string bean. The plane itself was also dirty. The one I'm sitting on right now is on par with the NYC subway. They need to vacuum these planes once in awhile. It's pretty gross. There's crushed M&Ms in the seat and what looks like crusty bread remains and candy wrappers laying around. On my flight from New York they were also delayed by 45 minutes because they hadn't received their departure logistics from their Minnesota office, the pilot noted that normally the New York office handles the New York flights but didn't on this particular delay. Overall, if you're on a shoestring budget you can make it work, but bring Lysol wipes and be prepared to know their rules to the T, get your bag in an overhead bin asap, and not play any games with your luggage."

I honestly felt like it was a comedy of errors and every single employee looked at you like they were marginally compensated. My flight was delayed 5 hours which in itself is not so bad, it happens. No one knew where the new gate was and other passengers were leaving saying the flight was canceled. I called the airline to verify and it took the customer service agent 20 minutes just to pull up my reservation and confirm that I was leaving at 5:30 although it was already 7:30 p.m.! I felt like I was in a Saturday Night Live skit. traveling frequently I knew that the flight could have been cancelled without it being posted so I waited and sure enough, finally they posted where the new date was. when I arrived there, approached the gate agent and told them what we've been through -  they looked at me like deer in the headlights. I was very kind, they just looked at me like I was lost. I literally said hello can you confirm that this is the gate? They just kind of nodded it was really really weird and I will never fly that airline again."

They loaded all of us onto the plane, we sat on the runway without air conditioning for almost two hours before they unboarded us. Then we sat in the terminal for another 3hrs before our flight was canceled. It was 2am and they told us all to go downstairs for a hotel voucher, so we went downstairs and stood in line for an hour only to be handed a slip of paper that said “thanks for your feedback” with a customer service number. We slept in the airport. No apologies, no communication. Worst airline ever."

I thought I was getting to my gate early, and by early I mean 20 minutes before the scheduled boarding, and I started running cause they were calling the last boarding call for our flight. Then I got on the flight (thank god I was on time cause they left people who weren’t). Then when I asked I got up to go to the bathroom (because I didn’t have time because they impromptu decided to take off 30 min early), they told me I couldn’t -  and then when I asked if they could fill up my water bottle because I didn’t have time to because apparently it doesn’t matter when the flight is scheduled to leave, they told me that I could pay $3 for it. I miss the days of warm cookies and friendly smiles, that cost pretty much the same as they do now. All of their customer service cut backs are not worth the price, I’d prefer to get treated like a human being. Couldn’t afford to give me any water,  even though the plane was 50% empty and paid to upgrade my seat, pay for a carry on and payed for a glass of wine. I was trying to be a perfectly civil human being but they defiantly do not reciprocate. Prepaid to be taken advantage of."

Horrendous customer service and they charge for every little thing. Our flight was cancelled with no explanation and no attempt to get us on another flight. There was no option to reschedule online or in any other way besides talking to customer service. When we called, customer service was closed even though this was just a few hours before our flight. Once they finally opened, we had to spend an hour on hold trying to get ahold of anyone to tell us why our flight was cancelled and tell us how to reschedule. Then we had to pay out of pocket for another flight on another airline because Frontier didn't have another option. Frontier assured us that we would be reimbursed for this flight, but we are not only still waiting on this check after a month, but we have called four times, having to speak to a supervisor each time, and Frontier has been unable to confirm each time that they have submitted our flight for reimbursement. We just called again and after spending two hours on the phone with them and speaking to the supervisor they still won't even confirm with us that they have submitted for reimbursement or when we can expect our money. We are still waiting for any kind of confirmation that they are indeed sending us this reimbursement as promised. Each customer service representative we have talked to seems intent on keeping us from getting any information, they refuse to answer any question with a straight answer. Even if you don't end up having a horrendous experience with them, it's important to note that Frontier charges for everything, even checked bags, any drinks on board except water, seats that recline, and seats with a tray table big enough to hold anything besides a drink."

We chose budget airlines so we could spend more money on actually visiting places and experience what the USA has got to offer. Frontier flight was delayed and we had to leave our luggage behind (to get back to the UK) not knowing if we would ever see our belongings again. I can't praise enough the staff on the board of the plane (making every possible effort for us to get our luggage on time). As well as the only simple email of understanding I wrote to them that it was important for us to get our luggage back once we arrived home. We got our belongings free of charge and the customer service we received was exceptional! Frontier may be faced with challenges but at the end of the day, it all depends how they react to it. I personally would book a flight with you again! Don't be put off by all of the negative feedback. There is more to life than complains."

An hour later a gentleman shows up and checked me in and I head to the gate that my boarding pass says. I get to gate D17 and there I began to sit for a hour, after that hour I decided to go check the board and it shows that my gate was changed to C8. So I go to gate C8 and there is still no customer service in site. The flight continues to be delayed hours upon hours. So after sitting from 12pm-9pm a gentleman comes out and tell us that the flight was cancelled. I had to wait 2 more additional hours for someone to come and pick me up from the airport."

Now her I am on my way back home from Florida with another delayed flight of two hours. I will not be getting home till about 2 AM now. I talked to customer service desk and said I would have to pay 100 bucks to fly home at the original time I bought my ticket for. Now I’m stuck in the Denver airport again with and 8 hour layover. Would never recommend Frontier to anyone.

It had been five years since I had flown with them, which I suppose is just enough time to forget just how bad they are and allow myself to do it again. There is nothing positive I have to say about this airline. Perhaps the low cost fares would justify the terrible customer service, cancellations and delayed flights under the umbrella of ""you get what you pay for"" if the flights were actually low cost. But their hidden fees and charges quickly make the lowest far double or triple to cost as much as any other airline. I will never be tempted by one of their advertised fares again, and from now on will set all my travel search engines to exclude Frontier from the results completely."

On my way home I was told at the counter this free bag only applied to active duty. I calmly explained to the lady at the counter that I was told differently, as I politely paid the $50 fee her response was loudly and very rudely stating “I’m not going to argue with you”, “this conversation is over keep on moving”. This was my first flight with Frontier and I will never fly with them again. Any company that treats paying customers (especially veterans) like this does not deserve to earn the business of anyone."

My flight was delayed and passengers were not informed until 15 mins before we assumed the gate would open. On all of the monitors for departures, and online it says our flight is on time and we were all super disappointed once we found out we can’t board for another 2 hours. Unacceptable and unprofessional. Passengers should be informed at an early enough time to adjust for the inconvenience Frontier has placed on us. If we were not at the gate on time we would be denied our flight and turned around but it seems to be ok to the airline and staff to just tell people their flight is late without any concern, compensation or anything. This is why Frontier has bad reviews and unsatisfied customers."

We paid extra for seats near the very front of the plane for more leg room but had to stow our carry-on luggage halfway back in the plane, causing us to have to wait for half of the plane to get off after landing before we could get our bags and leave. All of the refreshments and snacks are pay only. Want that half a can of coke and small bag of pretzels that you'd get for free on other airlines? That'll be $2.99. Each. The seats themselves were very uncomfortable. I don't know if it's due to a lack of padding, or a worn out seat, but I ended up with bruises on one of my hips from just sitting in the plane for three hours. Unless I have no other choice, I won't be flying Frontier again."

I will never fly with this airline again. I have never been treated so horrible for a mistake by their staff. They have no sympathy and act as if they hate their jobs. Why are you in customer service people if you are a miserable human being?! I don’t appreciate that I was not helped at all when I shared how unhappy I was at their mistake. I was handed a small piece of paper with “call customer service!” That is the help that was given to me?! I would rather talk to an actual person and have them help me out versus spending another $300 plus on another ticket for their screw up. Beyond angry. All this could have been avoided if I received the slightest help or even a little sympathy.

Frontier would reimburse up to a certain amount to rebook our flight but of course flight prices are easily doubled on the day of flying. We ended up paying an extra $230 out of pocket and will now arrive at our destination 3 hours later which caused us to have to change airport pick up reservations and dining reservations also. This is the second unsatisfactory experience I have had with them in 4 months. I will no longer be flying with this airline.

No help no directions. Just a couple links that i am suppose to navigate on my phone in the middle of an airport. No flights out on any airlines till next day. I get a room and call Frontier. Almost an hr on the phone and they state that they will give me $400 and my ticket price which will basically pay for my airfare but i am stranded in Orlando for the night. The issue was a mechanical one and no fault of mine. I take care of my disabled husband. I not only missed a day of work but need to make arrangements for my husband and pay for a hotel. When talking to customer service they were rude interrupting and made no effort to try to rebook, no help with a hotel or any compassion at all. The ticket agents where just the same. Prices were not low enough to deal with the rudest, inconsiderate airline i have ever dealt with. I will not fly with them.. I will pay the extra for service and know i am protected."

When we got to the airport, we dropped off, went through security, arrived at our gate no problem. After waiting at our gate, we assumed our flight had been delayed so I walked to the counter and found out the flight had been cancelled. No announcement made. The woman at the counter said I needed to go to the main ticket counter (outside security) and get my “letter”. This letter basically tells you you are own your own and finding other flights is on you. They will reimburse a portion but to find a flight home for the same day on any airline is outside of their reimbursement limit. The people at the counters were very unhelpful and showed no sympathy or remorse for our “inconvenience”. The next available flight they offered us was 48 hours later, but they would not cover hotel or other fees that we would acquire while waiting for that. We ended up renting a car and drove 9 hours home. You can keep your refund vouchers Frontier, we will not be traveling with you again."

Frontier canceled my flight to Orlando just about 2 hours before departure. They did not even inform me of this cancellation and I learned it long after it was announced. I was given no assistance in rebooking by Frontier airport staff and told to help myself. This proved very stressful for me and my wife as other flights seats quickly vanished. I ended up purchasing 2 AA flights via Charlotte to Sarasota (and NOT Orlando!) and arrived to my destination at 2am instead of 9pm. My wife has serious medical issues and this 10-hour ordeal was extremely painful and stressful for her. In addition, I had to rebook a car rental for Sarasota instead of Orlando and my cost went up about $150. This airline should NOT be in business. Nonexistent customer service.

I was told to take some stuff out in order to make it lighter and was never offered a bag to put it in. The total cost of my one checked bag that weighed +5lb was 105.00 one way, not including the 40.00 return checked bag fee which puts the total at 145.00 for one checked bag that accidentally weighed 5lb's more than the limit on one leg of the trip. Astronomical. I called customer service letting them know what happened and asked for a refund of the 75.00 due to a mistake that will never happen again. They could have cared less, didn't budge, didn't do anything. I have to suck it up.

Yes, the flights are incredibly cheap, so I shouldn't expect much right? Exactly! But I think after 5 delays, it does get frustrating. Let me explain. I was flying home with Frontier with my husband and brother in law on an afternoon flight. I got my first email notification with 2.5 hours notice of a delay. Great! It sucks to have a delay, but at least they gave us enough heads up. Too bad we already got through security at the airport so we had to stay in there. Second delay, they gave us a 1 hour notice. The next 3 delays, we weren't so fortunate. The emails came less than 25 mins prior to take off time. Aren't we supposed to board 30 minutes prior to take off? So how can this company email us at 4:08pm letting us know that our departure time is at 4:30pm? Another email at 4:48pm with a departure time of 5:00pm?? The last email coming at 5:08pm with a departure time of 5:30pm. Our original flight was at 12:15pm and we were delayed over 5 hours. I understand that situations happen, but can you at least give us enough time to inform us of our departure time? It's not fun having to hover around the gate waiting and waiting to board. Not only that, it's not enough time for us to leave to grab meals (not to mention most of the good restaurants there take about 30 minutes to prepare food). On top of that Frontier decided that to compensate us, they would give us meal vouchers. Great! Just kidding! It was only a $10 meal voucher for a 5 hour delay. That's not even minimum wage in San Francisco! The Frontier staff was so flustered by all the angry customers that it took them forever to passout the meal vouchers. My brother in law had to step in and actually help pass out the meal vouchers so everyone could get them. By the way, not everyone received a meal voucher. And everyone who received them couldn't even redeem them because of how long it took too pass out. By the time My husband, Brother in Law, and I received our meal vouchers, it was 5:00pm. I thought we had enough time to grab food, but remember, at 5:08pm, we all received an email letting us know that our departure time was at 5:30pm. So I quickly grabbed my food and booked it to the gates. My Husband and his brother went to Burger King, which took them 25 minutes to receive their food, then having to book it to the gate. We all barely made it to the gate in time (we were literally the last few people to enter the gate). My experience doesn't end here. Frontier decided that a fair way to compensate everyone of this incredible inconvenience was to give us a $75 voucher for our next flight with Frontier. After this incredibly horrible experience, I wouldn't fly with Frontier. I personally emailed their customer service representative and after a few emails back and forth, she said the company is unable to do anything to compensate us futher because we did end up flying back with Frontier. After a 5 hour delay, I don't plan to stay in Vegas, so what do you expect? I want to get home as soon as possible! It's also absurd that a multi million dollar company can't refund us for the return flight home. So long story short, My husband, Brother in Law, and I don't plan to ever fly with Frontier. The poor communication and unhelpful customer service left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Cheap flights? Yes, but it comes with a price that I'm not willing to pay. I'll pay $500 more for a much better airline company next time."

As usual, Frontier Airlines has multiple problems with the aircraft. The thing that has always annoyed me about this particular airline is the lack of sense of urgency. I’m so sick and tired of being told about problems 30 minutes after they’ve been discovered. I’m so annoyed by the nonchalant way that passengers are notified of problems. Today, for example, we boarded and had been sitting at the gate for 30 minutes before anyone even bothered to tell us that there was a problem with one of the computers. Then, after no updates, another 30 minutes later, we are told that Maintenance was still looking into the first issue and that they would ALSO be looking at an engine problem. They just so casually grazed over the fact that not only are they investigating the original issue, but they are also investigating another, potentially greater issue. No apology was given. No updates have been given on either issue in the past 15 minutes. Love just being dangled from a string. Very annoyed passenger. Update- Just had to deplane and now we will potentially have to wait for another aircraft to become available."

We will never fly with them again, the staff was unfriendly, rude and incompetent. We missed our flight along with 10 other people (more were behind us so the total number who missed the flight is unknown) we arrived to the gate in time to make the flight but there was no one standing at the gate counter to alert the aircraft we were there. Someone went and found someone and she called down, she was told if you had called me 3 minutes ago I could have gotten them all on. We had all been there for 8 minutes. They were not at all helpful in rebooking us, they stated the next flight out was 4 days later. They would not offer connecting flights or to help us get to our destination. It was beyond the worst experience I have had with an airline and I have flown all over the world. They have the worst customer service and understaff in order to make more money.

For us on a plane the next morning to Denver leaving me and 5 children between the ages of 6-16 to sit in the airport for 12 hours. We missed 2 days of our vacation has to cancel and reschedule my rental car which ended up costing me more. Not only that a friend that was meeting us as a surprise for my daughter wasn’t able to check into our resort with out me leaving her to pay for a separate room until we got there. This is only the experience to Florida. My husband came into to Florida a couple days later from Louisville and both his flights were delayed. Now my two 16 year olds flew home today Wednesday) and the rest of us stayed. They delayed their flights out of Florida causing them to miss the connecting flight in Denver. Then tried to tell me they couldn’t get them home until Friday. Seriously two 16 year old girls stuck in Denver for 2 days knowing no one. Now we have been on the phone trying to get help as we are In Florida still and have been on the phone for over 2 hours! I don’t understand how they can run a business like this.

One passenger on my reservation could not check in without selecting a seat. The only seats available for selection required us to pay more on top of what we already paid for the ticket. We showed up to the airport early (as everyone is told to do) and no agents were at the counter. There was a sign for baggage drop that we stood in for 45 minutes before a lady came out and told us to go to the back of the line because there was really no baggage drop line and we had to go through the regular line. 2 of the agents were on their cell phones while checking customers in. The agents were very rude. We paid for our tickets, extra for baggage, extra to choose a seat to check in so we ended up paying more than any other airline.

I’ve been at Denver airport waiting 10 hours for a connecting flight to Salt Lake City when I learned there was an earlier flight to SLC. I asked if it was possible to change my flight to this earlier departure in the event that there were any no-shows. With 15 open seats and only 5 people in standby I was told that I could move to the earlier flight if I paid a rebooking fee of $99. That doesn’t make sense to me. Open seats? Already a paying ticket holder? To top things off, my original flight has been delayed 2 hours. So my legitimate question is this: how is it acceptable to charge someone a fee to for the inconvenience of making a few key strokes and mouse clicks to get them on a flight with plenty of open seats, then in return, after actually causing a real inconvenience to me, expect things to be settled with a simple “we’re sorry for the delay”? There is a clear double standard in the way I’ve been treated by Frontier and the cooperation they have expected from me."

We got off the plane were offered no assistance, no hotel, no help. 50+ of us slept in the PVD airport last night after receiving no help. I got booked on another flight for today and 1130 and that flight has already been delayed an hour - trying to be understanding but this is ridiculous. I have never had such a bad experience with an airline before. My last trip on Frontier I was delayed ~4 hours and upon landing was emailed a travel voucher (without even asking for one).

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Antonio,October 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Las Vegas to Philadelphia via San Antonio. Where do I begin to describe the nightmare that is Frontier Airlines. I booked a flight 2wks ago to leave Las Vegas and travel to Philadelphia. The flight I bought had me on Frontier Airlines from Las Vegas to San Antonio and after a 3hr layover in San Antonio I was supposed to board a flight (still with Frontier) and proceed to my destination to Philly. I was supposed to arrive in Philadelphia yesterday which was Thursday night (10/18) and stay through Sunday. The airline to take me home was American Airlines. While typing this message I’m in San Antonio and it’s Friday 10/19. I never boarded the plane to take me to philly because Frontier canceled the flight. When the plane arrived they made an announcement that the pilot is requesting for a new tire and it would be about an hour wait to get the tire. Two hours later they announced that finally they would start boarding the plane in 18min from that moment. Twenty minute later they announced that they would start boarding 15min from that moment and then 10min later they announced they were canceling the flight all together because the paper work regarding the tire swap was going to take too long. Well all hell broke loose from there. People were upset (understandably) however the Frontier ticket agents were rude and without a sincere apologetic tone as they hand us a print out that explains Frontiers canceled flight policy. First option is to just get a full refund and find your own way home. The amount of you refund to be mailed to you within a week or two. The second option was to purchase a new ticket with another airline and Frontier would reimburse up to $500 for your new ticket later by sending you a check in the mail after you email them your receipt that you bought another ticket. This all happened at night so of course they brought up that if we had to get a hotel room then we’d have to come out of pocket for that and they would reimburse but only up to $150 for a hotel room also to be sent later by way of a check in the mail. Unfortunately for me, this was my first Frontier flight, I had never flown with them before. And while I understand that things happen like the plane and the tire issue, it’s my opinion that Frontier should have a better policy as to how they assist their customers in the event of a cancelation that outside of bad weather. We’re all not rich and all don’t have $500 or more to buy a flight on the spot to get to where we need to go within 24 to 48hrs.. All flights out with other airlines started at over $500 and only went up from there. At the moment I’m sitting at the airport in San Antonio, having been here for 24hrs now wondering how I get home simply because I’m one of the unlucky ones who’s bank account isn’t cushioned enough to purchase a $500 or more plane ticket out of here. Additionally, the portion of the money for my American Airlines flight home from Philly back to Vegas is now gone down the drain all thanks to Frontier a Airlines. Thanks for nothing Frontier!! To who ever is reading this.. If your considering this airline then don't. Your money would be better off spent with an airline that treats their customers better in the event of an emergency and there are airlines with better canceled flight policies that won’t cause YOU the customer more money and more headache to be taken care of should a series of events happen that are beyond you control."

It is not ""low fare"" - there are fees for literally everything! Want to sit next to your friend or significant other on the way? That will cost you $15 to $30 per seat each way depending on the part of the plane you select. Want to check a bag? That will cost you $40 each way. How about a carry-on bag? Another $40 each way. So, on top of my original fare, I paid $320 to get 2 seat assignments each way, 2 checked bags each way and 2 carry-on items each way. On top of that, my flight home was delayed. Initially, the delay was about 20 minutes. But, once we were boarded, we were on the plane for 4 HOURS! Just sitting on the tarmac (btw, their seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced on a plane - almost no padding/cushion). The first issue was some part was frozen/stuck underneath the plane - so they had to fix that. We finally left the gate to taxi to the deicing area. Once the plane was deiced (almost 2 hours after the original departure time) they realized that the cockpit door was not closed appropriately. We then had to taxi all the way back to the gate and wait for them to fix the cockpit door. After that, we again taxi'd back to the deicing area. The entire process, before we actually took-off, lasted 4 hours. To make matters worse, they lost my checked bag. They do not have a scanning/tracking system, which is pretty scary. They told me to come back the next day to see if my bag comes from the next flight from Denver to San Jose. Sure enough, my bag arrived almost a day after I arrived. The funny part, Frontier emailed me even after I received my bag, to apologize, that they are not able to locate it. They still think my bag is lost. Do not fly with this airline.

I'm going to make this real short, I've used Cheap Caribbean for many trips especially to the Dominican Republic. I recently booked a trip to Punta Cana and got a ""GREAT DEAL' , however to keep the cost down they used Frontier Airlines. Not knowing their reputation did not think twice. We showed up at the Philadelphia desk over a hour before the flight was boarding. There were three couples trying to board including my wife and myself. The clerk states that We are late and that we can board the plane however not our luggage and that it would get there three days later. Obviously this was not a viable option, so we asked for the supervisor. The supervisor arrives about twenty minutes later, and said if my lead person says your late that's it. I asked how late were and she said 6 minutes but then she let the one couple board with luggage because the clerk then told the supervisor that we were not late, however we were all standing there together. I cannot believe I am even writing this write now , but I truly want people to know what a horrible experience we had . Needless to say we did not make our trip. Please be aware of the flights that you choose with Cheap Caribbean, it's well worth it to pay a little more for a piece of mind. Never use Frontier Airlines."

For the rest, Frontiers hidden fees when it comes to baggage check, and paying for overpriced beverages on the flight instantly makes them a no go. The service is nothing to gloat about and the aircraft  are dirty and unwelcoming.

I was warned through email for weeks and again at the airport to purchase a carry on ticket (You are allowed a personal item, but the size limit is pretty small. My purse barely made the cut off.) Once we were all seated and ready to go the flight attendants notice a man trying to sneak his bag on. Needless to say they told him he needed to get off the plane and pay for the bag or not fly. He made a big scene about it. The attendants were very nice about it, the police had to come and remove him. The rest of the flight was fine. The second leg of my flight was fine.

When using their mobile site to check in and purchase the luggage, there was a timeout error which caused the check-in status to go through without even agreeing to the hazardous materials clause (illegal?). Had to call customer support to manage the reservation, and the phone menu said there would be a $25 charge to speak to an agent to change anything (never applied). When I finally was able to get to a human he modified my reservation and added the bag and selected the seat. Checking in took 1.5 hours with the combined online and phone support effort. Flight was over an hour late departing the first half of my journey. Now am on the return flight. While we landed 25 minutes early, the plane Has been on the tarmac, sitting, no action for over 1.5 hours. We’ve received 5 15-minute updates, one extra water service. Frontier is wildly inefficient and not punctual. The service is bare minimum. No frills means you are only offered water service for free, the rest requires a credit card.

I purchased a ticket with Frontier due to the low prices, will not be making that mistake again. The flight was cancelled due to a bird going through the windshield as the plane was landing. This is understandable of course, but the way this airline is addressing the situation is absolutely ridiculous. I could not even get to the counter with one CS serving 300 passengers at 10 min per passenger speed. Tried to call the Frontier phone number, not available. Had to rent a car and drive. The circumstances of why the flight is cancelled was out of Frontier's hands but the fact that they do not have the capability to get a different plane or have a more reasonable second flight option. Talking to their representatives on the phone is impossible. The customer service with this airline is non existent. Will be voicing my disgust with this airline to any and everyone."

You're better off flying with another airline. My husband and I flew RT from Chicago we paid $45 for our checked bag. Our return trip the same bag we traveled with cost $125.00. we was told our luggage was a few pounds over weight. I was told I was being charged $75.00 for the few extra pounds but actually charged $125.00. We've called Customer Service only to tell us no refunds. After back and forth explanations we were told a manager will call us back. Still waiting. I had high hopes and great expectation for this airline, so unfortunate. "

The discounted price of $78 each way ended up being over $300 after baggage charges, seating charges and drinks / snacks. Did not pay extra for early boarding, would have been additional $50. The  flight was delayed an hour at scheduled boarding time for mechanical issues. My real dissatisfaction though is being hit with a bunch of expense after purchasing the tickets. The price was the same if not more than the other airlines after all was said and done. And I could at least have had a reclining, fabric covered seat. And a chair back tray big enough to hold a cup. And an in flight magazine. Not to mention a barf bag. Also, the poor flight crew had to do a 5 minute advertisement for the Frontier miles credit card. I found that extremely annoying."

I talked to 5 different people who barely spoke English and not one could answer our questions. Don't bother with signing up for their rewards program because you get absolutely nothing with it. It's extremely difficult to use miles. I was upgraded to Elite status and they won't even give you a free can of coke or a carry on bag. The whole program is a joke.

The employees make it known that their work life is so miserable which then makes the customers experience horrible. Also, its 2018 and these airlines dont have wifi? Get with it Frontier, you are an embarrassment of an airline. I am a frequent flyer and bought these because it was the only airline available for the specific times I needed to fly. "

We left our contact information and headed to car rental. While there, we received a call that the bag had been found. Staff refused to wait the 15 minutes it would have taken to return for the bag. Was told we would have to wait until 11 pm, which was three hours later. We decided to return to airport following day around noon to get bag and was told no frontier staff would be available until 8pm, as they only show two hours before flight. I was due in Vancouver that night. I was assured that the bag would be delivered to our hotel either Monday, Tuesday at latest. We called them on Monday night to check on bag; no answer. We did not receive bag on Tuesday. No calls from frontier. We talked yet again to the baggage people who were located in Denver and was told they would take our message and have someone in Seattle return our call. Never received. We called everyday the entire week. We had to buy everything new, and I had to go without diabetic pump supplies and monitoring supplies as they were in bag. We never received a call. We returned to Sea-Tec on Saturday evening. A frontier staff took us to the cage where it had been the entire week. We were told the bag person in charge was out sick or on vacation. No one cared about the distress of not having the bag delivered, that frontier has no staff on site to open the bag when we were there on that sat and sun to unlock the cage so we could have our supplies. We were told all medical supplies should be in carry on. It was the worst experience ever; one of the most stressful weeks of our lives without access to our stuff, numerous unanswered calls, hours spent trying to find someone on site to even confirm bag was there, going without diabetic supplies. What a joke for a company. I will never use their service again. Frontiers effort to make up for their service? A reimbursement for the checked bag and a promise to reimburse purchases up to 100-200 dollars a day for items needed to buy. I bought the cheapest toiletries I could find and it certainly exceeded their max reimbursement. What they don’t reimburse for is the psychological distress to be in another country with no supplies, no medical equipment and all our time spent in the drama of dealing with a company who has no staff available during the days except for 90 min before a late night flight. I strongly discourage anyone from considering using this company. I absolutely guarantee they do not care nor will make any effort to do the right, let alone professional, thing for their customer. And to their poor personnel who are contract workers for the mere two hours before flights? I feel bad for them. Watching customer after customer expressing their frustration to a low paying attendant who has no control to make anything better. Frontier should be ashamed of themselves."

When I asked why, I did not receive an appropriate explanation and no solution was offered. The flight attendants were beyond disrespectful and presented themselves as though they did not want to be at work, almost annoyed. I ended up missing my special event due to the tardiness of this airline and when reaching out to the airline to discuss my concerns, I was shut down and told that due to my flight being completed, there was ""nothing they can do.""

On August 21st I had a flight from Sacramento to Las Vegas that was originally scheduled for a 7:40pm. When I arrived at the airport, the flight was already delayed an hour. Okay, not a huge issue until it was delayed again and again, until ultimately being cancelled around 10pm. I had received a notification on my cell phone that the flight was cancelled and when I went to the counter to confirm this (As no announcement had been made), they tried to tell me that the information was incorrect and they had heard nothing about the flight being cancelled. Backtracking to the ""meal vouchers"" they handed out, at about 8:50pm, and guess what time all of the Sacramento restaurants stop serving food...9pm. Thanks for the useless voucher. At the counter, once they finally announced the cancelled flight, they announced that they would be providing a document that stated how to rebook a new flight either with Frontier or with another airline (that would be reimbursed up to $400). Given that the next Frontier flight into Las Vegas wasn't until two days later, I rebooked with another airline through the website that Frontier required and was on a flight to Vegas the next morning. The letter that was given out at the gate stated that Frontier would be reimbursing (via checks) the refund for the cancelled flight and the amount for the rebooked flight (up to $400) within 10 business days. It's been over a month. They've ignored all of my contact submissions and refund requests and at this point I am planning on reporting the charges to my credit card as fraudulent and seeing how far that will get with me with them. Do not waste your money. The cheap rate is not worth the headache that will inevitably ensue."

There are no complimentary snacks on the plane, and they charge for everything like bags and even your seat selection. The worst thing though, is that the counters to check your bags dont even open until 2 hours before the flight. We always try to get to the airport early because traffic is unpredictable, and it gives us extra time to make sure the kids are good to go. However, we end up stranded at the ticket counters with two bored kids and giant bags and car seats that would not be possible to drag around while shopping or eating. Also, the Seattle airport didn't have much to do before going all the way the through security. It consistently makes the airport experience terrible. Then there is another consistent issue where they often board planes an hour late without updating their information boards and it has been confusing several times...and again...standing in line with no clue how long it's going to be for an hour with bored kids is hell. In general, their flights are often canceled or delayed."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Salt Lake City,September 2018,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  On my way to Salt Lake City from Albuquerque, both of my flights were delayed. This was only the beginning of my problems with This airline. On my way home was supposed to originally leave Saturday morning at 11:23 AM. Flight was delayed due to some reason unbeknownst to me. Because of this delay and I had a connection flight with the same airline, I would end up missing my connection flight. This airline wanted to do nothing to help me. They could not get me on another flight for a couple of days, but then only offered me a one night hotel stay. What was I supposed to do the other night, sleep on the streets because they had an issue? Then I decided to get a flight with another airline, because I actually did need to get home to get back to work. Believe it or not my work life does not revolve around airlines having delays. So I get the other ticket, and was told they could not refund my ticket, even though the delay was their fault. So they won’t refund your money, can’t get you on a plane for a couple more days, and only give you a hotel for one night and leave you out with nowhere to stay for the other two? Maybe I’m crazy, but shouldn’t the company who is putting you out to be the ones who are inconvenienced and not the paying customer? So not only would I have been left with no where to stay, I also had to get a new airline, and ended up paying $231 out of pocket just so I could still get home on the day that I needed to. Because “they” have a delay. This is the worst service I’ve ever received, and I will never ever fly this airline again, and I recommend that you don’t either, unless you would like a big headache and to be out of pocket - at the mercy of their ineffective policies, that protect them, while leaving those of us who are paying for a service are put out on the street and out of pocket to cover their inability to Perform. If I’m paying for a flight, and you have a delay, then you need to be the one that is in convenience not me. That’s called customer service, and simple common sense. In the end, the manager at the customer service did refund my ticket for the one-way home. However because I had to buy a new ticket the same day, I was still out $231 of my own money regardless of the $150 refund that I was given. Huge inconvenience, not to mention the worst service I’ve ever received from an airline"

This is the 10th or so time I have used Frontier simply because of the proximity of the airport and because of the price but it’s not even worth it anymore. Two of my flights have been cancelled and i have never had a flight that was actually on time. Currently sitting on an aircraft for what’s been over an hour after boarding early (I should have known better than to think this was going to be the first flight with zero problems), and it’s not due to the airport, it’s due to the “computer system being reset,” isn’t that supposed to be checked prior to even leaving a gate? If we were still at the gate I would have gotten off. If you are looking for a reliable flight experience, do yourself a favor and listen to everyone else’s reviews along with mine and avoid. Their customer service is absolutely terrible as well, give out vouchers to “satisfy” you, no thanks no one wants a voucher to maybe fly your airline again.

So I lost my hotel reservation, had to take a night in a hotel near SA and finally paid $658 for each ticket with an other airline because Frontier was not able to reschedule a similar flight within 3 days.

Although we understand that these issues do happen, we were not informed of the cancellation until we arrived at the airport. The flight was cancelled at least 24 hours beforehand when we attempted to check into our flight via the app and there seemed to be an issue. At that point we did not expect a cancellation because we were allowed to pay for our carry-on baggage. Once we arrived for our flight at DIA we found out that no other flights (Frontier or other airlines) were available to get to Bozeman, MT. As such, we were forced to fly into a different airport, then drive, to get to our destination. That's when the real frustration began. We were told that we would be reimbursed $400 per passenger (I was traveling with my wife). After two months of negotiation Frontier finally cut a check. We negotiated to get the check up to $500 per person, but they first deducted the cost of the original flight and our baggage fee. The real kicker is that our last minute flight (through a different airline) had a cost of $1,000 per person. All in, we spent over $2,400 and were reimbursed $1,000 (still waiting for that check so we'll see about that) plus two $250 Frontier travel vouchers (insert sarcastic excitement). If you have alternative options other than Frontier, choose the other airline. If you have no other options, strongly consider staying home."

Unfortunately, there is nothing that I can say positive about this airline. It was my first time to fly Frontier. I should have known when I only paid $348.00 for ""2"" round trip tickets on a non-stop flight that it was too good to be true. First time they rescheduled my flight, they had me stopping and changing planes in Denver. Ok, the times weren't far off, so no biggie, right? Wrong. Because they decided to change my itinerary a second time. This time, I had to arrive the day before and then coming back, I had a ""12 hour"" layover from midnight until noon the next day, so I also got back home a day late. But for my inconvenience, Frontier offers ""2"" $100.00 vouchers to both me and my husband ($400.00 total). Wait for the catch on these ""I'm sorry vouchers"". You have to book (not travel) within 90 days or you lose your vouchers. My husband works for Marathon Petroleum and their schedule hasn't even come out yet for next year; so you tell me, how am I supposed to book another vacation when I don't even know what days he's off yet. So I call Frontier and ask if there is any way to ""delay"" the date of booking and using the vouchers. The answer is ""No"". (Like I thought it was going to be anything else). This was my first and last time to ever fly Frontier. You would be very wise to heed my warning, as well. Everyone I talked to in line, in the airport, on the plane, had all experienced this same thing with Frontier. They do not care about their customers. In their minds, since their flights are cheap, basically your service is cheap, as well. Nope, no more for me and my family."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Atlanta,September 2018,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,4,"  I'm actually typing this from the air on my flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico back to Atlanta.  Several weeks ago I booked a R/T flight thru Frontier to San Juan to celebrate my birthday this past weekend. I've flown with them one other time on a trip to Los Angeles a couple of years back.   Which, I might add for a cross country flight, was uneventful.  Now, departing from Atlanta on Thursday 9/20/18, my flight was delayed an hour for reasons unbeknownst to me.  A mild setback-- but no biggie.  I had a fabulous trip until it was time to depart on Sunday.  Approx 30 min before take off an announcement was made that there would be a delay due to mechanical issues.  Then 15min later we were told that our 440pm flight was going to be delayed until the next day.  After grabbing my bags from baggage claim, I proceeded to the Frontier counter to see what my options were.  The line was wrapped around the building.  I decided to take a chance to see if just maybe I could find another flight with a different airline departing that evening.  Tried Delta, American and Southwest. No such luck!  In fact, many of the counters were closing and their last flights had already departed for the evening. Keep in mind at this point its only around 515ish. So back to Frontier I go and hope for the best.  I stood in line for hours. By around 815pm I finally got up to the counter, was told I was booked for the 11am flight the next day and was given two meal vouchers totalling $25 and are only good for the airport eateries.  When I inquired about accommodations, I was told that at this time they weren't offering any hotel accomodation, assistance, vouchers, nothing. For the sake of time I decided not to argue with the clerk and just took my vouchers and proceeded to look for dinner. Now it's 830pm (which is when I was expected to land in ATL) and most of the shops in the airport are closed with the exception of a coffee shop and one restaurant.  After hiking across the airport, luggage in tow, I see a line at the one restaurant still open for us to use our dinner  voucher.  This has to be a joke.  After 20 min of standing in line with no movement, I gave up.  Went outside to attempt to catch a taxi and it was also a ghost town.  After waiting around for 10min or so an unmarked black van pulled up and asked if I needed a ride.  Could've been a taxi.  Could've been a serial killer. At that point, I didn't care. I was exhausted, my body ached and I just wanted to get to my room.  For $10, he drove me to a hotel in Carolina (Hotel La Playita which was great btw) where I had made reservations while in line for food moments earlier. I know that things happen- sometimes out of our control. I understand that flights are cancelled and delayed all day, every day. That's not my issue.  But the fact that our flight was cancelled due to the plane leaking hydraulic fluid and Frontier making it the passenger's problem to figure everything out, is where I take issue.  Scrambling to find sleeping arrangements, taxis, meals, etc can add up. In my case, my best friend had flown back home to DC on JetBlue so I was stranded alone and having to foot the bill by myself. This cancellation wasn't due to weather or some other natural disaster and the responsibility of their customers fell on Frontier.  Shame on you Frontier Airlines in your lack of compassion for your passengers and for totally mishandling this situation."

This was my first time purchasing a ticket to fly with Frontier Airlines. I know that it will also be my last. The flight was initially delayed for a tire change. It was a 6:30am flight. It wasn’t until 6:15 (boarding time) that the passengers were given this information and told hat it would be another 45 minutes until boarding. At 7am an agent was sitting at the Frontier ticketing desk wearing the frontier logo and just sat there watching all of the passengers waiting to board. I approached her and asked if there was any update. She answered that tires are pretty important and take time. I replied that I knew this but would appreciate some kind of update being that the quoted 45 minute delay had already passed. She said “ok” and proceeded to sit. Moments later she left the desk and went behind the door to the on ramp and never came back. We didn’t leave until 8am and didn’t arrive to my destination until 1 hour and 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst flights with poor communication and terrible customer service. I don’t foresee a successful future for Frontier Airlines and will never recommend them.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to New York,September 2018,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and son had a flight home from Austin, Texas today. They got to the airport and found out it was delayed. They kept delaying it more and more. When I called customer service they told me the flight from Atlanta to New York had air conditioning issues. So I said “what has that got to do with anything”? I asked where the plane was at the moment and they had no clue. The plane finally left 4 hours later. It was a connecting flight at Cincinnati but they didn’t have to get off the plane. Meanwhile online they had all the wrong times when the flight was leaving even after it left. It was delayed in Cincinnati for about 1 1/2 hours. I had to pick them up so after it finally departed I checked online to see when it was going to arrive. Needless to say it had it 1/2 hour after takeoff but it’s a 2 hour flight. So I called customer service again, which is outsourced to the Philippines (which I don’t care if they knew what they were doing) and she said the plane was arriving at 10:20 and it 10:40 and they just departed. I was so angry that I said to the girl “why aren’t your computers updated. That’s very dangerous for people on the ground trying to get information on their loved one 35000 mile in the air. Your website is wrong and you don’t have the proper information either”. She put me on hold and came back with a more reasonable time. So now I have to pick them up at 2:00 in the morning. So I will never use Frontier again and don’t recommend them. Also after you add in the luggage and seat it’s almost as much as any other airline."

We were given a one night stay at a hotel. no provisions were made to help us out."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Atlanta,September 2018,3.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10," This airline deserves more than its rating! I've been flying with Frontier Airlines for a while. I'm a frequent traveler and this exceeds my expectations a lot in terms of low fare budget airlines. They are not your typical expensive airline so their perks aren't as many as Delta for example, but for what you pay it's much more."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Denver,September 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Canceled first flight 1 hr before and no one knew why with no other flight options except for days later. Do not recommend booking that same flight option (it’ll get changed too.) you only get reimbursed up to so much. Had to book with other line to get to my destination. So more $$ for one way.  And surprise to go back home 10 days later the red eye flight gets delayed - try to see someone at a counter., no one came had to call - now sitting overnight in hopes it takes off next option in am. If canceled next flight option is 4 days from now! If delayed due to weather etc, then understandable but neither of these situations Are even answer. I am by myself and can suck it up sleeping at an airport but if I had kids this would truly be a nightmare. you have to call for any chance, but they do nothing there either. I’m curious if I’ll even get to be on a frontier flight. I truly will never attempt to fly Frontier again."

Asked why and they just said the plane hasnt left yet. Over 3 hours of delay. Still waiting to see if I get delayed again. Options is get my money back or get a food voucher. All food places are closed now. Just stay away from Frontier Airlines unless you have hours to kill in an airport. Happens so often that customer service has an I don't care attitude about it. I hope they fix the problems or go out of business.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,September 2018,1.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,8," This was the best option I had to fly from Orlando to Las Vegas without any layovers and after reading the negative reviews, I went on the plane with butterflies in my stomach (the nervous and painful kind and not the high school crush coming closer kind). I was actually pleased with how smooth the trip went. We flew on time and reached Vegas ahead of schedule. The cabin crew were efficient and attentive and although the seats felt like sitting in a school cafeteria, I didn’t mind them much. I will never forget the moment the female cabin crew picked up the phone and said “yeah, Las Vegas baby” as it was iconic. I didn’t go wrong when choosing Frontier Airlines. Also, I really appreciate the flexibility and the ability to add extra options and perks like extra checked and carry on bags, etc... whenever you feel like it with very reasonable prices."

In Denver, there were 8 or 9 desks with only one person accepting checked bags (which they also make you pay for) and a line of more than 50 people! We got to the airport 2.5 hours early and barely made our flight on time. Almost everyone we dealt with from Frontier was rude and/or ambivalent, and they went the extra mile to make sure we felt like cattle. The seats were barely more comfortable than standing and even the tray tables are pathetic. I knew going in it wasn't going to be amazing, but wow was I surprised at just how patently horrific it was to fly on Frontier. Next time I fly, I am going to pay extra to Alaska Airlines, just because they are not Frontier. I will never, ever fly this airline again, in fact, I would prefer riding a seatless bicycle to Denver than flying Frontier Airlines, and that's not hyperbole. With all of their hidden fees and charges, you end up paying more than you would to fly a decent airline anyway. Run the other way away from this awful business."

He had never flown before and was super excited. We got to airport before 5am only to discover about an hour later that the flight was delayed until 10:30am (not sure if airline was at fault or not). Although the wait was bad it effectively ruined our trip bc I had planned to drive to Breckenridge and spend only 5-6 hours at their adventure park so we could make it back for the return flight. As a result of the delay, we drove up there but only had less than an hour before having to drive back to the airport and drop of the rental car. This trip was pretty much a bust. I emailed customer service and was impressed that I received a response the next day (Sunday) who really took the time to express his apologies and sympathy for my son’s big day being ruined - very long email and was quite personable. I didn’t expect that personal touch which was appreciated along with the vouchers they sent to cover a future flight. That level of customer service is rarely seen these days at larger companies which is why I will fly again with Frontier which I probably would not have before receiving that response."

The airline lost our checked car seat and the only solution they offered was to give us a car seat belonging to someone else that they had lost on a previous flight. This car seat was too big for our baby and did not even meet the safety legal requirements in regards to our childs age, height, and weight. The airline offered no other help or service on the problem their inconpetence created. It would have been cheaper to buy another ticket for the car seat as we will be having to buy a new one."

We had to leave the plane after being inside till 10:00 AM . Around 11:00 Am announced that maintenance issue was resolved and took over 120 minutes to get paper works ready. This is is an evidence of poor management and lack of communications on all staff at Frontier Airlines."

We’ve had three round trips with Frontier in the past two months, each leg of which has been delayed by a minimum of 1-2 hours, the latest of which was canceled after twelve hours in the airport being told our plane would be arriving shortly. For a budget conscious customer that flies frequently, we’ve decided it’s no longer worth the savings flying with a Frontier. The headaches of missing work, expensive reservations and events along with full days at airports waiting for a plane that won’t come isn’t worth a few hundred in savings."

Well just got done with one of the worst flight experiences of my life! My flight was delayed 10 hrs. They gave us no explanation as to why and all of the people working the counter had no idea what they were doing and they didn’t really even care to try and help. Because of this delay I was going to miss my connecting flight in Denver. Frontier offered no help because they don’t work with any other airlines to help you get onto another flight home. I will never book with Frontier Airlines again because you truly get what you pay for. I would rather walk to my destination than fly on Frontier Airlines. Please save your money.

After I got back I check with my lawyer, it is valid for a year starting 04/2018, so by law I'm allowed to travel with it.

First they say to be two hours early for your flight and they were not even open. Finally they check us in around 4 am and say the flight is delayed as the plane got in late. We said ok no problem and go through all the security measures. Then I check the sign to see our flight is canceled, by the way no one announced this. We had to go all the way back to the front desk, the lady was rude saying no-one gave you your options. No sorry for the inconvenience, or any help whatsoever to find a new flight. Then we call the customer service for help and they say the only option is for a refund. The customer representative was not understanding at all. He didn’t offer anything like another flight, we had to book our own tickets with another airline and start the process all over. Waking up at 2 am to catch a flight at 6:50. To hear it's delayed until 11am then to 12 and then cancelled. I will never fly on this airline ever!"

Originally flying round trip buffalo to Orlando and back, our BUF-MCO flight was delayed over 5 hrs and eventually cancelled. Forced to book onto JetBlue (who were awesome!) now, in Orlando headed back to Buffalo, we boarded and were informed that there was an issue “they don’t have the parts to fix so it has to come from outside the airport” -  we’ve now been delayed over 1 hour and no doubt this will turn into a cancellation. They don’t have any update on if they will even be able to get the parts. On the plus side I found the staff fairly nice, they refunded our original cancellation without much hassle. Issued 10$ voucher for food. They needed to be more up front that the flight was going to be cancelled. This whole time I can only wonder one thing - how does this airline stay in business?!"

Sat in front of a woman with a 2 yr old child she let continually kick the metal table behind me, she did not stop him until I had to tell them to stop. Why are children flying as lap children at this age, they are not bottle fed. She should have been required to buy him a seat. Why is a child not required a car seat and belt at this age yet, I have to have mine on almost the whole duration. Its ok for a child to bounce around if there is a crash but not a adult? Is this what they gave up tvs for to give children a free ticket to annoy paying customers. I was told if my son over 6 feet and almost 300 lbs could not fit in a seat I had to buy him a 2nd seat yet this child clearly could not fit without problems and was not required to purchase 1? The plane left 10 minutes early leaving my 6 family members behind at the gate. Leaving early is a privilege for having all passengers on board before time to leave yet they left 8 checked in people at the gate to do this? I did not find out about this until a seat belt release period as my 12 yr old daughter had to sit alone because her grandma, aunt, uncle and cousins were not there in back of plane, as my ticket was row 6 due to space for my son. If there were extra seats why was I required to sit by the bad mom who could not control her kid. Stewardess not doing job. At the end of flight passengers got there bags and stood in the walk way making it difficult for others to get theirs and return to seat. Trying to rush past customers who payed 33 dollars to choose a front seat. No stewardess leading them until I got in front of all them and told everyone in rows 1-6 before me to go and told everyone behind me they dont have no manners to wait their turn. "

The flight was first delayed then ultimately cancelled. I went to the ticket counter and asked for a refund because their next flight was 2 days later and I couldn't wait that long due to being on a time crunch and having to be back for training a few days later for the air Force. I was told to call a number which I did and was on hold for over 30 minutes then finally talked to a person that I could barely understand. If you want to fly somewhere don't fly Frontier Airlines because you'll probably never get there and they'll have you jump through hoops to get refunded.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,July 2018,2.0,3.0,,,,3.0,2,no,2,"  Frontier Airlines has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I suppose it's understandable that flights sometimes get cancelled for no apparent reason/explanation - but they make it very difficult to get the promised refund. I have been waiting since early July (for a July 3 flight) to get a refund. It's now September 10. I have jumped through all their hoops (twice) and was finally approved the refund about three weeks ago - but despite my having stated in all documents and correspondence what my mailing address is they stated they are mailing to an old address where I have not lived for over 6 years. I have emailed, called, went through their website to try to get his corrected and zero response over the last three weeks to this request. Assuming they will send it to wrong address and everything will be delayed even further - who knows how long. They also make it very difficult to get anyone on the phone; it's pretty clear they don't want to actually talk with their customers! So very frustrating and a lot of wasted time for something that was their fault to start with."

I originally booked this flight in July for trip this month and thought I paid for an economy class seat. I did the pre check in the day before and at that time, I had to pick my seat which was fine. However, when I picked one of the few seats left, I was charged an additional $28.00. I thought I was being moved to business class which is supposed to be a larger seat in the front of the plane. When we finally boarded I found my seat and it was not business class and was the most uncomfortable I have ever had on a plane. Hard as a rock, little leg room, skinny and overall unpleasant. When I finally got off the plane I was more tired from that flight than from all the walking I did the day before. Plane did leave early and staff were relatively pleasant but that does not excuse charging me extra for something I thought was paid for. If I ever fly again, rest assured it will not be on Frontier and I will advise my friends to choose another airline."

An hour before our flight was supposed to board, we get a text saying it had been cancelled and there were going to give us $400 for a ticket on a different airline. Even with that, it left us having to spend $1500 on tickets and not to mention the struggle of trying to find a new flight and where our luggage was - all because they “didn’t have a crew”.

I've worked as a customer service rep for 5 years and I know things can be out of our control, so usually I'm a very cool and collected customer who is easy to talk to and easy to please, but the foolery I experienced at the hands of Frontier Airlines definitely took me out my character. I had my Detroit flight out of Austin canceled literally an hour after the time we where suppose to depart. I'm a mother to a 10 month old, who is traveling with me and I've never been off the west coast where I'm originally from. I never had a problem with the flight being canceled. What I did have a problem with is how they refused to accommodate a mother with her fussy 10 month old. They basically told me all they could do is give me a ""voucher"" for my flight (which isn't even a voucher it's just the money for the flight I paid for, coming back, so I can pay for my flight for tomorrow again) and that the earliest plane was 24 hours from that point (It was 9 in the morning, mind you, we where suppose to depart at 720) and that they don't do hotel vouchers and that me and my daughter will just have to wait it out. Then on top of that, they lost my bags for a couple hours. It's been well over 10 years since I've been on a plane, and now my experience has been ruined! I wasn't given any blankets until I had to hunt a random employee down and ask. They didn't offer to pay for Dinner. I've never experienced such horrible customer service quality in my life. Frontier Airlines is the definition of selfish money hungry company that doesn't care about the people it's suppose to be accommodating. The phone representative play phone games with you and just switch you back and forth between employees like its a big game. I'm so disgusted by the behavior of this business and its employees and I'll definitely be warning people about this. I hope you all heed warnings and stay far away from this airline."

Our connecting flight from DEN to CVG departed on Sept. 3rd at 12:25am, so we missed that flight, but was rebooked prior to departing from PDX, for a flight that would leave September 4th at 12:30 am. We were also given a hotel voucher prior to departing from PDX, and were told we could stay there until our flight from DEN to CVG. Upon arriving at the hotel at 7:00am (After traveling for almost 24hrs straight) We were told we had to leave the hotel by 11:00am, we called Frontier for help, and they told us ""to go back to the airport and talk to customer service"", which was out of the question. I asked for a number to call the airport, and they don’t even have a number to contact them. We never checked into that hotel, but instead had to go check into another hotel. I called into Frontier customer service late afternoon the next day on Monday Sept. 3rd, to explain the situation again, but was told us they do not handle refunds and I have to go talk to airport customer service. They gave us 2 $50 vouchers, which I told her we didn't want because we will not be flying with you all again...when I got to the airport that evening I went straight to customer service at the check in. I had Frontier employees just walk away from me and tell me they couldn't help me (Including the supervisor) I then went to the customer service next to where we board the flight, and they told me ""they would've never given a voucher like that, and that I should go back to Portland and talk to them there"", that they don't handle these type of situations, told me it shows online that I settled for 2 x $50 vouchers and finally gave me the same number to call that told me to go to the airport. I am very much paraphrasing all that your employees told me, as it was absolutely dumbfounding how they talked to and treated their customer(s)."

They kept pushing the departure back hour by hour until 9:30pm-- then cancelled it outright. They only offered a $400 reimbursement, when round trip replacement flights were up to $800! (Labor day weekend). Luckily, she had booked a one way from CMH to Austin and was flying back to Columbus on Delta already, so she was able to find a one way to Austin on Delta for the next morning (9/7) for $550. The gate agent was quite rude and told her she ""was not allowed to ask questions."" Later this same gate agent in Columbus clearly helped a man get his baggage, but ignored my fiance (female) when she verbally asked to get her luggage. I've spoken with customer service about trying to get the full $550 flight reimbursed. They wanted to put her on another Frontier flight Friday that lays over in Denver overnight for 10 hours--which would put her getting to Austin on Saturday, 2 days after her intended arrival. Then they tried to send her to San Antonio on Frontier for a shorter layover time, then pay for a car to drive to Austin, all of this instead of just covering the Delta flight. At that point paying for rental cars and all this they may as well just cover the extra $150 flight on Delta. Bottom line: We lost $150 booking the replacement flight. We may have lost another $103 on the original flight purchase that was cancelled (we'll see if they actually refund that). Parking fees are lost A full day of the trip is wasted, a day of work was missed to sit in an airport from 1pm to 9pm. We will never fly this airline again."

Then make them wait 45 mins while the pilot who is actually flying the plane lands a completely different aircraft on the other side of the terminal and then spends an additional hour doing his paperwork.

The seats are a preformed hard plastic and don't recline. My back is still (after 3 weeks), hurting me. There's no snacks or drinks unless you want to pay $2.99 for a can of soda. And the serving tray is so small. You also pay for your seat. We sat towards the back, so ours were $6.00 each and the same when we changed planes. ($24.00 total). Everyone must of bought the cheap tickets because the pilot came out 3 times saying the ""plane was off balance"" and people had to move around. You can bring only one tiny carry on, which HAS to fit under the seat in front of you and  if you use the overhead storage it's $45.00.  You are so squeezed in together that after 7 hours of flying, your shoulders are in a permanent squeezed position. I'm giving Frontier Airlines a #1 rating, because even though the staff were very kind, and the pilot got us to our destination alive, it doesn't make up for the horrible and I believe unnecessary discomfort."

I’m not going to try to be polite or professional because clearly this airline knows nothing about either. I have traveled over 30 countries and 20 states and have been on hundreds of flights. That being said, never in my entire life have I ever had two worse travel experiences than the only two times I have booked with Frontier. Both times I have had to spend hundreds of dollars out of my pocket to buy a new flight from a different airline because Frontier had canceled the flight without even a 12 hours notice. Not only is the money an issue, but the stress, time, and energy to find a new route within moments notice while trying to check in, has been immense. The employees were of no help, and neither was customer service on the phone. I felt as though the employees did not care about any of the passengers needs at all and only gave responses that would make people leave them alone. I was offered a travel voucher for Frontier, which is absolutely the last thing I would ever want. I will never contemplate buying another ticket with Frontier. I had to spend $498.20 on a new flight this last time, with a very superior and well organized airline, Delta. I highly recommend spending the extra money on a Delta flight first time around. It's worth it. Plus, in circumstances like mine, you're going to be forced to buy a new flight anyways so may as well choose any airline besides Frontier. ""Low fares, done terribly wrong. We are a scam"" should be their new slogan"

I had to wait 30 minutes just to talk to someone about my lost luggage. One of the employees finally came out and said that they would contact me once found. He stated that it probably was taken off the plane during my layover instead of staying on the plane and traveling with my to my finally destination. I got my luggage the next day and was told that I would have received it sooner had the employee written my address down correctly. That night I had no clean clothes for myself or my two year old daughter.

Pretty much the worst. 30 min to drop off bags, website wasn’t working, seats are uncomfortable and don’t recline. Also we left late on both legs. On the way back we sat in the middle of the tarmac for 30 min waiting for a plane to back out of the gate so we could go in. This was also at 12:45am (an hour late). Also their tray tables and seat pockets are so tiny. I’ve flown a tonne and this is by far the absolute worst airline. Definitely worst than spirit. Never again!"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas,September 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Chicago to Las Vegas. Let me start by saying, I have had no issues with trips on Frontier from Chicago to Colorado. Apparently, if going from Chicago to and from Las Vegas, you will experience a trip from hell. On my way out there, my flight was delayed repeatedly. I can't blame Frontier for weather, as it was storming in Chicago, and Sam did everything he could to not only get us rebooked, but feed us and give us travel vouchers for future flights. On my way back was a nightmare. We got checked in at the airport after midnight on a red-eye and from the time it took for us to walk through security to the gate, we arrived at the gate to find out the flight had been cancelled. The way we found out was through an email stating that Frontier was sorry to have to change our plans, but here is $200 in flight vouchers. Our first question was, ""What changes?"" We went into the Frontier app and saw the flight had been cancelled. The airport flight boards had not even been updated. Apparently, everyone scrambled to get rebooked, and the soonest we could get rebooked with no additional costs to us was 2 days later on another red-eye. We were handed letters at the gate letting us know that we had a couple options...rebook on Frontier and they would give us $200 flight vouchers, get a refund on our flight and rebook with Frontier on a later flight and we'd get $200 plus $500 in flight vouchers, or book a flight on a different carrier and they'd reimburse us up to $400 for the flight/rental car expenses, plus give us $200 in flight vouchers. It was Labor Day weekend, so flights on short notice through other carriers were upwards of $800. That is $400 more than I would get reimbursed by Frontier, so we took the flight on 9/4. A different nightmare involving the Tropicana Hotel commenced after we left the airport, but that is another story. At least we had the forethought to book a hotel room to cover us through when the next flight left Tuesday morning, in case this one was also cancelled. That flight started out much like the other one: delayed from 12:59 AM to 2:10 AM. At least this time, we stayed in our hotel until we absolutely had to go to the airport. We ended up sitting at the airport for about an hour before the flight eventually left at 2:15 AM. I am not surprised about how bad this trip was, as most airlines like Frontier and Spirit are notorious for this kind of run-around, however, I was shocked that we had to call repeatedly to Frontier to find out if they would cover the lodging and food charges we've incurred from having to stay 2 extra days longer than we had intended since they cancelled the flight. The other thing that annoyed me was that in order for us to submit a claim to our credit card company to try to get reimbursed for travel expenses, Frontier would need to supply a letter stating that Mechanical Failure or 1 of 4 other approved reasons were why the flight was cancelled before we could get money back from the trip protection provided on our credit card. We've submitted claims to Frontier to see if we'll get any more money back from them, but I'm not holding my breath. I'll update my review if/when it gets resolved. That said, I haven't put Frontier on my do-not-fly list, due to the ease of at least 4 trips to Colorado, but I definitely won't fly them anywhere but Colorado which is their home base."

I fly 1-3 times per month, using a variety of airlines, and Frontier is the most unprofessional, and unconcerned that they're screwing up regularly. It is not worth it to just to save a few bucks. They are cheap for a reason, and from many experiences, I can almost assure that you'll be disappointed. Again, this is based on my experiences from many different flights I've taken with Frontier (and comparing to many other airlines I fly with regularly)."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to San Francisco,August 2018,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Kansas City to San Francisco. We had a personal emergency the day before our flight and tried to use our travel insurance to cancel the flight. Well, we found out that travel insurance covers things like natural disasters and terrorist attacks, but does not actually enable you to cancel the flight like the marketing suggests. With crazy baggage fees (have to pay for carry on as well as checked bags) our ticket ended up not being the great deal we thought it would be. On top of that, to cancel the flight so they can sell the seat, there's a $99 fee just to give you a small partial credit that has to be used within 90 days. When I called in, customer service was rude, condescending and totally dismissive. Reading from a script - it's like speaking with a robot. Wish I would have read reviews before booking and wasting my money. We have a newborn so we definitely can't afford. Will never fly Frontier."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Austin,August 2018,3.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Our flight was cancelled and the unhelpful employee at the front counter through a piece of paper at me with directions on rebooking with another airline. He offered no help whatsoever. Of course rebooking our flight on another airline cost us 1000 to rebook. They gave us vouchers which only covered 800 of it. So because of them I am out an extra 200 plus dollars. Will never fly them again. Terrible service.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,September 2018,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  Chicago to Orlando. My family's vacation was all screwed up because Frontier kept delaying our flight out from Chicago to Orlando. Happened 3x before they canceled the flight 6hrs prior to departure time. They rebooked us on a flight the next day that literally left us only 10hrs of a stay at our hotel before we had to leave for our cruise. I had to rebook our hotel and car rental because of their canceled flight. Had I booked the flight the day before our cruise and all this happened, we would've missed our entire cruise. Then they give a voucher for $200 pp as an incentive - so I'm looking at flights to Vegas. They only offer a straight flight at 9:30pm or midnight and everything else took 20hrs to get there - like what airline would send you to Boston from Chicago before you fly to Vegas? And 20hrs?!?! I'm only going halfway across the country, not the world. When we arrived at Orlando, one of our luggages didn't make it on our flight because it got mixed up with another one - I go to customer service at MCO and how about this lady told us our luggage will arrive the next day in the evening. At this point, I lost my Jesus because our cruise was the next day and she couldn't do anything about it. Another thing, every airline I've used would have your checked luggage on the belt right where you get your tickets. Not Frontier - you have to walk to a separate area with your luggage. Employees are as dry as can be with the exception of 1 flight attendant. The only positive about my entire experience is the pilot on our way back to Chicago from Orlando - best landing ever and he got us thru a storm."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Myrtle Beach,August 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1," Providence to Myrtle Beach. Had the enjoyable experience of finding out just how little Frontier values there customers this past Labor Day weekend. My return flight from Myrtle Beach to Providence was cancelled (which I see they do all the time) becuase of “enviromental damage” which Frontier explained to me was likely caused from hail. Because that issue was deemed “out of their control” they only gave me two options, reimbursement or rebooking. Rebooking my flight would be fine, but they dont fly often enough so they expected me to stay another two nights away from home before they could get me on a flight. They wouldn’t help me find another non-Frontier flight home, they wouldn’t help me find a place to stay for the two nights, they wouldnt’t help me rent a car so I could get around, they wouldn’t help with anything. The reimbursement option was a joke as well, as I had paid 286.95 for my flight, and they were only willing to give $83 back. Truly pathetic customer service. Never fly with this airline, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. An extra $100 or so is worth it to avoid this mess."

So now I'm sitting in Utah almost 2000 miles from home with no clothes, medicine, hygiene products, dress and shoes for my daughters wedding and my daughters wedding veil. And now trying to reach someone by phone to find my bag is a joke. I wouldn't recommend this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Minneapolis,August 2018,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  Colorado Springs to Minneapolis. We were delayed going to Minneapolis by over 4 hours due to some malfunction on the plane. (I’m thankful they were taking precautions to keep all of us safe.) But then our flight was completely cancelled on the way back with less than 12 hours notice. They didn’t have any other flights going to CO for days! I was forced to use another airline to get home and spent twice as much on a last minute one way ticket as I did on the original round trip ticket with Frontier. I was not impressed. Saving a few bucks on my original ticket ended up causing me a lot. Live and learn I guess. Another thing that should be noted is their “trip protection”. In May of this year I booked tickets for my mom and dad to come to town for the birth of my son. I brought trip protection in case baby decided to come early. At the time my husband was deployed and I had 4 other small children at home, so it was important and necessary for my parents to be there to help me out. I ended up needing them earlier but I found out that the trip protection offered (that I purchased!) is only for certain emergencies and apparently helping a deployed spouse give birth is not one of those emergencies. Ridiculous. So I had to buy my parents new tickets and got a very small amount refunded to me for the other tickets."

If you are looking for an airline that will delay/cancel, require you to spend endless hours waiting, to finally put you on a plane, keep you there for a long period, only to have you get off, wait in terminal, then again board, wait more than 30 min on runway, with no compensation, this is the airline for you! My all in delay time was 14 hours! While I watched all other airlines have zero issues leaving the airport. Only positive: the overwhelmed staff were super friendly despite the barrage of upset passenger's."
Not Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Las Vegas,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Omaha to Las Vegas. This trip to Vegas was booked months in advance (it would of been my first time there.) The day of the flight, we arrived 2 hours prior, had our baggage fees already paid (did so the day before on the app), we checked our luggage and went on our way through security, to the gate. The plane arrived on time to take us, those passengers de-boarded rather quickly and before I knew it, it was time to board. Which is a pretty quick process. Everyone got on, they did the usual security and safety stuff. We belted up, and the plane moved backwards about 15 feet. And stopped. We then find out there's an issue. So we wait, and wait. After about 45 mins were all asked to de board, and take our stuff. Never a good sign. We then wait again. About 2 hours. Flight cancelled. We are now responsible for re booking on another airline, and they will ""refund"" us up to $400.00. What? Last minute tickets were over $800 a piece. Really? So we were spending an additional $800, after refund, for a trip we already paid for. We also had the option to be fully refunded - and cancel our trip. Seeing as we couldn't get out of Omaha to Vegas for the next few days, and only had 4 days for this trip due to work schedules, we opted to cancel. Super disappointing. But really? These are you only options? How about re-booking your customers at your cost? None of us were late for the flight. None of us caused the plane issues. We were all in accordance of your policies. But we get punished by having to spend even more? What about the kids flying solo? What happened to them? I'm not even upset there was an issue with the plane. Things happen, I get it. What i'm upset with is the absolute lack of integrity and customer service. Once the flight was cancelled, it seemed Frontier washed their hands of us. The ""It's not my problem"" attitude from all levels is disgusting to me. We had to go out of our way to get our money back. Why isn't this done immediately? We took the time to fill out all forms online and submit them, it wasn't until someone, with Frontier, responded back to our FB message. (YES! FaceBook message - as you can not get anyone on the phone) with a response on our next steps - and this was 6-7 days later. You have to beg them for your money back, but they had no issues taking it right away when booking, or paying the ridiculous checked bag and carry on fees. We also received $500 in vouchers a piece that I could care less about since we wont use them, but they act like that's a gift from them to us. I've had flights cancel on other airlines before, but never have I had an experience like this. Hey Frontier, here's some advise, if this is how you're going to do business and how you're going to treat people, put a disclaimer on your website that if the flight cancels we are responsible for re-booking at our cost. Reading these reviews, its a very common thing. I won't fly Frontier again. And I still haven't been to Vegas, as I used all my vacation time for this trip, just to see the inside of the airport, that's in the same town I live in. Thanks for nothing Frontier."

If you enjoy being nickle and dimed to death, this is the airline for you. You pay for everything beyond the right to sit in the most uncomfortable seat imaginable. Pre-selecting a seat, carry-on bag, checked bag, any kind of food or drink (except tap water) all require an extra fee. And God forbid you should decide to choose a seat or bring a bag after you book, you get the great privilege of paying extra. Strangely enough, at least for my flight, it was cheaper to check a bag than bring a carry-on bag.The closer you are to the plane, the more you pay. If you want one of the ""stretchy"" seats you pay $20 when you book, $25 after you book, and $50 once you're on the plane. I'm only 5' tall and I've never before felt that I needed more legroom until my flight on Frontier. My experience was so bad that for my return flight, I'm considering booking on a different airline even though it will cost more even after adding in the fees. The customer service wasn't too bad. But nothing else is worth a nickle."

Not worth in stress what you think you may be saving. First time with Frontier ""Front Me More"". I was so excited to get a direct flight RT so cheap, but was not worth it, in deceptive $$ grab, time wasted, and sheer rudeness of Frontier ""Front Me More"" airline personnel. Wow, you get no carry-on. And there are Third Reich measurements for your one allotted personal item (it has to be kid sized backpack). When you try to Check in 24 hrs in advance with actual seat assignment they charge you. There are no options for free seat assignments on the pick a seat menu, they didn't appear until a few hours before flight time. When you go to the application it keeps saying application needs more info and it repopulates to: 1) Bundle and pay $$ + 2) Pick seat for $12 or $18 + 3) Carry-on for $30+. Stressful. And when I finally was able to get a seat number and tried to save the boarding pass as a PDF (they don't email it like the other airlines) the PDF barcode was jacked up. When I got to security line I tried to regenerate it with a clear barcode. and you guessed it, right back to Front me some more $$ application. Had to go back to Frontier Front Me More Money counter because of the boarding pass issue. More stress and rudeness. Non-stop was supposed to leave at 7 am and since it was the first flight in the morning you would think it would be on time. Wrong again. Front Me More tells all passengers to board over half hour before scheduled flight time (0630) plane late to depart yet another hour (8 am). Do a Layover through a different more reliable airline. A 7 am direct flight of 2 hrs and 15 minutes, when you add 30 minutes sitting on closed doors and forced boarding (06.30) and another hour stuck on plane delay to scheduled time (8 am) that is almost 4 hours total. No time savings from the other airlines with Dallas layover. Check the Travel sites. Frontier sucks at reliable departures. That along with rude Airline personnel and deceptive online money grabs and 24 hour Check in practices are why Frontier should be renamed ""Front Me More"" ($$, Rudeness, Time)."

With the understanding that this would be an ""economy"" experience, I took my first (and last) flight on Frontier airlines. While I expected less leg room and not much by the way of entertainment, my experience was damaged by inconvenient booking, the barrage of ""nickel and dime"" expenses, and the disregard for any actual schedule. While booking my flight online, I had to call Frontier as it would not allow me to purchase a ticket with a connecting flight to SLC that did not require sleeping in the airport overnight. Long story short, after being on hold for 25 minutes, I was told I had to purchase each leg of my flight separately. So, I had to pay twice as much in taxes and fees to avoid an overnight layover, even though a much more convenient layover (1 hour) was available. From the time I booked my flight I had to navigate through the constant calls to upgrade and spend more. On the flight itself (delayed 45 minutes), the flight attendants were terse at best, drily suggesting to the packed flight that an exit row seat could be available for a $50 upgrade. During the flight, the flight attendant gave a loud, ""hard-sell"" pitch for a Frontier credit card that lasted at least 20 excruciating minutes. This was a late-night flight with crying babies trying to rest, and the sales pitch was simply unbearable. I felt like was trapped in a timeshare sales event. Knowing I could possibly miss my next flight to SLC, I sprinted to the gate and barely got on the plane in time, only for the plane to sit at the gate for 45 minutes. With no time to eat, drink, or use the bathroom, I was hungry, thirsty and uncomfortable. How unfortunate that even a snacks or drinks are several dollars each. While I know Frontier isn't responsible for the two crying babies near me, the large guy ""manspreading"" into my space, or the terrible turbulence, these things, combined with the delays, aggressing selling, and poor service, made for a pretty bad experience."

We flew in to San Diego for a week with a round way ticket and when we were supposed to be flown home the flight was randomly cancelled and we weren’t alerted until two hours before, by which time we had already traveled to the airport to check in. When we went up to check our bag(which cost 75$ to check) and get our boarding passes, they told us the flight was cancelled, not delayed, but cancelled, because of “lightening storms”. Ironically, other planes from different airlines were still flying to the same location the same day and time. How funny! We tried to talk to someone at the front desk and they wouldn’t give us any help. They told us the only options frontier was providing was rebook or refund. The next flight home to Pittsburgh on frontier wasn’t until two days later, they told us. They wouldn’t refund our entire round trip flight, only the “unused portion of our ticket”. They weren’t able to help us get another flight on a different airline and they were not willing to help us in the slightest. It was outrageous. They also weren’t going to pay for us to stay in San Diego another two days. We went to book the flight for Wednesday, two days later, to get home but, who knew, there was no space! They told us we could fly out Thursday instead. We go to book it and there’s not enough space. We are told that our only option is to stay until Friday! An extra four days! Stranded! We had lives to get back to! So what we ended up having to do was by last minute flights on other airlines and it ended up costing us almost an extra four thousand dollars to get home! And they couldn’t even refund our entire ticket. Despicable, and I will never fly them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,August 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Just when I thought it couldn't get worse with this airline, my first official flight with Frontier was from San Diego to Denver. It was delayed 5 hours and not one person was accommodating or helpful while we continue to get the run around as to why we couldn't fly. Flash forward to today, my flight from Denver to San Diego got delayed for over 2 hrs and then cancelled. There was no compensation due the plane being struck by lightening. I was forced to pay $460 to book another airline just so I could get home to my son. The next available flight...2 days away. I will never use Frontier again!"

Have flown the first 2 legs of my trip today and my first time on Frontier. Both of my flights were on time and serviced as promised. Yes they nickel and dime you for extras but if you don’t need them, why pay for them? I am very pleased so far. I have 2 more trips on Frontier within the next month. I will review those too for consistency."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Francisco,August 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Las Vegas to San Francisco. This is the worst airline experience i ever had. My flight time was 12.15 pm but I am still in the flight waiting. The pilot says they have no idea about the delay it can be 6 - 8 hrs. Worst is that they made us sit inside the airline for more than an hour now. The staff and very rude anddont even provide food and water. They are charging for water even after delaying the flight for so many hours. The ac was not working properly so the pilot says close down your window shade and rest coz the temperatures are 107 degree outside. They didn't lower the ac temperatures. Bottomline is we are still waiting for our flight to take off as I am writing this review.  Just now they announced that passengers should take another flight and they have no idea when they will fly. Attached are some pictures of passengers leaving the flight.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Denver,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," We had a fight booked from San Jose to Denver on June 28, 2018, due to depart at 11.08am. On the morning of the flight we were sent a message that the flight was delayed by several hours. When we did arrive at the airport, we were then told the flight had been cancelled and that Frontier had no plans to fly that route now for 3 days. Counter staff were not very helpful, directing us to a 1800 number, where the menus offered did not match our circumstances. Eventually we were given a printed sheet that said the airline would offer us a refund or $400 per person towards the cost of an alternate flight with another airline for the same route within 24 hours. Eventually we were able to secure seats on SouthWest Airlines for a flight 5 hours later. I submitted the request for refund on 9 July, which was acknowledged by an Auto-response giving me a Reference number and promising a follow up email as well as a check for reimbursement to be mailed within 30 days. So far I have heard nothing by email or post. As it is very difficult to find a number to call, I posted a request on the FlyFrontier page on 15 August and still have had no response."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Orlando to Las Vegas. Horrible airline! They canceled my flight without emailing us. We get to the airport and the next flight is in 48 hours. No help trying to reroute you because an employee told me they are a discounted airline so have no obligation to reroute or provide hotel stay. Supposedly The reason was not controllable because the crew timed out due to the cancellation of prior Colorado Springs flight due to weather. I honestly don’t know what weather could be end of July. Very unreliable. We had to get home so paid $2700. Frontier refunded our original $1000 but still out of pocket $1700. I heard this happens all the time. Try to save money and ends up costing you just as much as first class on a reliable airline

Prices are good but that's about it. The last three flights I've had with them, there has been some issue that warranted a delay. I understand that things happen, but it seems like it's more of the rule rather than the exception here. I'm really broke so I'll more than likely have to deal with their ineptitude another time. If you can afford a slightly more expensive ticket, do it. Avoid Frontier if at all possible."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Houston,August 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1,  Raleigh to Houston. I will never fly Frontier again. I understand there can be difficulties but today was a disaster. Instead of leaving us sitting in the lobby they decided to board all of us onto the plane and leave us sitting for 2 hours. And gave us one excuse after another. Two hours later we arrive at our destination to delayed again. Never again
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Denver,August 2018,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  We had a nonstop flight booked to leave Milwaukee on Aug 10th at 5:30 am and arrive in Denver by 7:07am. After arriving at the airport at least 1.5 hours prior to our departure time (as recommended by Frontier) we received an email alert that our flight was delayed until 8 am. As we slept at the airport, we received another email alerting us that we were awaiting the arrival of a plane from Denver and we would not be leaving until early afternoon. The airline gave each customer a $10 food voucher for 8 hours of our time! Wow! We remained optimistic that the airline was just having a bad day and chalked it up to “better safe than sorry”, and our return flight would be fine. NOT! We were scheduled to leave Denver in August 17th at 8:07 pm, arriving in Milwaukee at 11:28pm. We received the email alert that our flight was delayed after we had already returned our car rental, stranding us at the airport for 5 hours. This time we received a voucher for $15. Fellow passengers shared stories of missed weddings, needing to purchase rental cars as a result of the delay etc.., When we were finally called, the hostess told all of us that if we didn’t Board in 30 minutes, the flight staff would “time out” and the flight would be cancelled; inferring that it would be on us, if the flight got cancelled, adding to everyone’s, already high, stress. I pray that we take off and don’t get cancelled and want to warn everyone. Do not fly Frontier, this seems to be very typical business for them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Minneapolis,August 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to Minneapolis. This airline is a joke. We were three hours late, had to switch planes and they lost my bag. I understand that things may not go smoothly and I was fine until they lost my bag. They cannot even contact MSP to get them to pick up the phone to see if it came in. I am not getting my bag back anytime soon. Going to a wedding and I have nothing. “These things take time”. That is what I was told, a no wonder. Frontier cannot even call Frontier and get someone to answer the phone. What a joke of an airline. Never again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Orlando,August 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I was scheduled to depart from Memphis and arrive in Orlando, and Frontier made my experience hell on earth! I was already dissatisfied that I had to pay for my carry on and on top of that the plane was delayed. I sat at the airport for 3 hours before anyone at Frontier informed us why we were waiting. 2 hours later we were told the flight was canceled! They were completely unprofessional and disorganized. Before the flight was canceled there were Frontier employees walking around, laughing and not doing anything . Once the flight was canceled they all disappeared and only one lady stay to help the hundreds of upset passengers. They said the would send of a voucher which I never received. Lucky I got ahold of someone in corporate who was able to book me another flight with a different airline (Sign of relief). Never will I ever recommend or fly with frontier again. Yes it’s cheap but it is not worth the trouble! Especially if you are pregnant or traveling with small children."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin TX to Portland OR,August 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Austin TX to Portland OR. Like other negative reviews, our flight was cancelled a few hours before departure on our return home. There was no assistance in helping us book another flight other than to tell us we can reschedule for four days later- but with no hotel or car rental fees even if we could manage to extent our stay. We received a letter at the counter that told us we would be reimbursed for $400 per ticket - we had three tickets- but since we’ve returned, we’ve spent several very frustrating hours on the phone with the airline and have gotten nowhere. We spent nearly$1,600 to get home on another airline. We did get $200 vouchers to flight their airline, but seriously, do they think after this experience and their horrible customer service and losing so much money that we’d actually use those vouchers? Their motto: “Low fares done right,” is completely laughable! Do not use this airline! It is the worst airline out there!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Missoula via Denver,August 2018,3.0,4.0,,,,4.0,3,no,2,"  Providence to Missoula via Denver. I had high hopes flying Frontier for our vacation trips from the East Coast to Montana. Our first flight into Denver was uneventful and we were pleased with our decision. My next flight going from Denver to Missoula was 2 hours late due to a plane not arriving on time. My flight from Missoula back to RI was delayed then cancelled until 2 days later. Then, that next flight was delayed 4 hours and ultimately cancelled until the following morning. I received a $200 voucher (very nice) and I did fly out the next morning (again, mechanical issues). My family then had another trip planned west. Due to leave RI at 11:30am, we didn't leave until 6pm that night and we were delayed in Denver for almost 24 hours as our connection left about 4 hours before we arrived. We each received $200 vouchers again. Now I have $800 in vouchers, but our travel is over for the year and although customer service in Denver told me they were transferable, alas, they are not. Nice gesture, but totally unusable for us. Sadly, we will not be choosing to fly with Frontier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Trenton,August 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My experience with Frontier was far more than disappointing, unprofessional, distasteful, and uncompassionate. Both my departing and return flight had well over 6 hour delays that left ultimately my return flight to be cancelled. I was not provided enough time to properly identify another flight that would allow me to make work, pick up my children, or even save me from spending revenue I had no intentions on spending. The voucher provided to inconvenienced flyers did not cover airfare, travel by cab, parking compensation, and hotel which should have all been taken care of by frontier. My extensive delay for my departing flight lead me to not only have to stay out of town longer because I missed a business meeting but it also caused me to lose out on a major business deal - Which I was not efficiently compensated for. I spent almost 700 additional dollars in hotels and 300 extra in a car rental while Frontier only provided close to a $250 credit. Trying to get a hold of someone in customer service on the phone is a joke and the Frontier workers lack knowledge and are extremely unprofessional. I will never fly frontier again!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Orlando,August 2018,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  The original flight 982 to Orlando, Fl was to depart Memphis, TN at 1150am. Yet we are still here waiting to depart and it is 3:00pm. I received the following departure notification changes of 12:55 pm, 1:35pm, 2:10pm, 2:45pm and now 3:30pm. Not only is this an inconvenience to me but I'm also traveling with an infant. Everyone knows how fussy a child can be especially waiting all day. I have spoken with one customer service agent and was informed if the flight is delayed due to mechanical issues we (everyone) on the flight would be refunded and continue with the flight since we were already checked in. Now I speak with another agent and I was told that information isn't true. They all need to be on the same program of information and they should have another airplane available to put the passengers on. I will never fly Frontier again and I will not recommend this airline to anyone. This is totally unacceptable. No backup planes and the next flight to Orlando is tomorrow. I will pay the extra expenses to avoid this."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland OR to Denver CO,August 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Horrible, horrible airline. I should've listened when friends told me not to fly with them. Will NOT be making that mistake again. My friend and I are flying to see another friend in CO. I paid for first class seating immediately next to each other. Then two hours before our flight (which is at midnight) they just decided to cancel. Either $500 in flight vouchers (like I'd ever want to fly with them again) or we had to get on a cheesy, slow website to book our own tickets out, and they will send us a check for up to $400 for the cost. Because so many people were trying to get their flights it was a scramble to get one before it booked out. Now my friend and I arent even on the same flight, and are arriving at completely different times. We didn't even get the worst of it. An elderly lady got stranded due to their apathy and selfishness, since she couldn't afford the $400 upfront and was thousands of miles away from home."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Reno via Denver,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Washington to Reno via Denver. They cancelled my flight a few hours prior to departure and would not protect me on another airline. Their next flight was 2 days later, so that wasn't an option. (They said they don't have an agreement with any other airline.) So my last minute booking on another airline cost me an extra $300 and I got home 6 hours later. Was travelling with a new puppy, which made it more difficult for me. My careful planning was for naught. They were uncaring to boot. Never again."

I had a flight from Denver, CO to San Francisco, CA before heading to Thailand. My flight to San Francisco was delayed because of lack of cabin crew which they had to fly in  from another state. Because of this, I missed my flight to Thailand and had to purchase another ticket. First off, I called once and the woman said they could issue a voucher, but I had to go to the ticket counter. At this point I was going to security to go to my new flight abroad. Upon arriving to the ticket counter at SFO, the manager told me I needed to call again to get approval. On this call, she informed me I could only get a $50 travel voucher because my flight was only delayed a minute when it was really delayed an hour!! Don’t fly with them! It’s worth paying more to travel with more comfort and deal with nicer people who probably don’t hate their jobs."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Trenton,August 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,2," Charleston to Trenton. First time flying with this airline and it will be our last. Our flight had a few delays - first was 30 minutes because the arriving flight was delayed then another 30 minutes because they wouldn’t allow a customer to fly with his medically supplied breathing machine (he flew to CHS from TTN via Frontier and now they are denying him). Once we were finally on board we sat on the plane for an hour and a half while they repaired a hinge on a water door. After complaining about the wait on the plane and most passengers were hungry they finally gave us one free granola bar to eat. This airline has no complimentary snacks or drinks. We finally arrived 2 hours late. I had to cancel my rental car because they closed before I could get there. Had to use a vehicle not roomy enough for a family of 5 for an eight drive the next morning. They only offered $25 off on my next flight. Also the seats have no padding compared to other airlines and they charge for carry on luggage. Also, our return flight home was delayed by 30 minutes. Never again will I use this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Phoenix,August 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,3,"  Washington to Phoenix. By far the worst airline, not only is the aircraft older but the flight attendants even though the uniform is very posh/professional they have bad attitudes. One customer asked for a blanket, the attendant was rude and answered very quickly ""we don't have blankets"" not unfortunately, I am sorry we don't have blankets-- mind you this is after a 2 hour boarding delay full of drama! The incoming flight that got off the plane had all kind of drama causing my flight boarding delay and the previous pilot got off that plane with a stressed out appearance! There was no order of conduct with boarding and the lady that announced the boarding detail was foreign and hard to understand. I was on a straight flight to Phoenix however the plane stopped in Denver to pick up more people and I stayed on the plane the attendants were rude and rushing; I could barely get to the restroom. This airline is outdated, no internet, no inflight entertainment, no snacks free of charge, unfriendly, uncomfortable, dirty. I would not recommend them, I would suggest spending a few more dollars for a piece of mind. This was also my children first experience flying I will never pay for tickets and fly with this airline again."

The money involved in the flight was not the only loss. I'm missing a friend's departure completely. The manager was unsympathetic and unaccommodating. Frontier was the only airline to choose not to fly out due to weather on the east coast and they still refused to pay to transfer the passengers with immediate needs to Americans Airlines, which had seats available. Some of the other passengers had to be at work tomorrow, while one woman was hosting an entire conference tomorrow night. The soonest they offered to get us there was Wednesday, flying out from other states. Do not fly with this airline. They do not have the connections to help you get from one place to another when their airline falls short. I've cancelled all of my plans, some without refunds, and filled out this review, all while on hold with Frontier's customer service."

We landed in Austin, TX 10 minutes after the scheduled departure time for the second leg of the flight (also with Frontier Airlines). We were 10 passengers. Frontier Airlines did not wait for us. The next available flight out of Austin to San Jose was four (4) days later. All the other flights were full so they could not confirm us for earlier flights. We had no choice but to but to spend night at Austin, Tx and buy tickets with other airline the next day. Frontier will not compensate us for the hotel or other airline and they expected us to stay in Austin at our expense for four days. If you are retired and have money to spend on hotel/motel then go with Frontier. They will depart from the ""origin"" but will there is no guarantee that you will reach your destination in time."

Worst airline ever -  avoid flying with Frontier, I have flown with a lot of airlines and Frontier has to be the worst, Spirit is even better than Frontier. On a recent trip Frontier managed to lose both our car seats on both flights from Denver to Sacramento and back again. ""How do you lose car seats I asked the baggage attendant"" her response, ""Well they are just another bag."" You tell that to a 4 and 5 year old at 2:00 in the morning, when we should have had them 3 hours earlier. I know Frontier is cheaper, but you get what you pay for, fly with another airline."

After being on hold for an hour and half I was told that the next flight wasn’t going to be until Thursday (my flight was Monday). I then had to speak to a supervisor because the first agent didn’t help at all. I was put on another flight the next day and that flight was late. I got no reimbursement even though I was out of work for a day. Please do yourselves a favor and never expect that frontier will make it right when they screw you out of a flight home.

Frontier Airline is the most disgusting and unprofessional airline of them all I'm convinced. After having our flight delayed minutes before we were scheduled to board and after waiting 2 hours, we learned our flight has been canceled. Their refund policies are horrible and cover little to nothing when it comes to booking another flight. If I were you, I'd stay far away from Frontier as my family and I are not the only ones to have endured this. Also their staff is extremely unprofessional and don't even pretend to be interested in helping you figure out your issue. As I stated before, please avoid this airline. It'll save you a lot of time, money and energy."

Awful experience first our flight got delayed for more than 2 hours, when we finally got to board plane as soon as we got in the flight attendants had awful attitudes towards people asking questions, but what was really the worst part was the fact that every time the bathroom door was open a nasty smell would take over the whole plane. When we finally arrived 2 of the flight attendants were by the door covering their noses because they couldn’t handle the smell either."

I don’t usually leave bad reviews, but this experience was so terrible and the customer service was so bad that I want people to know before making the mistake of booking a flight with Frontier. First, we arrived to airport and checked our bags in through the kiosk. No signs saying that if you check in at a certain time you can’t check in your bags, nothing on the kiosk saying that either. They just charge you for the check in and then tell you at the counter you missed the cut off to check bags on. The staff wont make note, even if you complain that the airline allowed you to pay the additional charge knowing you missed the cut off. Then when you call customer service they tell you they can’t refund your money for the charge because you checked them in at the kiosk and the attendant didn’t make note of it.  Also, the staff on the plane was rude. It was an early flight but they all had attitudes and at this point we weren’t upset because we hadn’t realized our money would not be refunded for the bag check. We missed the cut off by 2 minutes waiting in line. The plane was freezing and the snacks that you pay for are less then adequate. The only reason we were booked on this flight was because we bought a package vacation and I figured I would give the airline a chance, even though I had not heard of it."

My wife and I were flying out to Vegas for my 29th birthday party, and we had flight vouchers through Frontier. We had these vouchers as the last time we fly Frontier our flight was canceled. Different day, same story. Our Friday night flight to Vegas (through Denver) was delayed to the point that our connection would be missed. At the terminal, the worker specifically told us we could receive a refund. This was a blatant lie as after the trip customer service would only allow us to receive another voucher (why would I ever want to use this). Due to the delayed flight, our options were to 1. Fly on the delayed flight, spend the night in Denver, and then fly out of Denver on Saturday at 10 pm. 2. Wait until Sunday to fly (uh, no), or receive a refund. None of these options worked as we already had hotels booked in Vegas. So, we had to purchase tickets for the next day through a new airline. Long story short, Frontiers horrible reliability and terrible customer service cost us $1,150 as we had to purchase tickets through a new airline. This is a terrible airline, a terrible company, and a terrible choice in travel."

They just had people sitting there for hours waiting! Also, why would they not have a crew? And if they knew they’d need a new crew, why weren’t they called in advance? Frontier is cheap for a reason! I wasn’t too happy that my 16 year old waited in an airport by herself for 6 hours!!"

Don’t get me started about the hidden fees (want you’re seat to recline? $45 extra). I read the bad reviews before flying with them and thought “I want to experience it myself because the flight was a decent price”. Pay extra and fly else where! I there’s one review you take to heart, it’s this one."

Dirty planes, bathrooms filthy if they are working. I had to clean my tray of dried food. Delays, delays, and you finally arrive and you have to wait on the runway because they can only afford one gate in Tulsa and that plane in gate is delayed, so we had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes. They don’t care. The steward just said “oh well call frontier”. Great way to treat your passengers!!!"

This was the first and last time I will ever fly on this airline. Four hour delay on my first flight and 2.5 hour delay on my return trip. I've been waiting over 30mins for my bags.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Austin,July 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This is a formal complaint against Frontier Airlines. We have never experienced such a disrespectful disregard as customers in all the years we have been traveling. On our return flight from Reno to Austin, our bag was lost. No one from Frontier seemed to care. The girl that does the baggage in the Austin airport was so ditzy that she ignored me when I asked her questions. The only breath of fresh air was a guy who at least took the time to call the Reno airport to find our bag as well as double check the plane. Anybody we talked to on the phone couldn't be bothered that our bag was lost. As of right now, our bag has been found but not with Frontier airlines. It was found with another airline. Our bag had no tags or stickers indicating that it was with Frontier, so the only assumption we have is that the ticket agent in the Reno airport never put a tag or sticker indicating where the bag needs to go. So because of his mistake, Frontier lost our bag. And to this today, right now, 08/06/2018 at 2:08 pm, no one from Frontier has bothered to call us about our missing bag, no one has bothered to check-in with us about our missing bag. Frontier has lost my husband and I as customers. We will never fly Frontier again. And I will make it a priority to shame Frontier airlines every chance I get."

Had to pay for 38 dollars for a carry on and a checked bag each plus to select seats was an additional 12 per person. Overall ended up paying about 90.00 more than the original fare. May have been cheaper initially but by the time you add on these items it would be best to check other options. In addition, we had to check our bags but when you arrive at the airport in La Guardia the counter does not open until 7am no matter what time your flight is in the morning. Makes no sense to arrive early to stand in line to check our bags for a min of 30 minutes then you still have to go to TSA. Will personally not fly Frontier ever again, too much stress and headaches associated with this airlines. Cheap fares but high cost of addons."

Booked my family’s vacation months in advance and only a couple weeks after, my return flight was canceled so it had to be rescheduled for a day earlier. Fine - I can deal with that. But then only a couple hours before we were to return that flight was also canceled! Frontier’s options were a full refund or take the next flight 3 days later. Well we don’t have a life of leisure and have an extra 3 days as we actually have to go to work. So, now we’re stuck paying hundreds of dollars in a rental car to drive from FL to NJ with 2 young children. I will definitely not fly with Frontier again."

Every time, my flight is delayed. Last flight was delayed 5 hours. Currently sitting at the terminal as we should have boarded the flight 30 minutes ago. There are no updates from the staff. They couldn't care less. The interior of the plane has had so many shortcuts done to it: small, uncomfortable seat, trays that are so small, they’re completely pointless, snacks are skimp. The only good thing with Frontier is that they’re cheap. You get what you pay for. I’ll spend the extra money to have a decent flight. I’m never flying Frontier again. "

The seats are uncomfortable, and flights are always delay causing a big inconvenience in our travel plans. I do not recomend it specially if you have connecting flights (because of delays), they charge for absolutely everything (your seat, water and what not). Next time I'll choose another airline even if I have to pay a little bit more. We are not going to use vouchers the airline gave us because they are not reliable."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Indianapolis,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I flew with Frontier several years ago and had a great experience. The flight prices were cheaper, but I don't remember feeling unsatisfied after my flights. Apparently the quality and customer assistance have gone way downhill in the past few years. My husband and I flew from Indianapolis to Las Vegas. The flight was fine, however, they nickel and dime you for every little thing, including water. The on-board flight staff were rude - one even yelling at a young child flying unaccompanied to ""clean up her mess"" and that ""she does not operate as a maid service"". The child had spilled some of her snack on the floor. She also had not parents to defend her. The flight attendant in question thought she was quite funny, making jokes the remainder of the flight, but I would like to say that her yelling at a young, unaccompanied minor was far from funny. The seats are uncomfortable and do not recline. There is no in-flight entertainment, which is fine. We were anticipating flying out the following week from Las Vegas, however, our flight was unexpectedly canceled only a couple hours before boarding time. No explanation was ever given as to why the flight was cancelled. Frontier left and entire plane full of people high and dry. The only 'help' offered was a refund of the flight plus travel vouchers OR up to $400 per person reimbursement for booking a new flight plus a small travel voucher. Sounds great, but honestly, the offer was trash. If you've never tried to book a flight the day of, flight prices are much higher than $400... especially when a plane full of people are all trying to book the same flights. Frontier so kindly offered to fly people out on Monday, but then mentioned that there was only 1 seat left (this occurred on a Saturday morning). At the time, when it became apparent that Frontier was not going to help anyone and people started to get angry, the staff members working the check in and baggages desks walked away and hid. They would not answer questions, they would not offer assistance. Eventually a couple came back out after the angry crowd died down and I was able to get some help. It was cowardly. I will never fly Frontier again, no matter how good the price or the flight times. It was an awful experience and I hope this review can save another person/couple/family from being stranded in an airport with no assistance offered by Frontier."

Customer service is dismal and no one seems to care about us. I’ve been cancelled on my last 3 Frontier flights and ended up sleeping in the airport with no compensation other than a flight 3 days later. My flight is delayed again out of Philly and I have a feeling it will be cancelled as well. Do not fly Frontier, you will just be sad in the end and be left alone in the airport."

Seats uncompfy, no movies, had to pay for soda or water. I could live with this, but on our way back to orlando, the flight landed in Colorado springs and sat on the runway which we could see for an hour. Our flight was to leave at 7 it didn't board til 815ish. When we boarded we sat on the runway for 30 minutes only to turn back to the gate. We were given no explanation except that due to weather our flight was cxld. This was a lie. The pilot purposely sat on the runway to time himself out and blamed the weather so they don't have to compensate anyone. The next flight out of Colorado springs was 5 days later - it was a horrible experience. Do not fly on Frontier ever. I could say more but there isn't enough space for me to continue."

I’m a 20 year old girl I barely make enough to live I don’t have 500 just laying around Frontier I’m very disappointed! They gave me free vouchers? I wouldn’t trust them again.

However when the part arrived they said the part was incorrect part and our flight was cancelled with no flights for 3 days or choose another airline same day and pay more than my whole trip cost for one way tickets. Also major cause for concern plane never moves and we board same plane that supposedly had a defective part at 5am instead of 1.30am."

The last 3 times I've flown with them, they delay the flights by 3-4 hours due to plane maintenance. Today I reached out to the airline customer ""care"" and after literally saying ""there is nothing we are going to do for you"" when I asked for a refund, she also decided to hang up on me when I told her I'd like to speak to a supervisor. The level of disrespect and lack of care for their customers is unacceptable and I will never be flying Frontier again and will share my experiences and warnings to everyone I know. If you dont want to lose customers, you shouldn't treat them like garbage."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Las Vegas,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our first flight to Vegas was delayed for hours. We didn’t fly out of Tennessee until after 10:00 pm. We were supposed to take off at 8:45 pm. There was a loud and obnoxious woman that proceeded to get drunk and kept yelling loudly how upset she was and making vulgar comments. When we finally boarded the plane, they intended to let her fly. They ended up taken her off and she freaked out and caused more of a delay. When we were boarded I has paid a pretty penny to pick my seat, pay for my luggage, and to have priority in loading the plane. That didn’t matter, everyone boarded in front of me that was not with kids or needed help. The same thing happened on my flight back from Vegas to Memphis. Priority is a way for them to get more money and not keep their endof the bargain. There needs to be more flights offered from Frontier to go back and forth from Vegas. It’s one time in three days and an offer of one flight time is ridiculous. I will never fly with Frontier again nor will I share a good review."

Bring your own drinks and food as everything (except water) is a charge. On way home, from Cancun, we were told our personal bags would have to be paid for (Chicago did not make us do). We were told by Cancun personnel ""you can pay or you can't bring back with you"". I spoke to manager who reinforced this information. We were forced to pay $90. I contacted the company and was told ""they do not offer refunds"". Very disappointed. I had checked and measured bags prior to flight. I was hoping for resolution and a refund but it does not seem Frontier Airlines is interested in customer services and satisfaction."

Jennie is only 44, left the hospital against doctors orders and made it to the airport to fly home to Denver. Frontier customer service stepped up and helped her the entire way. They even reduced her bag fee, got me on the phone when her CC didn’t work to pay for it. I thought a positive review was needed. Kudos to the customer service/ticket person who compassionately helped her. Thank you Frontier ... Customer service is key!"

The seats are very uncomfortable, the staff has been nothing but rude and the lack of concern for the schedule people are on to catch other flights is despicable. I will never fly with Frontier Airlines again."

I had a trip planned to Las Vegas and the airline cancelled the flight just hours before we were scheduled to leave. Their reason for cancellation was ""Air Traffic Control"" and they cannot do anything to fix that other than reschedule through their airline. After being on hold for over two hours to solve the problem, they were able to reschedule a flight for the next morning, which was not direct, like our original booking had been. This was still a pathetic ""fix"" to our problem. Upon leaving for the new flight, they cancelled it yet again. Their customer service is absolutely worthless. I will never fly with this airline again, nor will anyone I know. They have taken our money and have given us nothing but false hope, excuses and a lack of respect for the company."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Denver via Las Vegas,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My best friend and I traveled from Denver to Chicago to celebrate her birthday. To return, we booked our plane tickets from Chicago O’Hare to Denver International Airport, with a short layover in Las Vegas, at least three months prior to traveling, and chose Frontier Airlines because of the comparably cheaper flight tickets. But even their cheap tickets won’t ever, ever be enough for me to fly with Frontier again. The first flight from Chicago to Las Vegas was delayed by more than three hours, causing me and my friend traveling with me to miss our connecting flight. While in Chicago, we reached out to Frontier first via their support phone line and then in person at the airport, to ask Frontier what we should do given their delay. We were told that Frontier Airlines could not get us home to Denver for four days, which in itself is unacceptable for an airline to tell a customer trying to get home, and in addition Frontier did not offer us vouchers for hotels or food. Frontier told us to stay in a city away from home without any resources for four more days because they could not offer us any route home. That is simply unacceptable behavior towards paying customers. We ended up purchasing new plane tickets to go home from American Airlines, and an agent representing that airline stayed over an hour past when he got off his shift to help us and 20 other passengers find routes to travel. Oh, and an awful cup of coffee on Frontier is $2.99. Never again."

Last time when I flight from Las Vegas to Cleveland they delayed 10 hours but with notice in advanced and a $100 voucher. Then I decided to use that voucher for this flight from Buffalo to Tampa and it was terrible. The flight was 11:45am in the morning but it was delayed 3 times until 3pm. People were sitting in the airport doing nothing. Then, they surprising canceled the flight with a reason: there’s no cabin crew. They gave me a $10 food voucher and I was asked to go home and wait until 5am in the next morning to catch the flight. This is terrible and there’s no words I can describe it. Don’t ever fly with Frontier!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Denver,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  I was originally scheduled to fly on July 24 at 10:50 pm from Laguardia to Denver. The flight was delayed twice until passed midnight once we were on the plane within 5 minutes they told us that the flight was canceled and we needed to get off the plane. Once we were at the gate, the customer service representatives from Frontier in a very rudely manner explain to us the reasons why the flight was canceled and our options. They passed a letter around all the passengers saying that no hotel accommodation was available through Frontier therefore we need it to find our own hotels and they will reimburse us up to 150USD - but no transportation was going to be provided. If we were not able to find a hotel we needed to ask the Airport personnel to let us stay at the airport since they needed to ""close the airport"". We were aghast with their ""options"", it was 2 am and there was no way we can find a hotel nearby. We were transported back and forth from terminals until 4 am to check in again for our re-schedule flight. We were given a Voucher for food for $15 and a Voucher to flight again with them for 200.00 (which I am NOT planning to use).  It is incredibly sad to see that the only thing Frontier cares for is to charge you for everything (even to choose your own seat) but the least of their worries are the customer."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Las Vegas.  During the check in process we were informed that the flight was cancelled. We were notified via email and text approximately 1.5 hours prior to departure. The airline offered no reasonable alternative flight pursuant to FAA rule 240 to offer alternative transport to our destination within 24 hours. The customer service rep made some vague comments about purchasing tickets and trying for reimbursement. We were then offered a flight out of Tampa into Denver to connect on the morning of 7/24 to Boise, where we would rent a car and drive the remainder. After these tickets were booked, we were informed that the connecting flight was actually scheduled to depart the night of 7/24. Since this would not work we made arrangements to fly to Salt Lake City the morning of 7/24. This change cost us over a thousand dollars of unnecessary expenses and included spending the night on the floor at the Denver international airport with our three children. Upon boarding the flight on 7/24 we remained at the gate until approximately 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time. At that time we were deplaned due to maintenance issues. I feel that the extremely poor management of this airline is directly what led to these issues and left my family to spend large sums of time and money to make up for Frontiers obvious inability to run a functioning airline. The airport is literally full of people that have been left delayed and/or stranded by this airline. This sort of treatment is wholly unacceptable and needs to be addressed."

There are not even words for how terrible this experience has been. Our first flight got cancelled with no explanation. We were told the only option we had was to drive 2 hours to Tampa to catch another flight or wait 3 days for the next flight. Absolutely insane! They refused to refund us or put us on another airline or even give us food vouchers or a rental car. Got to Tampa, waited 6 hours for a flight. Got stuck in Denver for 11 hours with no accommodation. Got put on a flight to Salt Lake City (mind you we are traveling to California which means best case scenario they’re forcing us to make a 9 hour drive). Got on the plane and then they made everyone deboard and now we are delayed again. We’re going on 2 full days stuck in Denver with 3 kids. No food vouchers. No refunds. No explanations. Nothing. They have completely ruined our family vacation and we still have the return trip to worry about which I assume will be just as terrible. Somebody needs to do something about this airline. It’s absolutely not ok."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to New York,April 2018,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Frontier Airlines is such a disappointment. Let’s start off with how bad traffic was getting to LAX. Then arrived on time to check into my flight just to be told my flight was canceled. I was shocked and devastated! Frontier Airlines did not send notifications or emails out informing their travelers their flight was canceled. They offered three other options to accommodate for their letdown. I decided to take another flight couple days later. But going through the trouble of organizing my life & preparing for my trip just to be told it was canceled without any warning was pretty shitty.  Now I understand why somany people complain about Frontier Airlines. Their fares maybe appealing, but their services are a huge catastrophe. Not to mention their airplanes lack WiFi service and the large carry-on fee they charge && lots of delays, which are long & also you find out at the last minute your flight will be delayed. If you can avoid flying with Frontier please do. I will certainly will."

(I am writing this on behalf of my granddaughter since she is a minor still stranded in Chicago) They canceled my granddaughter's flight home to Phoenix today from Chicago. She was going as an unaccompanied minor so they charge a lot to have someone make sure she gets on the flight safe and gets handed off to an approved person after landing. No phone call from Frontier to make arrangements to book her on a later flight, and there were open seats on flights later in the week. No one answered the customer service number for an entire day. Finally my oldest son drove to O'Hare to confront them. They refused to do anything other than reimburse 50% of her round trip ticket which they'll send in a week or two (maybe). Do you know how much it costs for a last minute ticket home which her parents now get stuck paying for since Frontier refused to get her home?! This is unprofessional, such poor customer service. Other airlines at least book you on a later flight and if they can't accommodate they book you on another airline with no extra charge. And this is not the first time this has happened to someone I know with Frontier. It's infuriating! How could Frontier Airlines strand a child and then say, oh well, your problem. "

My flight was cancelled the morning of departure. Leaving me with no options to fly home to work until Friday (4 days after my original flight). I was supposed to be back in Tampa 7/23 at 10:17am to make it to interpret for a client at a court hearing and meetings throughout the day. Instead, I was stuck in Frontier’s line for over an hour and on the phone for over another hour and forty-five minutes to try and remedy the issue. After a supervisor was put on the phone, my options were; (1) Rescheduled at no additional cost OR (2) Refund with no voucher. This feels like a slap in the face! Considering what I had gone through with Frontier all day and I am currently without a flight home. I am an elite member and almost always booked my flights with Frontier. I rely heavily on Frontier to get me to and from where I need to be if I’m giving Frontier my time, trust and money. I understand that while weather, mechanical and other situations may occur, I can’t wrap my mind around why it would take 4 days to get me home. My car is parked at the Tampa Airport and will be accruing charges. I am missing out on a full day of work today (and possibly 3 more days to come), can’t make money, incurring extra charges at the airport and paying extra for kennel/dog babysitting fees. This does not factor in the fact that I am now unreliable to my client and pets. After today, if Frontier truly wants my business and values their company - I hope they really pull through and let me and everyone who had to encounter what I went through today know how it’s reasonable that we’d have to wait 4 days for an available flight to get us home. I feel that Frontier does not value my time and business. This is absolutely horrendous."

I asked if they could give us food vouchers because at this point we had been at the airport for 5 hours. I asked if they could give us accommodation vouchers and yup, they said no!

They offered us a flight on Thursday (this was a Monday). No apologies to us. I haven’t seen my dad in 3 years and this time with him was priceless, not to mention the $3000 in hotel fees. They cancelled the flight the night before and NEVER notified us. We would have started driving if they had. Frontier completely ruined our trip! I will never ever fly with them. Not to mention they try to double charge you for the seats with $17-25 to preassign your seats and the extra bag charges including $60 charge for a carryon. The worst customer service ever!

I realize they can’t get flights out on time they don’t communicate with customers and make excuses of why the are delayed 2 hours but don’t leave until 5 hours after the original flight time.  The ticket counter and gate people just run away and don’t make eye contact when your trying to get answers and then they don’t even try to make it right. Then finally after boarding we sit on the ramp for over an hour with them saying computer problems. This airline is a complete joke

I use Frontier for niche seasonal flights and never have any issues. Ticket cost, carry on and seat selection I tally it all up. The extended leg room is good and is a help with longer flights. No Wi-Fi I can live with and the drink snacks selection is good. I don't compare them to other airlines all I ask is safe travels and good attempts to stay on schedule while keeping travel cost down. I can't fault them they aren't as horrible as some say IMO."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Las Vegas,July 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  San Jose to Las Vegas. I had a flight today and I got left out. I reached the gate when the status was ""boarding"" but the door was closed and I was not let in. I did not receive any phone calls or message despite coming to the airport before 2 hours. Also I was not booked an alternate ticket for tomorrow. I have been calling the customer support but no one responds. I was spoken to very rudely by staff at the gates. And not given alternate tickets when I asked for a feedback form to explain the whole situation. I am very disappointed by the whole incident. Now I have booked another ticket for 300$ and frontier won't refund me or book an alternate flight for me. Please help."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Cincinnati,July 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Cincinnati. Was doing a one way flight from Dallas to Cincinnati with Frontier Airlines. I work in the Aviation Profession. Got to airport early to get boarding passes printed. No ticket agent available to check in. Kiosk would not let me check in, it said to see the ticket agent. Had agent paged several times, no one came, not even after the flight had left. 8 Passengers missed the flight. Corporate hung the phone call up on one passenger said it was not there fault. One passenger was told that it would be a $100.00 fee to change to the next flight, by the way this is Sunday and that flight is Tuesday. One little print 8.5 x 11 printed paper behind one of the isle signs says that the ticket agent leaves 45 minutes prior to departure time, to check everyone in on the flight. This was not visible to the public till you walk away from the counter. This is a cheap airline that doesn't care about the customer at all. The CS airport people and other airline agents say they see this all the time at Dallas DFW. The Airline could at least refund the price of the tickets. Review the tv cameras!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Denver via Austin,July 2018,1.0,4.0,,,,2.0,5,yes,6,"  I checked into my flight via the app with no issue and it had my boarding pass in the app so I could skip the ticket counter and kiosks at the airport. I also paid for a carry on bag in advance. Before leaving my house, the flight was delayed for 2 hours, although the aircraft that was going to be used for this flight was on time and en route in another flight, so that confused me. At the gate, we started the boarding process (I was zone 1 since I had a bag), and we were held on the jetway for a few min because they were not ready to let us into the plane yet. I found this odd we eventually got on. Seats were very uncomfortable and could not recline. Legroom was tight. Cabin staff was very friendly. The plane was further delayed for about 30 min due to a mechanical issue but that got fixed quickly. Eventually we got to Austin and then continued to Denver about two hours late. If you do the research online (bag fees, what’s included etc.) On their website BEFORE you book and head to the airport, you will know what you are in for. Most flyers do not plan ahead of time. Most people flying this airline are first time or occasional flyers expecting a first class experience. You still won’t experience this on main line carriers either. Being said, you get what you pay for, but frontier was upfront on their policies on their website. It got be from point A to B without any major issues. Good for solo traveler like myself. Also another tip, you have to pay for food and drinks from the beverage cart. It’s not too expensive but just bring your own food onboard and fill up a water bottle at a water fountain in the airport. Just do some simple planning ahead and suck up the no frills experience. Literary all of these complaints on this website are because you have to bring a bag and pay for seats. Go fly a mainline carrier then, they’re not much better."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,July 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,2.0,2,no,2,"  Indianapolis to Orlando. This was my first experience with Frontier and I have to say that I was not impressed. My flight going to Indianapolis was fine, no hitches. Nothing spectacular happened, the kiosk to self-check in was unavailable and there were no snacks/drinks, and you have to pay for carry-ons. Sure, it's a cheap ticket. My problem is how they dealt with my returning flight to Orlando. In that it didn't happen. They ended up sending an email probably near an hour before the flight was set to board and we were all checked in. They apologize but flight's been cancelled. Okay, sometimes that happens (though not in such a discrete manner...with rumors about relocating our flight because of stranded individuals for Las Vegas that they cancelled the day before OR that everyone was alerted over the announcements from an employee who prefaced by saying ""Don't no one come up to yell at me but..."") and they'll accommodate for our inconvenience. Lo and behold, they will only reimburse max of $400 per ticket bought from another airline. Cheapest flights that day? $423. For flights that would take longer due to not being direct like the cancelled flight, and wouldn't go out until later that day. We have to pay for new tickets on the spot. Well fine, let's deal with the reimbursement online form. Oh, it doesn't work, it errors out twice for me on Chrome. Let's call customer service: No options for questions and concerns. Okay...let's ask the employee on site: ""We gotta deal with getting this plane out first""  I didn't even ask yet, just came up but alright. The lady nearby that he was talking to turned to me. She was nice enough, gave me a number (same one) and said to do the Feedback option. Weird but okay. After a good bit of waiting on hold, I get someone who doesn't understand me clearly maybe because of the noise in the airport? Sure. Repeat myself and get put on hold a couple times, once because he thought I was cancelling my own flight and looking to rebook on Frontier. ""Can you wait two days? That's the next one we have."" ""I'm sorry, no, we already got our new Delta tickets, I just want to get reimbursed and see if we can have the entire tickets reimbursed not just the 400 max."" After awhile of re-clarifying, he realizes what I'm asking and confirms. ""I will get my tickets completely reimbursed? The entire 423 each?"" ""Yes, ma'am, yes"" ""And I'll get the 200 vouchers as well?"" ""Yes"" ""Good, thank you very much"" He also let me know that I should try another browser instead of chrome to not error out. Cool. So I re-do my reimbursement application while also adding onto the pictures of papers I send that I spoke to an agent who told me that I will get reimbursed the full amount along with the vouchers. Get a confirmation email that it's gone through. Near two weeks later: checks for 400 each, no vouchers in sight. Boyfriend tries to deal with them (he's more of a principled hothead), goes up superiors, .but gets nowhere with all refusing to reimburse the tickets we had to purchase just to get home because of their cancelled flight. It's not like they refunded us the cancelled flight either because of us choosing the option for reimbursement(it was either/or). Finally, he calls them back, requests an American employee (I know, he's bad), and they will try to resend the vouchers. Guess that's the best we'll get, be further in the hole from this single round-trip through Frontier that we thought would be kind to our wallets."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Providence,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Absolutely the worst airline I have ever experienced. I booked a flight from Reno to Providence with a layover in Denver. The flight from Reno was an estimated 3 hour delay, but ended up being 6 hours including the 3 hour spent on the run way. They estimated I would miss my connection and scheduled me for a different one later in the night. We arrived to Denver at 2 am and I didn't make the connection. 20 people were left stranded in Denver airport with no compensation for hotels!!! There response was simply that corporate said no. You can't do this to people!! Leave them stranded in a city at 2 am with no where to go. Most of us slept in the airport and my flight isn't until 12 am tonight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Buffalo to Orlando,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Buffalo to Orlando. In all my travels I have never experienced a disaster of an airline. Starting at the gate in the airport. The amount of unorganized staff was something to be desired. The flight was to depart at 255pm, I arrived at the airport at 1200 to find that the flight was already on the board as delayed. And from what I’m being told, it’s a regular occurrence with this airline. The staff have the inability to communicate properly. That’s from the staff at the airport to the crew on the aircraft. After a delay of over 2 and a half hours, we finally get on our way. And at no point did the staff advise the reason for the delay, or other any of the passengers anything. Earlier in the week, the same flight was delayed over 5 hours and it wasn’t until 2 and a half hours did they advise the passengers would have to disembark due to mechanical issues that the mechanic didn’t have the proper tools to fix. After another 2 hours delay, they finally brought another plane in. Yes, the flights were cheap but if you have somewhere to be, or just plain don’t want to waste your precious time, do not. I repeat, do not fly Frontier"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The first and the last time I will ever fly with them. My fiancé and I waited more than 45 min to check my bag. We arrived 2.5 hours before hand and have TSA pre check. I was still panicking prior to my departure. The airline boarded the flight 30-45 min late.. ok no big deal. We sat on the runway for 2 hours due to weather issues in the current area. Meanwhile, we’re looking out of the window, watching American Airlines and Southwest take off. Everyone was confused. The pilot comes over the intercom stating that our flight has been cancelled. The time that I sat on the runway due to delays is the same amount of time we would’ve spent in the air. We were redirected to the ticket counter for refunds. There were no other flights that frontier offered, that were headed to PHL that evening. American Airlines had a few options that were reasonably priced, as an alternative. I’m researching while waiting in line, with 200+ frustrated passengers. There was 1 desk attendant helping all of us. I waited in line for 4 hours for my refund, only for my fiancé to say “enough with this waiting, let’s bite the bullet and stay at a hotel”. I ended up not getting my refund. I guess American Airlines took advantage of the opportunity and marked the PHL flights up twice as much. Shame on me for not buying the tickets immediately, once I heard the flight had been cancelled. I ended up paying $1500 for the both of us because it was crucial we got home within the next 24hrs. What a joke. I called their 1-800 number . They instructed we had to waqit in line in order to get a full refund. Our flight tickets totaled to $425  + $1,500 American Airlines flight home + $120 hotel room, uber to and from hotel, food and stress. A very costly flight home. I was more than disappointed with frontier. I will never fly with them again. Please fly with caution and a credit card when choosing Frontier."

To start, I couldn't get the online app to work on my phone for mobile checkin. Next - get to the airport and this airline charges me $45 for a carry on bag. Just one normal bag that every other airline allows me to carry on for free. Next, get on the plane and seats don't recline, not even a little bit. Then - I get to the airport to for my return flight. I arrived in plenty of time to make the flight, probably 40-45 minutes before the scheduled take off time. Because I fly all the time, I was very confident that since the flight was 7.10am and there was no long security line, that I would have time. I arrived to the airport to find out that nobody was at the checkin desk - the checkin kiosk would NOT allow me to check in. I was not the only person standing there wondering why nobody was there to check people in to the flight. Ultimately, I missed this flight - and by the way people, they only have 1 direct flight a day to many destinations. I had to call my company to book another flight for me and luckily I didn't have to pay for it. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to San Francisco via Denver,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We flew from Washington DC to San Francisco via Denver. The first leg of the trip was fine but things really went awry on our evening connecting flight to SF: as we were getting ready to take off, a delay was announced due to a computer malfunction. After sitting on the plane for another hour or so, our flight was cancelled - at 11pm! The next Denver to SF flight on Frontier would not be for another 2 days. We had to to retrieve our bags from another terminal, arrange & pay for a flight on another carrier and slept overnight on the floor of the Denver airport as Frontier was unable to assist with any hotel accommodations. We travel 1-3 times a year but we will never fly Frontier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Denver to San Francisco. Frontier has little to no customer service. On both my departing and returning flights the people loading the plain were extremely rude. Not only were both flights delayed each way but when we asked what the problem was the frontier representatives told us to mind or own business. I couldn't believe the way these people treat their customers. They should be ashamed of themselves.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Cancun to Portland, Oregon",July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1," Worst airline ever! Packed a carry on for my trip to avoid fees, ended up having to pay double the amount any other airlines would have charged. Carry on cost $52, the same to check a bag. Flight was slightly delayed in Cancun to Denver, which was fine. But the seats were terrible, they don’t recline, no complimentary beverages or snacks and spent 45 min on the tarmac waiting for a terminal to open up. Upon landing, I received an e-mail saying our connecting flight was delayed an hour and a half, well that time came and went. Our flight was then further delayed, totalling 2.5 hour delay, only because the airlines didn’t have the name of the flight attendants on a sheet of paper, therefore they were not allowed aboard. We now are taking a red eye back home and had to be up for work early, with no sleep and a terrible experience. I will forever stay true to Alaska Airlines! They get it right and so do many others, there is no reason they can’t figure It out. Get a clue. I’ve now researched Frontier Airlines and see that I’m just another millionth customer with the same experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,New York to Atlanta ,July 2018,1.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I will never fly Frontier again. First of all it is not a savings because you end up paying more with your baggage so you might as well fly a professional flight like Delta or Southwest and forget all the hassle. Customer service was terrible they don't know how to treat people, they try to fool people with the baggage. So make sure you read all the fine print, it was awful. I flew Frontier for my company to find out should my company use their outline and I told them no never and my company fly out every week. The only thing nice about Frontier was the pilots and that was it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Denver,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Customer service is awful and unapologetic. I get that flights are delayed for several reasons. My return flight from PWM to SEA (with layover in DEN) was delayed due to mechanical error. The flight was already delayed before we were even made aware of this. We then boarded the plane, wait some time, and then were told about the mechanical issue, and so had to de-board the plane. After an even longer wait time, they had to manually check us in and re-board, so that was slow and unorganized. Communication was so poor and customer service was rude. A lot of us missed our connecting flight. We were given the option to continue to DEN and figure out the rest there; or, get a refund and book thru another airline, with flights leaving the next day (I’ll breakdown prices later). Most of us opted for DEN bc the refund deal was terrible. Finally at DEN, we had to wait in the plane while they find a terminal, and then wait in line at customer service to figure out our connecting flights. There were >30 people in line and one person at customer service. When a few of us called customer service, we were told they couldn’t help us over the phone and that we had to deal with this in person. I finally get to the desk past midnight, and my options were to book the next flight to SEA (which was 24 hrs later. I got a hotel voucher for up to $150, but it being midnight, the hotels available were twice the cost. And I had to call around different concierge desks and find/book the hotel myself; no help from Frontier), get on an earlier plane to Portland, OR but figure out the rest of the way back to Seattle on my own and at my cost, or partial refund and book with another airline. Speaking of refunds, here were the options and prices given to me: My total round trip flight was $502.90, after added fees for carry-on, check-in, and seat selection. Partial refund for return flight from PWM to SEA (so this should be half the total): $180 Soonest flight from PWM to SEA on another airline: $415 cheapest, leaving next day Partial refund for return flight from DEN to SEA (so this should be a quarter of the total): per the lady at customer service, “You’d be lucky if you got $80” Soonest flight from DEN to SEA on another airline: $256 leaving the next morning w/ no layovers. $228 leaving the next evening w/ layovers As I stated earlier, I opted for booking the next flight and found a hotel. When I asked the customer service lady where I can retrieve my checked-in bag, she looked at my condescendingly and said, “why would you need that?” After explaining the obvious (by this point, it was 1:30AM and my flight was at 10PM), she said I could get someone to retrieve it, but that it’s be another hour and a half. This was an awful experience! I will never fly Frontier again."

Initially, the price seems great, but they nickel and dime you on bags, drinks, and seat assignments. Our flight was delayed as was the other Frontier flight that was leaving our gate.These were the first two flights of the day! After we boarded, we were then told to that they had more work to do on the ""placard,"" so we had to exit the plane. After my experience and reading the other reviews, this seems like the norm for this airline. Spend the extra, you get what you pay for."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Detroit,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2," Orlando to Detroit. We were notified 4:00 a.m via text and email that our return flight home from Orlando had been cancelled. We received no explanation of why it was cancelled. We called the Frontier to get more information and was told that flight had been cancelled and we would have to book another flight, we attempted to do so to realize there were no other flights until tomorrow. This being unacceptable and not an option for us to stay another night we explained we could not do this, and was told if we had to book with another flight we would have to make sure we completed documentation for refund and what carrier we had to go through. We were truly upset that the only flight we could find that could accommodate was going to cost us more than the original full trip airfare we paid. We received an email about a voucher we could use for up to 90 days that simply said sorry for inconvenience. Why would we want to fly Frontier ever again, when you couldn't provide us with professional customer service to get us home? Then told we will not get reimbursed for 4 to 6 weeks. Horrible customer service even after asking to speak with a manager, they seemed so unaffected by the lives of our family members and we had kids. What if we didn't have the money to get back home, I guess we would have just been stranded until we did. Delta was friendly, but much higher cost. I guess you get what you pay for. Never Again and we better get our money refunded!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Colorado Springs,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Chicago to Colorado Springs. Inattentive staff, overbooked flights, and inadequate compensation after being told they no longer have seats available.  My wife and I flew out of Colorado Springs, arriving early and being the only people at the counter. We stood at the counter while the attendant worked on her computer for a solid 2 minutes, having looked briefly at us, but not acknowledging us in any other manner. At first I thought she was finishing something that couldn't wait, but she said nothing, shuffled papers around, and continue until I spoke up and said I like to check in. She looked to her right as if there was supposed to be someone that was going to come over to her counter and help us. Since the Frontier website wasn't letting me pre-check early that day we got the worst seats in the plane, which were at the back near the toilets and unable to recline. On the flight we sat two rows behind a group of women that talked loudly, laughing and carrying on long after the lights had gone out (this was a late night flight). People were irritated, and the couple in front of us asked the people to be quiet, and they quieted down for a bit before gradually getting louder. The staff made no attempt to remedy the situation. What really angered me, and will make this the first and last time I try to save a buck by flying Frontier, is on the on the way back to Colorado Springs from Chicago. This is a domestic flight, so we arrived an hour before our flight, and when checking in were told that we'd need to go the gate to get seats assigned. We went and got there about 15 minutes before boarding only to find out that we didn't have seats. We had an international flight the following morning and they attempted to get someone to switch with us, but no luck. We ended up getting reimbursed for the return flight, plus some cash, which was still $200 less than the cost of the tickets we had to buy in order to catch our flight the following day. Yes, we ended up paying more than original tickets due to their incompetence. The counter staff was polite and helpful in Chicago, and obviously as irritated with the situation as we were as they has to deal with other people in a similar situation. So in summation, terrible service at the counter in Colorado Springs, terrible in-flight service, and awful customer relations. When you pay for a product you expect to receive it. If you can't deliver your product then what good is your business? Frontier is the absolute worse airline I have ever flown and I will gladly pay an extra hundred on my next flight in order to not have to deal with them again. I can only give a 2 star for ground service because the Chicago staff was quite patient and apologetic. Everything else is a solid 1, and the overall would be zero if I could."

I want this to be a simple review and so this airline is by far the worst airline I've experienced. My flight was cancelled twice, and I was given a $200 voucher because of the inconvenience. Not only that, I'm flying away from TX because my husband deploys in 2 days and I've tried calling about 10 times (still trying to get in contact with a rep.) and still nothing. There's nothing but an automated lady given you options to choose or say and then nothing happens thereafter. My flight was booked incorrectly for the day after it was cancelled instead of the day after the day on the newly booked flight. I've spoken to the rep. who assisted me in the airport and he also booked my flight incorrectly which is the flight that got cancelled in the first place. I'm traveling with my 1 year old daughter, which already makes it a little harder, and then I have to deal with the inconvenience of this airlines' approach for their customer. "

When all 200 of us got to the ticketing counter no one was there to help us for 20 minutes. The manager was no help, I ended up booking a ticket on a different airline and paid 5x what I paid for this flight. They have terrible service, are not reliable and do not take care of their customers. Its worth an extra, $100 or $200 on any other airline to avoid this nightmare. Do not fly Frontier."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to Phoenix. All the hidden fees for this airline will have you end up paying more than you'd do for some other airlines, so Frontier is NOT ever the cheapest option, unless you want to travel with just your handbag or man-purse, and with no food or beverage what so ever. However, the worst part is the tremendous issues they have with cancelled flights and enormous delays, as well as HUGE customer service issues. Our flight back from Phoenix Arizona to Denver Colorado (F9 758) on July 8th was supposed to leave 9.30 in the morning, it was in segments pushed forward until 5 p.m. so people ended up having to spend their whole day in or in the vicinity of the airport. Many had to cancel their ticket and try to get on other planes, costing them a lot of money (and delays). However, this can happen to any airline, but we did receive many messages saying that it is COMMON for Frontier to have these issues. Still, most can be forgiven, but not the awful attitude of Frontier staff. Me and my partner stayed at the airport, but chose to spend the day at the terminal that had all the restaurants and shops. We checked our phones for updates on flight changes (as Frontier chooses to send these updates via texts and that's how we'd know about the delays in the first place). An airline employee had told us to not check our one bat, but to instead show up between 3 and 4 p.m. for our flight estimated to now leave 5 p.m., only 7.5 hours late. We showed up at 3.30 sharp and were informed by an incredibly rude female employee that we had missed our flight. Shocked, we checked our phones for any updates of the flight being scheduled earlier, but not were sent, apparently Frontier wants you to camp by the gates for 7 hours, just in case. At the terminal with no food venues. The worst part was that the male employee who had told us to come in between 3 and 4 pm, was there right next to the woman, and did not want to admit that we had only followed his direct advice. Another jarring fact was that the plane was just finishing boarding, and we COULD have been allowed on board, except for the fact that the female employee wouldn't let us. When we directly asked if they had simply sold our tickets to somebody else, she became very defensive, so case in point. We will never again use Frontier, no matter how favorable the price looks. We ended up renting a car, having to drive the whole night, just to get home in reasonable time."

Flight cancelled the night before I was scheduled to fly out, via email. Used the app to check-in and get through security until I finally found out that my flight was actually cancelled. I went to the Frontier desk only to be given no help in finding another flight or booking with another airline to get a flight. Terrible customer service who only handed me a piece of paper as their way of communicating. The $200 flight voucher I received means literally nothing since my flight will probably be cancelled again if I book with them. Unreliable."

There was no compensation no Hotel no food voucher no sorries. They just did not care. They were perfectly fine stating to me that they could get me home 48 hours later from my original flight pattern. I am disgusted with this company and how they handled my situation they did not even say sorry or state or show any remorse to the fact that they delayed a flight 12 hours prior to its actual departure time they just shrugged their shoulders and asked me if they would like me to rebook. I stated to them NO, to refund me and I will take another airline in which I took Alaska Airlines which got me out of Denver within 4 hours arriving to Seattle. Alaska Airlines stepped up where Frontier failed. I could have easily have been home if they would have had their flight wait for me as I departed the aircraft which is allowed on situations like this because I know for a fact since I used to be an Airline customer service gate agent this is not something new on delayed flights and they could have had this done for me and they failed to do so. I will never fly them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vegas to Portland,July 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Completely and utterly unsatisfied. We left Vegas heading to Portland maine with a layover in Denver. In Vegas, our flight was delayed by 2 hrs. I questioned the staff if this would cause any issues with our other flight and she told me that they are holding the plane for the passengers that are to board it. We finally left Vegas at 4 am and did not get off the plane until 615am. Upon arrival, I stopped and asked someone about the plane they were holding. She looked it up and informed us that it had already left and to go to customer service. No big deal! So we went and was informed that the next available flight was Thursday morning. That would leave us stranded at the airport for 2 full days. I questioned where our luggage was and was told it was going to Portland. I told them no one would be there and how were we supposed to get it. She said they will give us a call if we haven't picked it up in 24 hrs. So now we have no luggage for 2 days. I asked if they could provide lodging where they messed up or food vouchers. The lady kept repeating the same thing, ""your options are you can refund the tickets and it will be back in your account in 7 to 10 business days or you can wait til Thursday"". They would not provide any accommodations even though they messed up. We went back to the lady at customer service 3 times and she told us the same things over and over again and finally that they couldn't help us. There was another person who flew on the same plane and was going to the same destination. She informed us that they paid for her to take another plane to get home today. We asked again if they could do this and we still got nothing. So now, at this point, we are stranded with no lodging, no transportation, no food, no luggage and no money to get things. We decided to go to the baggage claim because it didn't make sense that our bags caught the flight to Maine if we didnt. We asked the check bag area and they informed us our bags should be here, but no one knew where they were. At this point, I was crying mad. I called corporate and was on the phone for 45 minutes between a customer service person and a supervisor before my call was disconnected. I called back and was on the phone for another 1.5 hours with a supervisor and them finally someone higher up. In the meantime, we are still in the baggage claim and just so happened to see bags that looked like ours. 4 hours later!  Finally got through to a man named that stated he would fully reimburse us if we bought tickets with another airline. 5 hours of hassle. Now we wait and see if they reimburse us. Not happy and would never recommend this airline to anyone."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco ,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Frontier Airlines is never on time. The seats are terribly uncomfortable. It’s not like the prices are dirt cheap. This is the problem with all domestic airlines in America. Every one of them messes their customers around. Why is there always a delay of at least an hour? Why do they ask customers to be two hours early. If there’s 200 people on the plane that’s a delay of 200 hours. Is there no respect for people’s time?
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Raleigh Durham,July 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  New Orleans to Raleigh Durham. This airline is horrible. Online it said my bag to check would be between $20 /25. When I got to the airport it was $45. Online it ended up being $38 (one way). The chairs were not comfortable at all and there was no room at all and I'm 5'7. I could imagine if my 6'4 boyfriend was with me. The plane looked outdated and needed major upgrades. All beverages and snacks had a fee. Even water. And the icing on the cake is when I had to wait almost an hour for my luggage when I got home because they said they were understaffed!  I paid just a little less than American and delta but next time I will definitely pay an extra 150-200 for a better airline. Never again!

I planned to visit my boyfriend in Salt Lake City a month ahead of time and bought my ticket from Frontier Airlines, if I had known at the time all the trouble I would have to go through I would have went with another airline. The first problem I had was on the way out to Salt Lake City, it was a delay of 3 hours in the Denver airport. This was an inconvenience, however not the end of the world. The night before my flight back to Little Rock I received an email that said my flight was cancelled and it only gave me two options, to either get a refund on the unused part of my ticket plus travel miles with Frontier (obviously I don't want to fly with Frontier ever again) or to get a refund of up to $400 if I bought a ticket with another airline plus more travel miles with Frontier. The original round-trip ticket was only $375 and I would have only gotten half of that back. So in more simple terms I was being screwed out of money since their company policy is not to pay you back in full the cost of the new ticket. The night before my flight there is no way I could have found a ticket with another airline cheaper than $400. I ended up paying $600 for my one-way ticket back home since it was so last minute. I would think with any respectable airline there would have been another option (or a full refund for the new ticket in previous options would have sufficed), to offer another flight free of charge. Frontier Airlines clearly doesn't strive to serve customers to the customer's satisfaction. They left me stranded in a city hours from my home without even the option of giving me a full refund on the new ticket I had to buy because they cancelled my flight the night before. It is very disappointing that Frontier doesn't take care of its customers and works with them."

Our 9:25pm flight was delayed until 11:25. Okay cool. 30 minutes later another email that our flight has been delayed again and will now arrive at 1am. So I'm paying for a room that I cannot stay in - money wasted, uncomfortable and tired. Next comes the announcement regarding mechanical issues and the flight crew needing to be changed and we will try to have everyone boarded by 1:30am. $400 plane ticket. Wheres the manager? Do I get a portion of the cost returned? Some credits to fly another airline? Safety is of upmost importance and with that in mind, I will not fly Frontier again."

I have traveled throughout Asia and Africa, and this was by far the worst airline I’ve ever used. The hidden fees add up to the price of any other major airline. You are better off with any other option than this one. Our flight was canceled 4 hours before departure to Cancun and on the way back it was massively delayed. Then their system broke down and everyone waited 1 hour to check in. No free snacks offered. No free entertainment. We were offered a credit for Frontier but I honestly will never use this airline again."

We planned a trip to Orlando for a vacation with family, we had plans and we missed out on the activities that we paid for. The person on the intercom you could barely understand what he was saying, we asked to speak to manager and was told the manager was busy, then police came because there was so many people in the waiting area. It’s sad my first and last time flying Frontier and they have the nerve to charge for snacks and pop, we should have been given something for the inconvenience. Now I’m trying to return home and my gate was changed, I was not notified once again while we were in the waiting room and all you see is delayed flights. I hope I make it home today as plan I understand things happen but communication is key!"

Two emails were received regarding delayed departure, got to the airport and we were informed that our flight was canceled! Frontier refused to provide us with any assistance. Such as, access to a wheelchair and certainly no help getting a return flight. We were told to ""use the white courtesy phone to arrange for another flight with another airline."" Do not use Frontier. They're not there to help you, they're all about taking your money and leaving you stranded."

Was very nervous/skeptical to fly Frontier given the reviews I have read. I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth the trip actually went. Slight delays coming and going, but nothing that I would say is abnormal. The one negative is that you have to pay extra for everything (bags, snacks, drinks, etc) and there was no in plane entertainment. Other than those factors, the flight was great."

First and last time I’ve will be flying with them. I needed to get to a wedding in Grand Rapids and they cancelled the flight last minute. The options they gave me would only cost me more money and their representatives were unbelievably unhelpful. They have ruined a very important day for me and cost me a huge amount of money. They should be ashamed of themselves.

First flight was from colorado springs to Chicago and they delayed the flight for 2 hours and eventually canceled the flight. Again from Denver to Orlando it was delayed 2 hours. Then Orlando to Denver the flight was canceled for mechanical issues but when they knew about the cancellation a day ahead and didnt let anyone know until we were at the ticket counter with the rest of the people for the flight.

The experience was an awful one from behind to end and we ended not ever even getting into the air! We boarded our flight on time to leave at 0940 & an announcement was made stating there was a “smudge” on the stabilizer & once it was looked at closer it would be signed off on & we would be in the air within 20 minutes. The 20 minutes turned into 35 then 45 then 90 minutes while being strung along by the crew with “it will be just a few more minutes before take off...” they finally allowed us to deboard the aircraft and told us to return at 1300 to board, we returned and were told there were no updates and that no accommodations would be made. After a frenzy the flight was finally declared cancel with no flights out to our destination for about 4 days! We then had to jump through hoops to track down our luggage so that we could change our plans. There was no level of empathy or apology offered by any team member at any point during the process. It was completely awful & I’ll pay extra just to avoid this airline in the future."

The flight was cancelled 8 hours before the flight so now we’re stuck in Denver with no money. The staff in Denver said the only available flight for us to get to Grand Rapids was in two days. They said they would refund us the money it cost us to get a flight from a different airline but we have no money to purchase tickets from another airline in order for them to reimburse us. The staff also said they couldn’t give us meal or a hotel voucher so we are stuck in Denver for two days with no money for food or a hotel. Terrible customer service and the staff was all clueless and rude.

The email should be sent at least 2 hours prior to the delay so that the passengers don’t arrive early. The flight got delayed even while travelling from Minneapolis to Raleigh by two hours. Inconvenient and unprofessional.

The flight was delayed due to plane getting in late. I do not fault the airline because I don't know circumstances of delay, but know it happens on every airline. All staff were pleasant. Seats are very small with little legroom. But I'm 5'2"", so no problem. If it were a long flight, I'd be bummed, but it wasn't. Plus they do indicate legroom restrictions on their site, so I knew in advance. I chose to fly no frills and was prepared. I only took a personal item, no didn't need to pay additional carry on charges. I see so many negative reviews, but they are up front on their site, so unsure why complaints of things they should have read. I would fly Frontier Airlines again for short distances."

We were promptly given mean vouchers worth $15 each and free coffee on the flight as well. The staff kept up their good spirits the whole time. I was particularly pleased with how the delay was handled. $150 compensation vouchers were emailed without having to even ask and the customer care agents were very helpful. This was the best experience of customer service I’ve had in a long time and I would definitely rate it 5 stars. Kudos to Frontier airlines and it’s staff!

The price may seem appealing, but you will not get to your destination without experiencing a delay or cancellation! My flight to Vegas was cancelled and I wasn’t emailed about it until I spent $60 to Uber at the airport. When I went to ask about finding another flight, the soonest one was 3 days later. They said they would provide a $400 voucher to fly with another airline, but that didn’t cover half the cost of the inconvenience or flight with another airline. I had requested off of work and needless to say I didn’t end up going to Las Vegas."

Denver used to have such pride in our hometown airline, but “short-sighted” is a kind way of describing the current management strategy. They’ve entered into the “low-cost” carrier race to the bottom, with enticing ticket prices before the barrage of hassles, upsells and add-ons make you wish you had never heard of them. It’s a terrible business model. Terrible customer experience. Leads to terrible employee morale. Just an awful shell of its former self at this point."

We booked a round trip flight and our returning flight was scheduled for Wednesday July 4th at 8:47 am. Once we arrived to check in they informed us the flight didn’t exist, even though we could pull that flight up on the website and we got multiple email confirmations. They did absolutely nothing to help or accommodate us other than say “well there’s a flight tomorrow for 8:47 am.” The worst customer service I have ever encountered. We then had to buy tickets through Delta to return home at a much higher cost and for a later time, inconveniencing us financially and time wise. I am extremely disappointed with this airline and if you read any reviews you will see that they are all 1 star for a reason. I don’t know how this airline stays in business but I can tell you for sure that I am usually a Delta flyer and I will never stray from them again. Frontier, I would reccomend hiring better employees and cleaning up your act. I’m a business owner myself and would never leave a review if i didn’t 100% mean it because I truly believe good customer service can change any bad experience. But this airline did nothing to even try to make up for this for horrible occurrence. Shame on you."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Las Vegas,July 2018,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Raleigh to Las Vegas. Worst airline experience ever! The inbound aircraft was delayed by over two hours with absolutely no information what so ever. I just received any email stating the new departure time. After waiting at the gate for over an hour past our new departure time we get notified that our flight is cancelled because of the “seven day rule” which does not allow flight attendants to work for more than seven consecutive days. I don’t understand how the airline or the flight attendant didn’t notify someone before the inbound flight was delayed. The issue could have been averted hours earlier. Then the entire plane was instructed to move to the ticketing counter to receive vouchers. We stood in line at the ticketing counter for almost an hour and a half with absolutely no one there to help or assist us. When we finally do get assistance we are told that the next available flight won’t be for another two days. They will not book us on another airline but we have the option to purchase a new ticket with a new airline with our own money and they will reimburse us up to $400 within thirty days. There are absolutely no other flights to get us to Las Vegas from North Carolina for $400 within the next week. Other passengers tried avoiding the line and calling customer service themselves but were on hold with the company for well over an hour. And the icing on the cake was finding out my checked bag had been missing because they forgot to place it on the conveyer belt. Bottom line is to avoid Frontier Airlines at all costs.

My bestie and I have had this trip planned for months to see our other bestie in Denver. Loved the prices Frontier offered. If only we knew the headache it caused us. The flight was delayed twice and then was cancelled an hour later and there was no notification in the handy dandy app you have. After spending 20 minutes trying to find an information desk and helpful employee, we went back to get more information and hopefully find a way to start our vacation. The crew “timed out” so they had to cancel. The customer service representatives acted like it was an inconvenience to them for us being mad and confused why our flight was delayed. We were told we were going to get our money back and a $500 voucher each from Frontier to only be told via e-mail it would be $200 each. Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to fly any other airline. I wish I did that from the start. I would like the money I was promised in person. I would also recommend employing people with better customer service ability. Also, crew members to fly the plane you oh so generously offered us and cancelled 2 hours before the departure time."

This was their third chance and they did it again. They simply cannot be on time. Several hour delays lead to missed connections, lost luggage and entire vacations or business trips ruined. They are grossly understaffed and no one has time to help you. Good luck talking to anyone or getting any answers. They instilled zero confidence that our plane would depart on time but never changed rhe departure time online or within the posted flights at the airport. Lastly you get nothing without encountering additional fees. No seat assignment. No carry on. Not even water. What a joke this airline is. Sorry excuse for a business"

This is the second time in a week our flight with Frontier is delayed more than 2 hours. No texts or communication so we arrived at the airport for our originally scheduled departure.

Our first return flight from Mexico was delayed for an hour and then cancelled with no explanation of why, after we waited for 6 hours in the airport. We were then transferred by bus to a hotel which left much to be desired. Our flight was rescheduled for the next day and it also was delayed for an hour. Then we were loaded onto buses and taken to our plane which had no terminal, we loaded by steps on the tarmac. Once in flight for 2.5 hours we were told that there was bad weather in St Louis and we didn't have enough fuel to circle until it passed. We were rerouted to Kansas City where we stayed for 45 minutes. We finally landed in St Louis at 8pm and we boarded the plane at 3pm. We then had to wait for another broken down plane to be moved from the terminal that we needed to unload into until 10pm, 7 hours on the plane. What should have been a 3 hour flight took us 7 hours. We were only offered refreshments at the beginning of the flight, but not again after that. 7 hours without anything is a bit ridiculous."

Our flight was delayed 4 times in perfect weather only to be cancelled at midnight due to crew being timed out, something which an airline should be able to know about several hours before the flight. They were anything but helpful in booking hotels and new flights. You have to do that all on your own. Never have I had to do that when I’ve had canceled flights in similar situations. Also, Frontier could not get us to our destination for 2 full days. They only reimburse you a set amount, which we went over, and you have to front the cost. It cost me $2700 to fly and house my family, $800 which I will not be reimbursed. I spoke with customer service and they did not say anything that their generic form letter didn’t already say. They did not reimburse our difference and had no resolution to the situation. I will never be flying with this airline again. If you need to be someplace the day following your suggested flight time, I would book another airline, because even when the weather is fine, there’s no guarantee you will make it to your destination that day."

Oh and we showed up early to check in and there was nobody at the desk to check my bags, there was a line out the door for our flight and nobody came to the desk until there was less than an hour and a half left until boarding. Seats are uncomfortable and you must pay extra for everything, seems cheap at first but after all the fees, and what not it ends up being the same price as other airlines.

My flight was delayed for nearly 3 hours, as they said, because the plane had too much fuel and needed to defuel since it was not the plane for this route originally. Delay is okay as mishaps can happen unexpectedly. The crew was not nearly as friendly as Southwest. They don't provide internet and or giving an option to purchase. The worst part was not being offered any snacks or drinks unless you pay for them, and they were expensive. After the delay, there was barely time to get to the next flight which is also understandable. However, on another 4 hour flight, they offered nothing to drink as a courtesy especially to the delayed group unless asking for it and they'd give you a small cup of water with not so happy facial expression. If I'd compare to Southwest, they have a negative 10 points. Indeed, they didn't seem to care much for little kids needs which is such a shame because that is most important. And luggage claim, the longest wait ever as if they were looking for someone to load them up. To top it all off, they lost our luggage. Avoid flying with Frontier airline at all cost."

The service isn't that great and even though flights are cheap, paying for check-in or even a carry-on is $45, each. Nothing is complimentary and they delay flights for hours with no explanation (and I assure you it is not due to weather). I've never had a problem flying Delta, United or American Airlines and this was my first experience flying Frontier, but I am never flying Frontier again. On the flight schedule board there were many Frontier flights delayed for other locations while other airlines were not delayed and I'm definitely going to paying more for a different flight next time."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Minneapolis,June 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Raleigh to Minneapolis. Desk agent made us miss the flight, no refund. We arrived at RDU two hours before the flight, checked our one bag, and verified boarding using their mobile service. Then when we got to the security gate, the boarding passes would not load and we ran to the check-in counter to ask them to immediately call to the gate and reprint the boarding passes. The woman (Friday June 29, 3pm) took so much time not listening to what we were saying that by the time she understood that we were asking for, the plane had just begun to board (this was now 25 minutes before departure). She still would not make that simple call! Instead she kept trying to look for new bookings and stall. Meanwhile, we lost the chance to board, we lost the chance to reclaim our luggage, and we were now stuck. I am traveling with a person with special needs who left his medication in the luggage, by the way. A different agent came up and said that since we were “locked down,” he would put a note in the file so that we could at least get a refund. And he would call later about holding the luggage in Minneapolis. No call, no note in the system, and no cooperation when calling the number he provided for Frontier assistance. This has been a nightmare that is now costing us $800 just to rebook with a different airline to get to our destination-a day and a half later. Frontier has horrible customer service and no integrity."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Orlando,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Philadelphia to Orlando. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. This is my first time flying frontier, and I am more than dissatisfied. I thought the cheaper airfare was a good deal, until you pay an arm and a leg for luggage including carry ons. My entire family of 5 was split up after picking and paying for preassigned seats so we could all sit together. I was stuck in a row next to a flight attended who very rudely slammed down his seat into my arm. And the entire flight I almost felt like I was harassed by flight attendants who just wouldn’t keep quiet. There’s comes a point where service is just annoying, and talking on the loud speaker 5min + multiple times, was the tip of the iceberg. It also took almost an hour after the plan landed to start retrieving luggage. Which I guess the handlers of my luggage just wanted to see how far they could launch it onto the conveyor belt, because my make up that was wrapped up was opened and destroyed. Seriously will never ever fly again. Horrible airline."

First time flying this airline and I’m not really liking it so far. Ground service, Seat Comfort, and Legroom was awful. TSA guys at Trenton were telling us where we are going to and why and that set me off a little. The crew were very good. Frontier Airlines  charge for food & Beverages."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Denver,October 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Seattle to Denver. I purchased a ticket through one of their ""AH-MAZING"" deals, turns out the this deal comes with all types of ridiculous issues and poor customer care. Their hidden fees for seat selections and crazy baggage rules for carry ins were the beginning of their demise in my opinion. However they now play this game when their aircraft are not at a certain capacity they delay and cancel flights on you, citing ""mechanical"" problems. I had a 7.35pm flight originally which started with a 2 hour delay at 10am that morning -  a delay that early? The next email I received came in at 2pm with your flight has been cancelled! I sat on hold for 48 minutes to try and find out what the heck was going only to be told the plane had mechanical problems. They then rebooked me without offering me any type of compensation or credit vouchers. I was rebooked on the next flight out at 1255am red eye to Denver, this plane is also delayed due to the flight crew was not in the building!  We are now an overcrowded plane of passengers with tired children, cranky passengers and if we want a snack or drink forget it, because they charge you for everything and we get to sit in plastic seats that no one can fit in. I rather pay more on another airline than have my time wasted. I am done with this airline!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,June 2018,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,3,no,2,"  I purchased a round trip from Indianapolis to Orlando, this was my first time flying and Frontier provided a terrible experience. The flight to Orlando was delayed 7 hours and now my flight home is already delayed an hour. Not only is this inconvenient for me, but also for the people picking me up. They provided a credit, which is very much appreciated, but it’s terms stated I had to use it within 90 days and it’s not possible for me to use it within that window. I understand delays happen, but this has just been absolutely ridiculous. I will not be flying with Frontier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Colorado Springs,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Washington to Colorado Springs. Killed my first vacation in 3 years. I was going to fly to a friends wedding and they canceled the flight. Now I understand that these things happen but it was how they handled the cancellation that has me so upset. First I received the text that the flight was delayed after I had already arrived at the airport and been told by the ticketing counter that it was canceled. Next the contractors at the counter were extremely rude, loudly letting me know that they were contractors not employed by Frontier and making it all too clear that they could care less about my frustrations. Normally in an instance such as this the airline would try to find you another flight to get you to your destination as close to your time as possible, but not Frontier. Frontier simply gives you a piece of paper and a phone number and tells you to figure it out on your own. That piece of paper that they handed me says that they will offer me $400 dollars to find a new flight, which is a joke. There were absolutely no flights that could get me to my destination on time for anything less then double that price. I again approached the frontier desk and was told that I was out of luck and anything over the 400 was my obligation, again letting me know that they were contractors and could care less about my problem. Next I call the number they gave me to let them know that their reimbursement was not satisfactory and they simply passed me from office to office. After 1 hour and 20 minutes of being on hold I gave up. Now I am out the costs associated with the trip that I could not cancel as I was within the 24 hr cancelation window totaling more then $1000 of which the customer service that I did get to speak to, before being put on hold, claimed was not their responsibility. I will never fly with Frontier again and will actively advise all I know to avoid as well. By far and away the worst experience I have ever had with an airline!"

I traveled Frontier Airlines multiple Times and have always had a great experience. Overall, I’ve saved thousands of dollars traveling with this airline. Their representative was very patient and thoughtful while booking my four flights over the phone. Their app was convenient for listing the itinerary, checking in, and keeping me up to date. The staff is friendly, and the plane was clean. You pay a fraction of the cost in comparisons to other airlines, so don’t get upset if you have to pay a fee for baggage or snacks, watching tv, eating snacks, and having a reclining seat."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Providence,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Tampa to Providence. This is quite possibly the worst airline you could choose to fly with. Today, 6/29/18, we got to the gate and were met with a clumsy and unsophisticated gate assistant who did not know how to vocalize in proper and concise English. The plane before us was delayed, and then they claimed there was a security issue. This resulted in a one hour delay. They then allowed us to board, and once we were completely boarded, they told us there was actually a slough of maintenance issues that needed to be fixed. This then resulted in an additional two hour delay with all of us on the plane, because their paperwork was apparently not being processed. They were about to let passengers leave the plane purely because of laws regarding delays, but would’ve forced us to take all of our luggage with us and then would leave if we weren’t right at the gate when they were ready. Additionally, all of the attendants and pilots on board were ill-spoken and clumsy as well. I will never fly on this airline again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Las Vegas,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I will never fly Frontier again. Cheap flights because they charge you for everything else. There is NO service on flight unless you buy something. Flights delayed, charges for bags, charges for carry on, charges for water or pop. Unbelievably rude staff, especially in Vegas. They charged us $90 for 2 medium bags and wouldn't give us a receipt. When I asked for a receipt I was told ""businesses don't give receipts anymore"". I told them I needed a receipt for business travel so he put a receipt on my boarding pass. There was no receipt. Just a sticker with flight info. I went back to get a receipt and he said ""Do you really need a receipt or do you just want to argue with me? Frontier obviously doesn't believe in, or train their employees about customer service. I have traveled for 30 years and never had a worse experience. Looking at the flight board and every Frontier flight is currently delayed. We've spent more time being delayed than it took to fly roundtrip. Awful airline and employees."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Las Vegas,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Atlanta to Las Vegas. Nobody books with Frontier expecting the best or the frills but the treatment that we have received is inexcusable. After roughly 7 hours of delays and a complete lack of communication some of the customers ended up grabbing the intercom system and venting on there because there was no one at the front desk. Instead of responding to that appropriately they sent someone from the ground crew to guard the mic while everyone else hid in the plane. After about 2 hours of standing security showed up and then they cancelled the flight. Then we had to wait forever again at the ticket counter to receive a sheet of paper outlining what our options might be and we are still waiting for our baggage. There is zero communication, zero customer service, and to be honest their treatment is worse then nothing."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Columbus,June 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Columbus. Me and my wife had a early morning flight that was delayed by 8 hours. I was so upset because an 8 hour delay is absurd.To come to the realization that is was because of crew fatigue. I am more understanding than most so I thought. I don't want my pilot tired and not rested because I'd rather make it late and safe than not at all, but then following my 8 hour delay we were cancelled! Cancelled why? because you can't wake up the pilot? I have never used Frontier and I will never try again. Because of their mess me and my wife had to book 2 flights to Columbus a day later which was $460. After all the reviews read and 3 stars out of 10 I am surprised this company is able to continue to be in business after cancelling their flights! "

The lady was very rude and was using all types of excuses to not let us fly. I did all the early check ins even spent extra for the checked bag ahead of time, but it did not matter to this lady she even told us to just leave the bag and go. I had my wife crying next to me and the lady couldn't care less. I called customer service after she walked away from us and the could only give me credit for 90 days and at half the price i paid - and the flight was delayed 2 hours and they still couldn't board us."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Ontario,June 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Austin to Ontario. Got to the airport to return home and was waiting to board. Of the 200 passengers waiting someone heard the counter help talking about how this flight was cancelled which started a lot of people being upset. This caused the counter help to have to tell everyone and the reason given was there was bad weather in Atlanta. I checked weather in Atlanta and found it was 72 degrees with a slight wind. Flight cancelled, lied to and not even offered some sort of incentive for the trouble, just on your own. When asked for a refund they said that will come around seven days from now, we dont have that kind of money here. Last minute flights were 1000 dollars which was unacceptable, so we stayed another night which was a loss of work, rescheduling transportation and expense of a hotel room. Some were in tears and the employees could care less. I know some people did not have the money on them for another day but like I said the employees could care less. I will never use Frontier Airlines again, I might have have loss my trip home but Frontier lost a customer for good."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Phoenix via Denver,June 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Washington to Phoenix via Denver. I had heard that Frontier Airlines had a poor record for on-time flights, but was able to get a good discount on tickets for 5 people. Not worth it to save $750. We had delays on both legs of our trip, lies, different stories on reason for delay, 8 gate changes. An entirely frustrating experience, which caused us to arrive five hours late in PHX. My husband, my children and I were exhausted. We ended up easily spending the $750 that we saved on tickets on cabs, food and entertainment in airport, and most of all frustration. Do not go for the cheap flight, you WILL regret it. I spoke with at least seven different people who were flying Frontier for the first time last night, all said they will never use this airline again. They sent us a $25 discount each on any flight via email, but I will never use the discounts. You get what you pay for."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Cincinnati,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Phoenix to Cincinnati. Terrible airline experience. Arrived at airport at 0745, email at 0752 informed us that our flight was delayed over 5 hours. No reason given. Personnel sent to handle the questions were young, seemed inexperienced, and not helpful. Meal vouchers given out after mealtimes, I.e. Breakfast vouchers given at 10 am, lunch vouchers at 1:10 pm. Vouchers inadequate to buy a meal in the airport. Once flight left (over 5 hours late) personnel in the plane ignored the fact that the flight had been delayed over 5 hours and acted as if all were fine. Worst of all, when we got to Cincinnati the luggage was not on the belt for over 90 minutes. Over 100 people were waiting for luggage, and when passengers and airport personnel tried to find any employee from Frontier none could be found in the airport. Passengers became so angry police had to be called to quiet the scene. Unbelievable that with the delays no Frontier airline employee could be found. This airline stinks, not worth the savings."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Orlando,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Detroit to Orlando. This is the worst airline ever. Every flight I have ever taken with Frontier has been delayed for over 4 hours.  Last November my family planned a trip to Miami, however before we could make it to Florida our flight was delayed 8 hours! I vowed to never fly Frontier again. We were given $150 voucher to fly with this airline again. We reluctantly purchased another ticket with our vouchers. What a mistake! We should have learned from the first experience. When we arrived to the airport, we received a text message stating, ‘Travel Alert!! Frontier flight 1669 leaving from Detroit is delayed. Departure now estimated at 15:21”. We were delayed 3 times for 3 hours! And now, as I sit waiting for my 2 hour delayed flight, I cross my fingers hoping I don’t have to spend the rest of the day being disappointed by this subpar airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Cleveland. This airline is unprofessional, incompetent, and really should be looked at closer by officials. Drove from Tallahassee, FL (4.5 hrs) to Orlando to catch a flight with my 14 yr old son. Flight was delayed 5.5 hours due to a broken part on the plane that needed to be fixed. Scheduled to land at 7:22 pm in Cleveland, but ended up landing at 12:30 am. Then, 4 days later, I drive from Cleveland to Columbus (1.5 hrs) to catch flight back to Orlando only to be told when I arrived that my flight was canceled and “sorry”. I was handed a piece of paper and was told good luck. I asked what I should do and the lady looked over at the other airlines and said “ go see if any of them have a flight for you”. Didn’t offer to help me, didn’t offer to look to see if there were any other flights available. Nothing. I call customer service to get refund, and the rep could’ve cared less about my dilemma. I usually do not take the time to write reviews unless it’s a stellar one, but In this case, I feel it is necessary to add to the rest of these unfortunate stories. Will never fly this airline again. I truly believe they should be shut down. For good. For everyone’s sake."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Las Vegas,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  St Louis to Las Vegas. I had a trip planned to Vegas for my birthday, waited at the airport over 3 delays only for them to cancel the flight at 8:00 pm (we were supposed to board at 8:15). When I called customer service while waiting behind at least 200 people at the gate. I was offered no options to fly to Vegas for 2 More days (as we were told was the earliest flight available) despite my asking for any airport in a 5 hour drive radius so that I didn’t lose all the other money on shows, hotel, etc. They offered zero support through other airlines and literally repeatedly read from a script. I asked for a supervisor Restated the same phrase over again. It is completely unacceptable to make someone wait for 2 days to get to their destination and offer nothing but a refund (or the next available flight 2 days later - the day of our return!)- which doesn’t help because every other airlines quadrupled their prices to get a ticket the following day. Not at all a comparable consideration. I have never experienced such unacceptable treatment from any other airline I’ve ever used. Ultimately, after much discussion and begging, we were given flights at an airport 7.5 hours of a drive away so drove overnight, booked another hotel, to again try to leave tomorrow afternoon. Unfortunately, my Vegas hotel and show will not be refunded the night of due to No notice and we will also have to book an additional hotel room in Vegas as well. I have lost over $500 by trying to fly with this airline. I would think at minimum they could utilize other airlines to assist you to get to the destination sooner than 2 days! I’m so disappointed and disheartened."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,  Chicago to Orlando. Flights both ways were delayed over 2 hours. Frontier has the most uncomfortable seats I have  sat in as they are a piece of metal with cheap plastic over it. The tray tables are the size of my hand which means nothing can be fit on there. The flight attendants were more than rude the whole trip. To top it all off when I got my bag from bag claim it was covered in honey. Yes my bag was drenched in honey and the clothes on the inside were ruined as was the luggage. Frontier said just said “sorry” and they couldn’t do anything. My luggage was ruined because of someone else’s negligence. Cheap and horrible customer service. Do not ever take this airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Seattle via Denver,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Seattle via Denver. I had a flight planned a week in advance. They changed my booking on me at the last second without me even realizing thankfully I checked a day before I was supposed to go because my original flight was at 7am from Orlando to Denver then my final destination Seattle. I got a new email without my consent or knowledge that my new route would take me out at 5:15pm and I would arrive at the same time as originally scheduled. Fine. If that was the case - it wasn’t. I now had another stop in new Mexico and every stop including the one leaving the airport from Orlando was delayed an hour or more. When I got to New Mexico first they weren’t able to get the machine that connects to the plane and allows you to get off or board to work so I was sitting in the plane for an hour waiting for that to be fixed before they finally said they couldn’t fix it and was just going to tow the plane to a new gate. When we got to the new gate they then said they had a mechanical issue and had to have a mechanic come and check it out. Took 3 hours to fix. When we finally were able to board the plane they weren’t able to just scan our passes and let us on after this huge inconvenience (probably because we were at a jetblue gate or the scanner was broken) no they had to speak with a Frontier representative over the phone and one by one call the name of the person and make sure they were allowed to be on the plane. Added another hour just to board. When we finally did board and everything was good to go, I got to Denver 2 hours behind schedule and missed my flight to Seattle. In New Mexico I addressed this issue and they couldn’t refund me the full amount for the ticket out there I would have to wait until I got to Denver and was only able to reschedule me for 2 days out when I had already payed for a hotel and a rental service out in Seattle. They Didn’t care was quite nasty with me and gave me a 10$ meal voucher and a 25$ voucher off my next flight. To make things worse after 30 mins of arguing back and forth I said screw it I’ll just buy another plane ticket don’t touch my reservation leave it how it is I’ll figure this out later. When I get to Denver and ask about my itinerary they changed my reservation for the second time and weren’t even able to give me my return flight back to Orlando because my seat had been filled because some idiot can’t understand blatant English so I had To return on a Friday instead of a Thursday and come back one day late From my trip. They do not care about their customers they are a cheap airline with cheap business practices you may have one or 2 good flights but I can promise paying an extra 100$ is worth not having to deal with the problems this airline will put you through when they mess up."

My sister and I bought these tickets to fly back and see friends whom we had moved away from. My friends mom drove us two and half hours to the airport and when we got there, it was just delayed. Then, after two hours of waiting, they canceled the flight with no reason. My parents waited two and a half hours to talk to anyone and when they finally did talk to someone they were told the earlier flight they could get us was 5 days away. Then insurance (which we purchased) could only get us food and hotel stay. However, hotels would not let us stay since were are 15 and 13. My parents had to purchase same day tickets from Delta to get us home. It has been great with Delta, but we will never fly Frontier again."

Worst travel experience I've had in over 40 years of travel. Purchased round trip tickets. Both legs had huge delays which we not communicated in advance Customers service reps are poorly trained, surly and were of no help. Had to demand they check my bags so that I wasn't stuck waiting in the departure area that had limited seating and no amenities. Reason given for the delay both times was that they did not have a crew available. Isn't that how to run an airline? Schedule a flight and have a crew seems to be basic. Lost out on business both ways due to their delays and they could not care less."

We had never flown Frontier until recently - their prices were so good, why not give them a try? Our trip back home to Orlando from Columbus started off well enough. We checked in for our flight the day before, arrived 2.5 hours early, got to our gate and that's when it started. A supervisor walked up to the few of us that were at the gate and informed us that our flight had been canceled. They offered to put us on another flight - two days later (there seems to be a trend here, based on the other reviews). He handed us a piece of paper, instructed us to follow the directions in order to file a claim, and said, ""Sorry.. I don't have any other information."" We got to the Frontier ticket counter. There were two young ladies there, who instructed us to go get another ticket on another airline. Other airlines would try to help their customers secure alternate travel plans. After running from counter to counter (with options ranging as high as $800 per person), we secured two tickets for +$453 each. I would mention Frontier's poor customer service, only there wasn't any... zip! We will never, ever do business with this airline again. I urge you to bypass this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Raleigh,June 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,2,"  On Sat, June 16: My family had a 6:30AM flight for our long-awaited vacation. We arrived at the airport at 4:50AM, 20 min behind the recommended 2 hour window. We got in line at the Frontier Ticket area to check-in at 5:20AM (Still 1hr 10min before our flight). There were about 200 customers checking in & only two attendants. We got to the front of the line at 5:52AM (38 min before departure). Frontier stops accepting baggage 45 min before departure. We were 7 minutes late, even though we were in their line the whole time. Frontier had no available seats on any other flights from anywhere in TX until Monday. To maintain our vacation plans, we bought 1-way tickets on a different airline. I called Frontier's rep today (10 days later) to discuss a partial refund. The rep recited their policy, saying they are under no obligation to help us. ""Even if the flight we offer is a month later, if you refuse it, we offer no refunds."" He also said he refused, because I was calling so later after the fact. (I explained that we did not call while on the vacation, and this was the first chance since our return.) He refused to refund the $76 in pre-purchased baggage fees, even though they never touched our bags. Bottom Line: Frontier strips their services to the bare bones to ""save you money."" They do not care about their customers and will do nothing to help. I highly recommend against any families or businesses using their services, because there will be no flexibility when life happens."

The fasten seatbelt was on but very little turbulence if any was going on when I took my son to the restroom. Now I am afraid of heights and flying and I was just fine walking to the back of the plain. When I got back there the flight attendant was standing in front of the restroom. I said my son needs to use the bathroom. She said didn’t you see the fasten seatbelt is on and that he had to wait. I said he is autistic and also has irritable bowl syndrome he can’t wait. She chuckled at her coworker and said we needed to return to our seat. Not a laughing matter in my mind but I did return to my seat. 25 minutes went by my son in excruciating pain was yelling and screaming that he needed to use the bathroom. 35 min later the flight attendant approached me and said you can take him at your own risk. Well if she would’ve said that in the beginning it wouldn’t have been an issue but to put my son through this pain, think of his medical issues a laughing matter is definitely something that is a problem. I filed a complaint over two weeks ago and I am still awaiting a response from upper management. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cincinnati,June 2018,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," First and foremost I want to say that I will never fly with this airline again. Myself, along with 2 other adults, a 1 year old and 5 year old were supposed to board our plane to Cincinnati at 8.10pm. Around 3 or 4 we received a text message stating that our flight would be delayed until 1.00am. No information on why. Maybe a hour or so later, we received another text that said our flight was pushed back an extra 41 minutes. My family and I decided to go to the airport at 6.30pm, check our lungage in, and simply just wait until it was time to board our flight. After sitting there for about 3 and a half hours we looked up at the board and seen that the status of our flight had went from delayed to cancelled. No alerts, no announcements, and no words from anyone from Frontier on what we should do next. After finally speaking with two female representatives we were told that there would be no food or hotel accommodations and that the only thing they could offer us was up to a 400 dollar reimbursement if we booked another flight only. No mention of getting a refund on the flight that was cancelled. The next available flight to Cincinnati would be on Tuesday which is two days away. After complaining for quite sometime, we were finally offered one 15 dollar food voucher for 3 adults and two children. I am typing this as we load into a rental car at 4.00am, to make this 13 hour drive back home. I know things happen, but the customer service we experienced yesterday sucked. I would not recommend this airline to anyone."

As soon as I got through security I got a text that my flight was delayed 1 hour. Went to the gate to board and we got on the plane, sat there for an hour and then were told we had to get off and the flight was delayed until 5pm. At 5 we all showed up at the gate and the airport screen said flight was canceled. The ladies at the desk said they didn't know and no one got email, or texts. After a while they confirmed it was canceled and they could rebook or refund the tickets. They did refund me the tickets but when I asked for my money back for my luggage they said they couldn't that I had to contact the airlines. I have been trying to contact the airlines and all I get is an automated system that doesn't give me the option for luggage refund. Next flight is in 5 days. My husband and I need to get back to work, They claimed this was due to weather. There were three other flights to the same location that took off from the airport that day. I also know that the airport I was going to was landing flights all day. It was not the weather. Also, because it was canceled due to weather we don't get any compensation. So we have to drive an hour to get back. Don't get fooled by the cheap prices it's better to pay more than go through all this pain."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Puerto Rico,June 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,5.0,4,yes,6," For a short trip like the one from Miami to Puerto Rico, it's fine. On a flight of less than three hours, with free water is enough. The seats do not lean back, but for a short trip this is ok. If you pay for the luggage when you are booking: the value of the suitcase is $35, if you pay one day later it is $38 and if you pay at the airport it is $40. If you make a mistake in the name and want to rectify it, it's $38. I recommend that you focus a lot on the size of the equipment and the weight, I did it, and it went well. The Frontier App is very good. The plane was clean, the flights back and forth was on time. It was my first experience with them.."

I did actually get into the air last year with them, worst flight of my life, said I would never do it again. Next time I will listen to my own advice. You might get a low fare, but after fees and such, that is the end of savings. Truly bottom of the barrel.  I demanded a full refund, and now I am in the process of canceling all my mileage and other membership. Horrible, horrible airline!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Savannah,June 2018,,,,,,,2,no,1,  Denver to Savannah. It’s nice to save a little money but it’s such a gamble to fly Frontier and not worth the money you save. They cancelled our flight with zero notice or reason. Waited on hold for 1.5 hours and they said it would be 4 days until they could fly us out. Are you kidding me Frontier?  Most pathetically ran airline in the United States who is full of nothing but excuses. 
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Orlando,June 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Planned a trip for my family from St Louis to Orlando. The flight was scheduled for 4 pm. at noon we got our first text stating the flight was delayed an hour. After 3 more texts the flight was finally set for 930 pm. We drive to the airport and wait the two hours only to find out from another passenger that they had already canceled the flight. Now at this point the poor woman at the desk states, she wasn't told about the cancellation, and she was just as upset that they refused to tell her. She then stated they only fly out of St Louis once per day, and the next two days had no seats available. She also said 7 other flights were canceled that same day. I can understand if it was an ""act of god situation"". But the weather across the us is clear to fly today. So now i have to cancel, disney world, the hotel, the car, the trip to nasa, and burned through a week of vacation time. All because this airline can't even get planes in the air. Please spend the money and go with a reputable airline. We only picked this horrible airline because g-ma wanted to take the family on a trip and pay for it. Now i get to make all these phone calls at 1130 at night. Never again with this joke of a company."

The latest was delayed by over 3 hours with little to no communication as to what was going on or when we would be able to depart. Uncomfortable seats, zero hospitality with food/beverage, no outlets or in flight entertainment. Yes, it's simply just a ticket, but you get what you pay for and these flights aren't enough less than full-service airlines to merit this low quality."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Las Vegas,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Don't fly this airline! I used to always fly Frontier Airlines and I loved it. Well I had a surprise wedding anniversary trip to Vegas planned, but Frontier had other plans. We flew from San Antonio to Colorado (where our layover was) and as we sat on the plane waiting to take off the crew got on the intercom to tell us the flight was cancelled because the pilot timed out. We get off the plane and they tell us there are no flights to Vegas and pretty much we are stuck here and we are on our own in Colorado Springs. Well, just our luck, there is a golf tournament going on here and there are no hotel rooms available. If you want to rent a car the car rental company is gonna charge you $700 to rent their cheapest car. So, I write this as I'm getting ready to sleep in the airport and wait for my flight back home tomorrow afternoon (which I had to pay for out of my pocket). Pay the extra cash and fly with another airline. Worst experience of my life."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Philadelphia,June 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  I paid for two tickets for direct flights from Cancun to Philadelphia for myself and my 11 year old son. We were supposed to board the plane at 2:07pm. We received notification of the first delay via email at 2:02pm, with a new boarding time of 4:26pm. Mind you, the airport board was never updated, and we relying on information that was coming through via email using cellular data. Since we arrived at the airport around noon, and anticipated arriving to Philadelphia for a late dinner, we decided to have a late lunch / early dinner at the airport ($35 for sandwiches and two soft drinks) prior to boarding. We received a new update via email at 2;57pm pushing our departure a little further to 4:59pm. At 3:37pm, we received another plane, via email (no announcement, not an update on the flight status board in the airport) that our direct flight was now pushed to 5:44pm. At this point, we began asking questions to the Frontier Airline EMPLOYEES at the airport, and they were not able to provide any information. One of the other passengers overheard that the plane needed to stop in Miami for water, but that was all we knew. At 4:27pm, we received another email that our flight was pushed to 6:44pm. This was getting a bit concerning because of the time that we would return to Philadelphia. We then received another update via email that the flight was further delayed with a 7:22pm departure time. At 5:25pm, we received an email notification apologizing for the inconvenience and to pick up a meal voucher at the Frontier departure gate. When we went to the gate, we were told that thy did not yet have vouchers. There was apparently a gate change which, again, was not updated on the board, and about an hour later, the vouchers were then available. $15 per person. I thought I could get my son chicken tenders, fries and a water, however, $15 was not enough for him and I paid an additional $10 for his dinner. Some restaurants at the airport refused to accept the voucher. Meanwhile, we received another email notification at 6:15pm that the flight was again delayed with a new departure time of 8pm. At this point, the flight board was updated, and our direct flight from Cancun to Philadelphia displayed as a flight from Cancun to Orlando. After myself, and several other passengers questioned this, we were told lies and told that the board was just a mistake, and we would arrive in Philadelphia a little after midnight. When finally boarding the plane, 5 hours later, we heard commotion ahead at the gate where one of the flight agents expressed that we were going to Orlando. This caused some additional confusion and commotion. Once seated, the captain came on the speaker to “clear up confusion” and told the passengers that we were in fact stopping in Orlando prior to going to Philadelphia, and if we didn’t like it, this was our chance to get off the plane and figure out other arrangements. Then this person continued to first say that the delays were first due to a medical issue. He then changed the story, stating that this was due to a mechanical issue, which really upset my son to the point he was now scared, crying, and very upset. Upon arriving in Orlando, we were told that they didn’t know whether or not we needed to deplane. We went through customs, and again through security, having to discard our drinks. We boarded the same plane, arriving in Phila after 3am."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Denver,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Minneapolis to Denver. We have had hands down the worst travel experience for what was meant to be a spectacular vacation to Denver. Please see below for a timeline of events. -Email and text notification of flight delay at 5:47am day of flight. Prompted an immediate call to Frontier 5:47am. Representative notes flight delayed until 5:45pm same day. They stated that they could not get us on another flight with any other airline as Frontier is not affiliated with any other airlines. Called Just Fly twice 6:00am, 7:41am, (where tickets were booked through) with no answer-hold time of over 40 minutes each call. Went to the airport for in person service. 7:09am Gate rep stated flight was being delayed due to mechanical issues until 5:45pm - that an email or text will go out of the flight will be moved up earlier in the day. Email received from Frontier as leaving airport w/flight voucher for ""inconvenience"", no mention of flight cancellation 7:47am - flight vouchers are both invalid. Call to Frontier made at 12:03pm to ask for update as we had not received any texts, calls, or emails on status update. Was told by rep flight has been cancelled until the following day. Rep noted that they could get us on a same day flight to Colorado Springs with a 1.5 hour drive to Denver which would depart MPLS at 6:10pm. Frontier rep took all of my information, puts me on hold, comes back to tell me that “unfortunately, that was only for one person. We cannot get you both on this flight. You will have to wait until tomorrow at 11:45am to depart.” We had planned this trip months in advance (in February), and were traveling to Red Rocks Amphitheater for 2 concerts, where we had purchased the VIP experience for. If we waited until the next day, we would miss the show. Called Just Fly 12:21pm to discuss option to book with another airline. They could not refund our flight. My friend called on her phone to Frontier to cancel our flight so we could get out on any other airline same day through. Just Fly with American Airlines. Her call was made at 12:35pm. Frontier offered us a refund for the flight that they cancelled with no mention of a cancellation fee. Frontier charged a cancellation fee via email at 12:45pm, and another at 1:35pm on a flight that Frontier cancelled. New flight with American Airlines was booked via phone through Just Fly via a frustrating phone call with a representative that could not speak English. The cost of the flight which now was departing at 6:21pm, arriving to Dallas Fort Worth at 8:59pm, with an hour and a half layover, had us departing from Dallas at 10:25pm and arriving in Denver at 11:29pm. We did not arrive to our hotel via an Uber until 1am. The cancelled flight also cancelled our car rental reservation, which we then had to rebook on Friday 6/15 through Hotwire.com, as every rental company in the area was sold out due to a hail storm in the area on Wednesday. The extremely long travel day, lack of communication and follow through with Frontier absolutely ruined our trip. We spent the next 2 days completely exhausted, sore, and jet lagged, not to mention unable to spend money saved for our vacation as it was spent to rebook through another airline."

I pen this review as I sit on the floor trying to charge my phone in a waiting area where I must spend the night! My flight was canceled due to weather; oh well, that happens, I know. However, zero accommodations were provided. I no know one in Tulsa on whom I can call so I have to spend he night here. We haven't even been told when our new flight will be tomorrow - it could be as early as seven or as late as noon. Meanwhile this ridiculous airport closes at ten. As such, literally every concession closes at nine, right about the time we were notified of our flight cancellation.  When I called Frontier to complain, I was told to get something from a vending machine! The airline has offered absolutely nothing for our inconvenience. They could have at least ordered pizza and had it delivered here so that we could have something decent to eat. There are people here with young children. And Frontier charges extra for everything -- checked bags, carry on, soda, snacks. I will never fly Frontier again!"

My friend referred Frontier Airlines and what a terrible mistake. I not only had to reprint my ticket at the gate, I had to wait about 20 minutes after everyone has boarded the plane to check in a bag. No courtesy bag? 60$ at that. Not to mention I did notice online that there was a charge for baggage but never did I think it would be a carry on/ personal bag. The staff was horrible. They kept bouncing me from gate to gate. This held up the plane from taking off after the fact. Once boarded the captain tells us that they can’t take off because the airplane had maintenance work done “preventative work” which God only knows what that means. Waiting to take off. Furious, irritated and well beyond my patience limit with that entire experience. At this point anything is better then frontier airlines."

We were additionally delayed on the tarmac and during the flight, again with minimal communication from the attendants as to why we were delayed or when we would be departing/arriving. In the air, we circled the Denver airport for almost 30 minutes in extreme turbulence and was not notified why or when the flight would land.

I had to get a babysitter for my 3 kids 4 and under due to this. Then, our flight was delayed twice the time was pushed later and later. My mom and I flew in for a conference in SLC. This caused so much stress and exhaustion when we had to be up extremely earlier the next morning for our business conference. Headed home- SLC- DENVER... our flight changed again.

It wasn’t u til 5 PM that we were told that our flight would be delayed again until 6 PM as an estimate. No communication to a whole plane of customers.

There are more than 100 people trying to reach their destination but they have to stay in airport the whole night. When asked for hotel they said to find on our own. $200 compensation in voucher to travel in this mess next time. I will ask people to pay a bit more and use other airlines than to use this airline.

It took over an hour to check my bags, only reason I actually caught my flight was because I arrived over 2 hours early. I great number of individuals did not catch their flights. That was only the beginning. Once we all boarded the plane we were informed that it would be a half hour before we could depart since the baggage had not been delivered to the aircraft yet.. The captain was able to make up the lost time in the air, looked like our issues were solved and then as we are above Minneapolis we were informed that there was heavy air traffic. So we had to circle above minneapolis for an hour until we were given the go ahead. At last we landed and arrived at our gate. After sitting at the gate for 10 minutes the captain informed us that the gate is closed for maintenance and we need to find a gate, but nobody was picking up on the other end of the radio. No time phrame could be provided for a new gate. I am still waiting on the plane to find a gate, without any air conditioning. A tragic display of transportation through and through."

We were scheduled to leave SLC on 6-10-18 at 11:15am on Flight 578 to DEN. We were to then board Flight 638 to PEN. Upon arrival we were informed that our flight was delayed for mechanical issues. This delay meant that we missed our connecting flight in PEN and next available would be Wed. After alerts that our flight would not leave until 6.5 hrs after initial plan, we changed our return route. We had to rent a hotel for an extra night in SLC and arrive (via Uber) at airport early the next day. Boarded flight and notice the flight attendants discusses improper filing for an unaccompanied minor. A signature was not properly done, and the attendant shrugged it off with a look of “oh well” and signed her name. Landed in DEN and slept in the airport as best we could due to a long layover. Boarded and flew to AUS and had another long layover. Boarded our last flight and flew to MSY where we had to rent a vehicle and drive three hours to PEN where our personal vehicle was parked. Proceeded to have to drive an additional hour to get home. Terrible experience. Cheap flights (until they nickel and dime you for carry ons and sodas), no entertainment, first four rows recline, trays are tiny, and staff is negligent. Don’t expect anything that resembles customer service."

When we asked so what do we do for 3 days the desk attendant told us to sleep in the airport. The police were called when some of the stranded passengers got loud because they were frustrated.  When asked could they take us to another airport in NY (LGA OR JFK) they said they don’t do that.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Bozeman,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I showed up two hours before my flight to drop off my bag, and there were no employees at the counter. For over half an hour. The entire plane was lined up out there, and the counter was empty. The flight to Denver (my only stop) was delayed two hours. Then three. Then five. Again, there was no employee at the gate, so we had no one to answer our questions or help us adjust our connections. Some superhero of a passenger tried every number on the website until she found a human, and that was the only way we knew that the delay was caused by mechanical problems with the plane in Denver.  Since there was no employee at the gate and I would definitely be missing my connection to Montana, I, too, decided to call every number on the webpage. And waited on hold for an hour. When I finally reached a human, they told me that they couldn’t get me on a new flight to Bozeman until three days later (which would be the day after the wedding I was traveling to attend!) An employee finally appeared at the gate four hours into this ordeal. She told me that even though I had missed my connection and been stuck for hours in my home airport due to a mechanical issue with their plane, their company policy did not permit them to book me a new flight to Bozeman through another airline unless I paid the difference (which came to $400).  I was the only person on this flight that was going to Bozeman, so they weren’t too concerned about making me happy. They told me that they would refund my one-way flight and give me a $100 Frontier voucher for my troubles, but the rest (car, hotel, and return flight) was my problem, as was the cost of a new flight if I decided to book with another airline. Again, due to an issue with their plane that was causing me to miss my trip. After ugly crying in the airport for an hour, I decided this trip was too important to miss, so I sucked it up and bought the expensive and inconveniently long next-day flight to my destination. A decent airline would never put their customer in this position. Thanks a lot, Frontier Airlines - you are the absolute worst."

They need to sell their fleet of 76 planes and save all these travelers who have suffered due to this company being incompetent. I have had 2 back to back trips from San Jose to Texas and both have been delayed 5 hours plus. Then they hand you a “we are sorry for the inconvience so here’s a big $10 food voucher to use in airport” really, $10? What can you buy at a airport for $10? Nobody with this company cares about the customer. I only wish I would have read the reviews before booking. Pay attention, do something, it starts at the top! Employees spend all day apologizing to upset travelers, is that what they signed up for? Do you care about them? Travelers, stay away, don’t do it, spend a little more. This is where that good ole saying “you get what you pay for” ha! I seriously want a refund and not a $10 food voucher please!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Denver to San Diego,June 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," This is my first and certainly my last flight with Frontier Airlines. Yesterday flight from San Diego to Denver was delayed a few times, consequently I had 3 hours of sleep last night and am now sitting in Denver airport, flight back home is again delayed. No announcements being made as least to give updates except the short initial one with reference to ""aircraft maintenance"". Terrible service, praying that I arrive safe home."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Salt Lake City to Grand Rapids, Michigan",June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flew Frontier Airlines from Salt Lake City to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Rude. Boarded 35 mins late. Get on the plane, sit there 40 mins. Then they make us check a bag below when this very bag has been on 8 of their flights in the last 6 months. Further, they measured my bag and said it was fine size for a carry on. Then, they make the entire plane deboard. Now we are 1.5 hours late and waiting. This is unreal. The staff are so rude. They make you pay for a soda, after all the add ons you've paid double the ticket cost. They lost my business today. On the way to my moms funeral. Nice!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Austin,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,  San Jose to Austin. Flight was delayed over 5 hours. I was not notified. Multiple delays and still have not received any updates from frontier. Sent a facebook message and they said they are sorry lol!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Dallas,June 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," The first part of my trip was pretty smooth. Left an hour late from Denver which was my connecting flight location. No biggie since i was told it was for routine maintenance inspection. My flight home was a nightmare. Scheduled to leave at 11:15am to Denver then delayed 2 hrs, then another 2 hours, the next another 2 1/2 hrs final departure at 545pm. However during the first notifications of delays there was no one at the gate desk to provide food vouchers as indicated in the emails. Hours after our plane was to leave they showed up. I will give them credit that they were nice but not very knowledgeable. My flight from Denver to DFW was also delayed 3 hrs and that when I decided I wasn’t going to sit in an airport for 15 hrs and arrive home at 3am on a Monday morning. After waiting in line for an hour and half spoke to the gate agent who didn’t know my Denver flight had also been delayed and basically told her what I wanted and which flights for the next day (I didn’t my own research). She made that happen even tho one fligt showed booked. FYI my flight the following day was also delayed 35 min leaving salt lake. No compensation at all. I will never fly Frontier airlines again."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Raleigh,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Cincinnati to Raleigh. Got to the airport 2 hours before flight for a 1:25pm flight. Got to the gate 1 hour prior to flight. Gate said flight was delayed. Checked Frontier app, app confirmed delayed and said 2:53pm right next that. Left gate to get some food and looked around the shop right next to the gate. Got back to the gate at 1:25 pm and the gate was empty and the airplane was backing up. Contact customer service immediately about my baggage that was on the flight. They told me that they would have it sent back to Cincinnati the following day. Even called and confirmed that the bag was on the flight. Went to pick up the bag at Cincinnati and they said they never received it. Now it’s been nearly a week and my bag is still missing. They can’t even get a hold of the airports Frontier baggage people to find out if it’s in Cincinnati or Raleigh."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Denver to Cancun,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Terrible experience all the way around. Frontier Airlines are so dishonest. The seats are terrible and crowded, staff beyond rude. The cost of flight tickets doubled by the time I paid for carry on baggage (yes you have to pay to carry on anything), paid to sit next to my young children. Ridiculous. We were stuck sitting on the runway for hours, wouldn't let us off the plane, it was so awful. We lost an entire day of vacation, no compensation whatsoever. I will never fly Frontier again, and would tell anyone I know to do the same."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to San Diego,March 2018,,,,,,,1,no,1, I booked a ticket for October from Colorado Springs to San Diego. 3 weeks later I received an email saying my itinerary changed. I needed to rebook because Frontier stopped this service. My ticket was non and void. Now I have to go through Denver. Thank you frontier for the inconvenience of not servicing all the customers in Colorado springs. I was given a voucher for 100.00 that needs to be booked in 90 days. WOW! What happened to booking in a year With a voucher? Our city is big enough to support the service but this inconvenience is it really worth ticking off Colorado springs?
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham,June 2018,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,5,no,1,  Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham. Very disappointed with the airline from the start. Departing flight was delayed and they gave me a $25 voucher to “make up” for it. Flight back home was cancelled! At first it kept getting delayed (twice) and then I received notification that it was cancelled and had to wait until the next day. They gave me a $200 voucher for that. Please be wary of scheduling this airline for your travels.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Phoenix,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Philadelphia to Phoenix. The worst airline and customer service ever. I bought my ticket since January for two people and it's suppose to be nonstop but they changed in the last minute to connect with Cincinnati. Because of connecting in short hours we get there on time but they board everyone early and close the door however the plane is still there. No one is willing to helping us in or rebook the flight. So me and my husband have to spend extra $1782 to go to phoenix because of their irresponsible service.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Tampa,June 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I live 4 hours away from Denver and arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the flight was to leave. During check-in I was informed that the flight has been delayed 50 minutes, Okay. We went through security and stopped at the gate indicated. His flight was delayed again by two hours and then the flight was cancelled. We had to stand in line at the gate podium to receive food vouchers for Breakfast and Dinner for the following day, because the flight was rescheduled for 24 hours after the original flight. Once we received the voucher we were told to go to the information desk to receive our hotel voucher if we did not live in the area. After waiting in line I was told since I lived in the same state, I would not be receiving a voucher. I ended up purchasing a hotel room with my own money so I didn't have to drive eight hours to make sure my son caught his flight. The next morning I looked at the Departing flight for Denver and there were none to Tampa for Frontier. Throughout that day we had multiple gate changes, but the big kicker was that there were four flights that were suppose to be going out of the last gate at the same time. They did not change any of the visual aids so people thought that the either Boise or Bismark were leaving out of the gate. Since no one knew what was going on they ended up standing in line at the podium. Since I had an unaccompanied minor I am required to let the gate attendant know. I stood in line and when I was next up the attendant just left the podium and began doing pre-boarding tasks with a line still at the podium. When I saw two other unaccompanied minor being led onto the plane I ran to the gate to let him know that my kid also was one. He got angry at me because I didn't inform him earlier.  I have had rude gate attendants every time I have flown with Frontier and I will not fly with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Philadelphia,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flight was delayed,but airline did not update airport boards, provide email or text notification, or gate announcement, until after the flight was scheduled to depart. New departure time was 3.5 hours later and gate attendant admitted that they knew this a hour in advance. So they trap hundreds of passengers inside an expensive terminal for 3 hours plus. No apologies. Terrible customer service. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Seattle,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Grand Rapids to Seattle. This is the first and absolute last time I would ever use this airline. It is truly amazing they are still running with all of the money they must lose through providing vouchers. 3 out of our 3 flights had delays or some other issue, then at the last destination our baggage was lost. They do not provide any sort of tracking for your baggage and also are unable to provide you with any solid information about where it is until they speak with another agent. I have dealt with poor airlines before and I understand you usually get what you pay for, but you don’t even get that with Frontier. Customer service agents were edgy and rude, treating us like we inconvenienced them. It was just unacceptable to see people treat their customers that way when they were just trying to figure out a plan. I am not someone to write reviews, but this was truly a shocking experience that this airline is still functioning this way. Also I wanted to share in hopes that someone who has never used this airline and is considering it due to the lower cost, I highly recommend you do not unless you have flexible travel dates and no checked bags. I absolutely understand things go wrong during travel but I was just so put off by the treatment of customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Chicago,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Denver to Chicago. Worst airline I've ever flown with. We were lied to all day about why our flight was delayed. After leaving an hour late they spent 30 minutes harassing us about their awful credit card. We landed and were not let off the plane. They told us we would land around 3pm, then they flew around in for an extra hour with out informing us what was going on. Once we landed they told us we would sit for an extra 15 minutes becaise they forgot to move a plane from our gate. Worst experience ever."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Austin ,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Minneapolis to Austin. My husband was set to fly from MSP and arrive in AUS around 1pm on Friday, June 1. They canceled his flight that morning with no explanation. Then when asked they said it was ""environmental damage"". I sat on the phone with Frontier customer service for 70 minutes. They could not explain what environmental damage was nor would they put him on another airline at their expense. The best they could do was offer a flight to arrive on Saturday (the following day) at 4pm. Unacceptable! He needed to be in Austin Friday night at the latest. So we ended up having to pay over 3x the cost to book on a different airline that day. They totally screwed us over and in trying to save money we ended up paying almost $500 to get him to and from AUS just for the weekend. Never again Frontier. (Management was supposedly going to call me but they never did. Worst service ever.) I wish I could give Frontier a 0/10."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Denver via Chicago,June 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  I flew from Pensacola to Denver yesterday 6/6 and we were hit by lightning on the way down to layover, Chicago. I understand there were mechanical issues, but you should not hold families at airports for 5 hours. No voucher for food, no hotel vouchers and no available flights for 3 days. I had to spend over $1800 to get my family home. Horrible customer service. I will no longer use their service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Austin to Minneapolis,June 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,2,  Austin to Minneapolis. Most airlines will let you cancel your flight within 24 hours of purchase. My ticket was $155. They tried to charge me $99 to cancel. Then give me $56 I’m flight credit. My fault for booking them. I would avoid at all costs.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Denver,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Portland to Denver. Absolutely terrible. My flight was scheduled for 12:50am, but got delayed until 3:30am with no explanation. Then at the airport, myself and several others were sitting at a gate waiting for our flight, when a woman came and told us that there had been a gate change and we were sitting at the wrong gate. The ticketing agents did not announce the gate change until after we reached the correct gate. Then our plane arrived late. I then had a connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City. That flight also arrived late with no explanation. Honestly don’t know how this airline is still operating, it’s absolutely terrible!"
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Washington DC to Salt Lake City,June 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Washington DC to Salt Lake City. This is the worst airlines I have ever been on. Check in lines were so long because there was never any representatives available to help myself and others. Had my baggage lost by their crew, had to go the following day to pick up my luggage and they had me wait 4 hours. The reps were mediocre and understaffed. If they actually had reps available and if they were better trained, this airline would be alright, but until than this airline is horrible! I do not recommend this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to New York,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1," First and last time with Frontier Airlines. Over an hour delay, boarded and then sat on the plane for two hours to be told the mechanical issues could not be resolved and the flight was cancelled. Follow up customer service was absolutely horrible, the staff did not show a shred of compassion or any degree of descancey. Their phone support is definitely designed to make you want to hang up. This has been the absolute worst experience. The executive leadership and all staff should be ashamed of themselves. Moral of the story here is, you get what you pay for. If you relying on getting to your destination on time, this is not the airline for you. Never again. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Las Vegas,June 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Colorado Springs to Las Vegas. This is the 4th time I have flown Frontier and every single time it has been delayed. I understand things happen but 4/4 times I’ve flown with them there has been some sort of issue and the flight had been delayed at least an hour. Not only are the delays infuriating but they charge you for everything! Checked bags, carry on’s, drinks and snacks. You have lost a customer Frontier. Fix your issues."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Denver,June 2018,2.0,1.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  First and last time I will fly Frontier. I hesitantly booked a Frontier flight because it had an early, direct flight into Denver (was trying to get in as early as possible). 4 hrs before the flight early in the am I get a delay notification of 4 hrs (how are you planning on failure that far out? As soon as I get to the airport, another 2 hr delay. If you need to be somewhere on time, don’t use Frontier"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Chicago,June 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Jacksonville to Chicago. Flight was delayed, left and came back and waited in line for 10-15 minutes at the check in counter. Was charged $90 dollars to check two bags, then they told us we could not board because it was under 45 minutes (42) till flight left and per TSA they cant accommodate us less than 45 minutes before flight. We had a family event to get home for and they would not budge. We went to Southwest and they were sympathetic and got us home but 5.5 hours later and we missed the event. Come to find out after checking with TSA, the requirement is only 30 minutes therefore we had plenty of time and were misled by the check in staff including the manager. I have disputed the baggage charge with my credit card and they will not refund the ticket price for my wife and I but gave us a credit toward future flights. Does not make any difference as we will never fly with them again. I thought when I got home and called their customer service that we would have gotten a refund but seems this type of customer service is rooted in the company."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to New Orleans via Denver,June 2018,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Salt Lake City to New Orleans via Denver. Not only was the flight itself cramped and uncomfortable with no free drinks or snacks, but the bag check at the New Orleans airport was unattended for over half an hour. A huge line formed but still no one came to work the desk. If the airline is going to not only charge for checked bags but also overhead carry ons, at least provide basic services in a timely manner. Not worth a slightly lower price vastly inferior service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Atlanta,May 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Salt Lake City to Atlanta return flight from SLC to ATL delayed several times and finally cancelled on a Friday night 6/1/2018. No reason given for the cancellation. Next possible flight on Frontier to Atlanta was Monday 6/4. Only ticket available to get me home at a reasonable time was Southwest for $$357.80.and that would get me home 24 hours late. I booked this flight based on Frontier telling me there would be a $400 maximum allowance for my inconvenience. Today, June 5 I get notice of a $170.80 credit from Frontier. I call the customer service line and find out that I will only get the $170.80 because ""I requested a refund"". I did not request a refund. My focus was on getting home and deal with the expense later. The last time I flew Frontier, I swore never again, but the fare lured me in. This is it for me - never, never again. I will drive before I will ever get on a Frontier flight again. Everything about this entire trip was horrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Milwaukee,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Milwaukee. The staff was rude, unprofessional and badly dressed and staff representation of Frontier Airline was disgusting. The seats of the A321 were like sitting on bricks. There was no internet, no entertainment of any kind. You have to pay for everything including your carry-on baggage. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Austin,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Every single time I fly with Frontier we are delayed. It is the worst airline in trying to get somewhere on time! They have good prices some of the time. But I have 2 kids under 3, Being delayed over 3 hours when we got here 2 hours before our flight is no good! They did this to us on our way to our destination as well as going back home. I have no other words than do not fly them! Pay the extra money knowing you'll get to where you need to go on time! This was my last time flying with Frontier. They have lost myself, my family and friends as a customer. Very disappointed."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Orlando,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Birmingham to Orlando. This was my first time using Frontier. Our flight was delayed twice and then cancelled which is a headache, but not a big deal since we were flying out of the city that we live in. However, the way it was handled was awful. When they cancelled the flight there was no information (text or email) sent out about the cancellation until after they already announced what they were going to do to fix it. When they announced over the intercom the flight was cancelled, they said that they would pay for another flight out from another airline. However, they waited so long to tell us, there were no other flights out. They said we could cancel the flight and get a refund. However, its $25 charge when canceling over the phone and we have been waiting for an hour and 30 mins to get a refund. I don't mind waiting, but they have announced 6 times what they are going to do and have yet to help one person at the counter. I will not be using this airline again and was very disappointed in how things were handled."
❌ Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Miami,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Philadelphia to Miami. They are a kingdom of their own. They “bark” at customers rather than provide assistance. Did nothing to accommodate those traveling together. There was no organization whatsoever when checking in, signs for destination were chest high - obviously Frontier is unaware of technology like screens that are suspended from the ceiling that are visible to all. Paying for snacks and drinks. After the inconvenience of a delayed flight where Frontier repeatedly announced we would be boarding momentarily versus the text we received stating our flight was delayed an hour. Frontiers primary concern was to solicit their MasterCard - No Thanks!"
❌ Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Over 10 hour delay. I saw terrible reviews and ignored them. I am writing this as I am buying a $350 flight to get me from Houston to Denver 11 hours later than originally planned. I was scheduled to fly Frontier from Houston (IAH) at 5:11am. I received an email moments ago (4 hours before departure) completely cancelling my flight!! The careless email seems like they do it all the time, they just promised travel vouchers from their airline, as if I want to be stuck in the airport waiting on a flight to leave again. If Frontier is the only airline available to fly, rent a car and drive. I will never fly with them again this has been an extreme inconvenience and I am worried I will not even receive the refund that they claim they will issue."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Austin,June 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Minneapolis to Austin. Terrible! I was not notified my flight was canceled. After I got through security I checked my flight info via Google, I saw it was canceled. I went to the gate and found out the plane was still in Austin and couldn't fly since it was damaged - ""something hit it."" The agent said they could get me another flight on Sunday - today is Friday! So I had to scramble and pay $463 for an American Airlines flight instead. Terrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Utah,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Utah. I have never flown with this airline before, when I did it was my first time and it will be my last. I had a flight set for 5:15pm to leave Orlando FL (which got delayed to 6:00 then 7:00), and return to Salt Lake City Utah, when I got to the airport they had to delay my flight due to weather conditions and the plane having to land for gas. I had to catch a connecting flight in Denver which I missed because of the delayed flight in Orlando. My issue with this airline is one When I got to Orlando they offered to partially refund me my money which was not ok because it was not a full refund. Two most hotels will give you a FREE overnight stay in a hotel, instead they gave me some voucher where I can get a hotel but I would have to pay for it myself the rate would just be lower because of the voucher. They did not provide me with a food voucher either. My checked back was $40 and it was not overweight I paid online, you have to pay for snacks on board using a debit or credit card their is no entertainment as far as a screen on the back of your seat. A can soda is $2.99 and so are the snacks. While I was in Denver they had me on standby and I had to sleep in the airport overnight. I took this vacation on May 24,2018 flying with delta and was supposed to return on May 29,2018 but came back May 30, 2018 due to Frontier and their complications."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando,March 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Columbus to Orlando. Worst airline ever. They don't know the meaning of customer service. Flight was originally delayed 2 hours, then cancelled at the last min. I had a check in representative act like I was responsible for the flight being cancelled when I inquired about re-booking. I was given the run around for 2 hours. I finally got information on how to book with another carrier, only to have that flight cancelled. This is not how I wanted my first day of vacation to begin."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Salt Lake City,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Chicago to Salt Lake City. I have flown with Frontier for years, usually because it's the most affordable option, but I would not say that it is worth it. They overcharge for luggage, which often cancels out the money saved on fares. They are frequently considerably late with this instance being over two hours. Once my flight was cancelled and none of the passengers were notified until we were already at the gate. In that case, they were unable to get me out on a flight until over twenty-four hours later. I am currently sitting on a plane that was supposed to leave hours ago and there is some problem with the air, so the heat is running on an already very hot cabin. I understand that these things happen, but this is just one of many negative encounters. I would highly recommend against using their services."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Islip to Orlando,May 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Islip to Orlando. The customer is the last priority. Worst airline, rude staff, painful rapid descent.  We were scheduled to leave back home on 5/29, but arrived one minute late to check in time at the Orlando based Frontier ticketing kiosk. The woman at the ticketing desk, who informed us that we were too late to check our bag and would have to rebook another flight, was in no way willing to help us and delayed calling us until we were too late form the line. When she finally called us out of the line she said,""There was nothing she could do (or could have done, like calling us on the line one minute earlier)"" and waved us out of the line with a smirk on her face, as if she had disdain for us. The woman offered no explanation, apology or sympathy of any kind. It was if she enjoyed telling us as we went and lost our flight and incurred roughly another thousand dollars of flight costs. Spirit Airlines, who flew us home after Frontier dumped us on the curb, top to bottom wonderful flight, service, friendly and helpful staff. Perhaps Frontier Airlines should just replace ground crew with robots because I would be better able to understand why I was treated in such a cold hearted way. "
❌ Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Salt Lake City,May 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to Salt Lake City. This is the worst airline ever. On my departing flight, we were supposed to take off by 6:24pm. Everyone had just boarded and got settled in when the flight attendant came on the overhead speaker and told us that there was a situation and that we needed to grab our belongings and de-plane. Once everyone was off the plane, we found out that the pilot wasn’t even there. We had to wait 2 hours before we could get back on the plane to depart. I also wanted to stay in Salt Lake for one more day, so I got on the app to change my flight. It said that it would be $120 to do so. I hit the pay now and it came up as $222. It showed that it had been charged twice! So I freaked out not wanting to pay for a $222 ticket, so I tried to cancel it. Ended up having to call them to cancel it. That’s when they told me that I no longer had my first flight because “I had reserved that second flight, so there was nothing they could do.” In other words, they took away my flight that I had paid for and expected me to pay for the new ticket which I did not want. On top of that, they nickel and dime you for everything. "
❌ Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Providence,May 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,5,yes,7,"  Charlotte to Providence. My flight was delayed twice, a total of 3.5 hours, but it was $17. What do you expect when you pay that kind of price? Seriously. You’re not gonna get the most comfortable seats or the best service or free snacks. Big deal. If you want prime service, pay for it. Simple as that."

By far the worst airline I have flown. Cheapest quality seats, some kind of vinyl, plastic - hard, doesn't recline, awful posture and metal armrest. No inflight anything. Forget about entertainment, you don't even get water. They charge extra for every little thing. 17 hours layover. Horrible experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Tulsa,May 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  Denver to Tulsa. I’ve never been less impressed!! This was the first, and I promise the last time I ever fly this airline! I arrived at the airport just in time to find out my flight was delayed. At the time our delayed flight was scheduled to leave, I began to board with the first group. I stood on the ramp for 10 min without moving. Once I was seated, I overheard the flight attendant say this flight has been running late since yesterday!! How is that even possible? Once we finally arrived, 2 plus hours late, we had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes because there was a plane parked at our gate. What a joke!"

Our flight was canceled with no notification to us due to a payment not going through. It was confirmed to us that our only notification that our flight would be canceled was in small, light grey lettering at the very bottom of our email with the title confirmation saying “payment pending”. This was supposed to indicate that (although everything else looked like a normal confirmation with flight and seating information) our flight would be canceled with no further notification. They said “this happens all the time” - basically too bad so sad.  After a lot of pushback and over an hour on the phone, they gave us our original price of $50. Glad we found an employee willing to help but this airline has serious issues and obviously trying to rip people off."

I did not actually get on the plane because unknown to me this flight that I was confirmed to be on was cancelled without my knowledge. I had my trip to Vegas booked and paid for five months prior to this and I was looking forward to it. I get to the airport and found it weird there was no one around at the Frontier counter, so I started to ask why? Come to find out the flight I paid for was cancelled for whatever reason and I was supposed to be on the 5:55 pm flight. I had no idea because they never let me know. Needless to say my entire trip was ruined because of this airline! The next flight they had going to Vegas was two days later, that was pointless because i was due to come back the next day. They wouldn't even put me up in a hotel. I can promise I will never book a flight with this airline. "

Website said it was $30 for a checked bag. I went to the counter and had to pay $45 for a bag and then the lady tried to charge me another $45 for a carry on that I wasn't allowed to have. Also plane was delayed by over 1/2 hour. When we finally boarded and left we had to turn around within 45 minutes in the air. We had someone get sick and then the captain also said we had to turn around because they needed to fuel the plane. We were on the plane for over 4 hours total when it was only supposed to 1 hour 50 minutes. They should have offered complimentary drinks but they didn't. I was extremely disappointed in the airfare. Will not travel on Frontier Airlines again.

Then we were stuck sleeping in the airport. The next flight was 14 hours after the original flight should've left. The workers in the airport were rude and useless. I had to book a different flight with a different airline, which I should've just done in the first place. I guess this is what we do these days - give people the run around."

Customer service is awful. At the end of a flight they pitch a rewards program to you through a credit card. I had to call 5 times for someone to even help, they then said they are not knowledgeable on the rewards program before telling me I must be confused regarding their promotion and then they even withheld miles I earned with my early returns number. Just a horrible airline and I would fly into an airport farther away just to avoid them in the future."

Call customer service and all flights the following day are booked so my options are to cancel flight or sleep in DIA from 3:30AM Friday until mid morning saturday. I cancel flight and abandon trip, losing my hotel accommodations. The moment I cancel my phone notifies me the flight is now only 37 minutes delayed. I call back and wait another 20 minutesnon hold and pay to get back on the flight. This time they charge me $40 dollars more and give me worse seats. I get to the gate in boarding group 1 per my new ticket, and I’m not on the manifest list. I am then the last to board the plane as they figure out their software error. I fly to DIA with the carry on I’ve used for the last 300 flights no issue on any airline. At the connecting gate to SLC, rude gate agent tells me it’s too big (first time ever). I show him it fits in the stupid sizing tester. He still says I must check it. This airline just exists to bulk low income people. It isn’t even cheaper than others once you pay the baggage and other fees for things that just come with service on other airlines. Worst seats and service, worst website. Impossible to check in without 9000 confusing up-selling pop ups in your way. I will make this mistake only once. This airline is a joke."

And be very careful booking flights on Expedia or any other travel site. Customers are penalized for not booking directly thru Frontier. I had other airlines I could have chosen but I selected the Frontier flight because it was the “best” price. Turns out I had to pay substantially higher baggage fees because I booked with Expedia. So my great fare with Expedia will be around $100 more than the cost of the ticket. I have no choice since it is a non refundable ticket, so I’m screwed, thank goodness my return flight is with American Airlines, their baggage fees are much more reasonable and the same no matter where you book your flight. And good luck talking to anyone at Frontier, it took me almost an hour on the phone to get a human being and I’m very tech savvy. When I did get a human to speak with, all I got was an obviously scripted speech, waste of my time."

So I called customer service to file a claim and they said they did not know where our luggage was and that I would have to wait 4-6hrs before someone called. So we waited. Nobody called. So I called again, and they said the same thing that they could not track our luggage and did not know where it was. They said they would reimburse us for anything we buy since we had no clothes, nothing. Further, they said someone will keep me updated in 24hrs. The next day, still nothing. I call again and the same thing happens. It is day 3 here in ELP and we still don’t have our luggage. Don’t fly Frontier."

When I got to LAS, they couldn’t find my luggage because it was still in Chicago! I have been calling them all night to tell them where to deliver my luggage but couldn’t get through until 4 hours later after I find a claim. FA said everyone left for the day after they called.

The San Jose baggage attendant submitted a claim and assured me that the bag would arrive and be delivered by 2pm the following day. This was 10am. I was not offered any other information or advice on how to proceed with a reimbursement for temporary expenses. They did not know if my bag was still in Denver or flown elsewhere. I returned the following day after not hearing back and was told the bag had still not arrived and they had no way to track it as they are all manually loaded. I was given the direc baggage number for denver after being on hold for 45 minutes. The Denver attended “guessed” that my bag was flown to the wrong city, though there was no way of knowing where. Again, no remedy. I advised that I prefer the bag be shipped back to Denver as I would be leaving San Jose and could not intercept the bag. The following day, now three days after, I received a call at noon that my bag arrived in San Jose and they were delivering it to my friends address. The bag did not arrive. Nor did anyone answer the phone to provide an explanation. 100% will not fly Frontier again. Complete rip off to pay $40 each way for a checked bag that will never arrive. "

I had the worst experience of my travel life on Frontier Airlines. They changed the aircraft the day of the flight, and therefore had to find over 35 people that they could deplane. I got on, but the flight was delayed over 1 hour. Our pilot promised us 2 times that we would all make our connections in Denver, but no, we all ended up at customer service. The next flight to Seattle on Frontier was 24 hours later; I asked to be put on an Alaska flight that was leaving in 9 hours, but Frontier refused to accommodate my request. I bought a ticket on Alaska, and used a voucher from Frontier for a hotel room. Frontier employee told me to come to baggage claim early in the AM to retrieve my bag, but no, in the AM they could not locate it in Denver and told me to go to Seattle and file a claim. I tried to use the Frontier $10 meal voucher for a cup of coffee in Denver but it did not work. Got to Seattle and went to baggage claim and Frontier does not have a station at the baggage claim area; asked the Delta people where to go, and they literally laughed when they found out I had been on a Frontier flight, and said ""good luck!"" They told me to go to ticketing counter, but since there are no Frontier flights in the AM in Seattle, there was no one there. I went home and filed a lost bag claim online at 10:34 AM and got an e-mail that they would contact me within 6 hours; at 5:58pm I got a note that told me to call the Seattle ticket counter. Called Seattle, and they could find no record of my claim even though I had the confirmation number. Later that PM, they called back and said they found the bag, but they will not deliver it to me since I ""voluntarily"" separated from my bag in Denver. They can send it FedEx if I will pay. So can I go pick up the bag the next day after work? No, because they don't have any flights from about 4pm to 8pm, so no one will be there. I ended up driving to the airport 2 days later to retrieve my bag. I will not fly on Frontier again. "

I was not in a rush to get there and so I volunteered to take the later flight. Everything went smooth for my trip. However when I went to use my voucher 5 months later, it did not exist. I called the airline and talked to a representative who then said the voucher I received was only good for 3 months. I was nice and polite to the representative so he was kind and talked to a manager trying to help and fix the problem. The manager said Oh the voucher was only good for 3 months thats it, we can't do anything for you. So if they ask you to give up your seat for a voucher, don't trust them."

We were delayed a total of 5.5 hours after being notified on the half hour mark. No one could tell us why or give us any sort of reason. This includes the attendants at the gate and calling their customer service line. The man on the customer service line led us to believe we would receive a flight voucher of some kind a small we waited more than 3 hours. After waiting about 4.5 hours, a $15 meal voucher was given. Since we had already been waiting for a long time, obviously we had already eaten, and the voucher was meaningless to us. After calling the service line a second time, we were told there was nothing they can do. Maybe they save us some money on flights, but my time is worth more than a $15 meal voucher."

Although Frontier airlines offers cheap ticket prices, the service was beyond poor quality for the duration of my trip. All 5 of the self check in kiosks were broken and no one was helpful about directing the flow of travelers. The line to check baggage was long with only one person at the front desk but thankfully I was able to check in using their app. Our flight didn’t depart till 30 minutes after the scheduled departure time but after that everything went by pretty smooth. The seats were cloth over metal but that’s to be expected for a budget airline. For the a big international airport on a Friday morning, I think this airline needs a lot of improvement in their service department. Very disappointed."

You can book a flight for $99.00! However, here is my story on this airline:  They hit you for a seat assignment, a bag charge, a NyQuil sized drink and a small snack. Before you're finished, you have paid hundreds. Seats do not recline. The airline will delay, delay, and delay flights until they have a plane that has every single seat filled. If not, they cancel. If you enjoy getting to the airport early and spending all day there, then take this airline. "

This was booked via my credit card points but next time, I will use more points. Countless delays, for fuel, then the ramp closed due to lightning but lightning happened 30 minutes prior to the ramp opening again. Lack of updates from the crew doesn’t help. Oh and the ramp was closed due to lightning but they could fuel the plane, seriously! I also will add, there was a flight attendants that smelled something burning then proceeded to ask another attendant 8-9’ away. The attendant that asked ignored when I stated at least twice that I also smelled something. There will not be a next time for this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Philadelphia via Denver,March 2018,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3,yes,6,"  Ontario  to Philadelphia via Denver. Many people believe that flying Frontier is a bad idea. I do not quite agree with those people. During my trip, I flew both an A319 (oldest aircraft type in Frontier's fleet) and an almost brand new A320. On the first leg (ONT-DEN, a brand new route) I flew in Frontier's ""Stretch Seat"" product. It was pretty enjoyable, with great legroom, and a nice traytable. The second flight was in their regular seats. These were a bit less comfortable, but not too bad. They do not recline, and have a tiny tray table, not much bigger than an iPad mini. The Stretch seats are usually about 20 dollars more to reserve on your flight, and are a pretty good deal, however, the regular seats in the back are usually the cheapest, and they are still pretty comfortable if you want to give them a try. The flight from ONT-DEN was delayed for a few hours, and made for a very tight connection, Frontier claims there was snow in Denver, but when we landed, the ground looked very clear. The other flight was on time, and landed in PHL early. There was one big problem, the bags. My bags were checked, since it was cheaper than a carry-on. When the 2 bags were retrieved in ONT on the way there, one bag had clearly been broken into, with one zipper missing and the TSA lock gone. Frontier claims this is ""normal wear and tear"" and did not even apologize. On the way back, the other back was also clearly broken into, and another TSA lock was gone. No report was made, since they would just pull the same excuse. Frontier's staff are hit-or-miss. They will either be really friendly and glad to help, or very grumpy and offer no customer service. So would I fly them again? Yes, and no. While they were pretty cheap at about $950 for 2 people round trip and 3/4 flights booked for Stretch and with a checked bag, and about half the price of a comparable Southwest flight, they are no longer the cheapest option for me. jetBlue has just announced it will be flying JFK-ONT (yes, nonstop), and when I priced it out, it was half the price of my Frontier booking. Yeah. jetBlue is cheaper than Frontier to fly to Ontario. I think anyone would pick jetBlue, unless JFK is an issue, which it is not for me. So why would I fly them again? The answer is the miles. While I would not choose them to get to or from Ontario again, I would fly them on a shorter, nonstop flight. They have a pretty good mileage program, and a nice offer of 40,000 free bonus miles (they claim this is one round-trip international ticket or two domestic round-trip tickets) if you sign up for a credit card. So, overall, I would not be too scared to fly Frontier, as long as the price is right, and you are willing to give up a couple of things you might get on other airlines."

There are so many people who have moved to Charleston from NJ, NY and PA most flights you need to stop in Charlotte then onto another large airport. Going from Charleston (2 terminal airport) to Mercer Airport (1 terminal airport) is fantastic. I've been told this is only a temporary schedule I think you should consider having it all year. Charleston has great colleges and universities and it would make it much easier for families to commute. Plus Carnival Cruise leaves from Charleston with 4, 7 and 10 day cruises."

After almost 25 to 30 mins on hold, the service rep asked if I wanted to rebook. When I asked about the next flight to Miami, she says on Thursday - 2 days later!! I asked for my money back including a $40 baggage checked fee and a voucher for the inconvenience, the service rep said that the cancellation was due to bad weather conditions. The other airlines flights to the same destination were departing with no delays. Their staff showed no sense of urgency. I had to book a one way flight with American Airlines leaving 1hr 45 mins later. I will never flight with Frontier Airlines nor recommend them. They are unreliable and unreasonable."

I’ve never written a review but the experience with this airline is the worst experience of my life. They put us on a plane for 4 hours which is double than the duration of my flight then had everyone removed from the plane and back into the gate because it got cancelled due to rain. I couldn’t get a new flight until 2 days after, the lady at the gate told us we can pick up a hotel voucher and had us wait on a 2 hour line just to tell us there is no hotel voucher all they can do is issue a refund or give us a flight that’s 2 days away. They make you pay 50$ for each carry on that’s 10-15 pounds same price that a 50 pound checked luggage would cost, when we got to the flight that was 2 days after, after paying 400 to say In a hotel for 2 days they tell us our flights delayed 3 hours for no apparent reason when they should’ve texted us or we should’ve received some kind of notification. The workers nickel and dime you for anything and everything. You can’t even get a drink without them asking for your card. The seats are uncomfortable they do not move back, no entertainment, no outlet. You think you are saving money by buying tickets with Frontier but they’ll make you spend so much more with hidden fees. Just spend the extra 50$ to fly with delta or any other airline. "

And a 9.45 pm flight was delayed till 2.30 am and we were told at 12am that the flight is cancelled And that they would book us on a different flight and give accommodation too. We realised Frontier Airlines cancelled 4 flights yesterday around the same time. We got to speak to their official at 2am and got none that was promised. They could book us on a flight after three days (which was the day of my arrival) - somehow we managed a refund but I had to cancel everything - hotel, trip to antelope canyon just because Frontier Airlines chose not to fly! The reason for cancellation is still not told, refund is on the way, I have no proof that they cancelled the flight. So we were stranded, hungry, exhausted at Chicago airport at 2 am with nowhere to go. It’s been the worst experience so far as a tourist anywhere in the world. I have not come across any airlines that are so shameless."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Houston,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Denver to Houston. My flight was delayed 5 hours and counting. It will probably get delayed even more. And there is nothing that they are willing to do to fix it. When I asked about my flight the customer service just told me that it was delayed by 5 hours and tough luck. No apologies. No offers. No attempts to make it right. Terrible. Never fly with them.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,  We are flying home to Denver from San Diego. Our flight was supposed to leave at 11:30am. The now boarding sign was flashing for 30 minutes and there wasn’t a plane at the gate and the board status was “on time”. As I am writing this post it is 11:27am and we are still sitting in the terminal. My boyfriend spoke with the gate agent who wouldn’t admit there’s a delay and is unapologetic. I get it if there are delays - is it too late much to ask that we be told honestly when the plane is expected to depart.
✅ Trip Verified ,Airbus a 321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Cleveland,May 2018,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Tampa to Cleveland. I felt compelled to write this review of Frontier Airlines to show my support for a great company. There are many petty reviews out there complaining about trivial things and I wanted to reassure anyone on the fence about choosing Frontier to find some confidence in their decision. My family and I recently flew round trip for a vacation from Cleveland to Tampa. The entire process went very smoothly. Purchasing tickets and baggage fees was explained very well and easy to understand. I knew exactly what my fees were going to be before I purchased the tickets. The people at the checkin counter were helpful and polite. The people in Tampa were especially friendly. The stewardess were very nice and helpful. The seats on the airplane do not recline which I saw as a very good thing. No one can put their seat back on your legs and they were still comfortable. We also had very good pilots who did a great job getting us to our destinations safely. I would definitely recommend Frontier Airlines to anyone. If you want to get from point A to point B safely and without hassle, don’t hesitate to fly Frontier!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Saint Louis,May 2018,4.0,4.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,  Cancun to Saint Louis. Frontier Airlines cancelled our flight on Tuesday and made us sit around at the airport for 8 hours. They sent us to a resort for the night. We returned to the airport on Wednesday morning to realize our flight was delayed. We had to sit at the airport for 6.5 hours. Their communication was extremely inconsistent and organization was nonexistent. Spending 2 full days at an airport with no WiFi or means of communication was unexplainable. I’ve never been so frustrated and bored in my entire life. Frontier Airlines said they won’t refund any money just a discount on my next flight.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Cincinnati,May 2018,4.0,5.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Orlando to Cincinnati. Airports and airline staff differ from city to city. The Frontier staff members at Orlando International were exceptional. The previous flight arrived on time and our flight passengers were boarded efficiently and were waiting to push off. The flight was smooth and touched down to arrive at the gate ahead of schedule. The flight deck kept us informed of the necessary information. The cabin staff were excellent and very helpful. Frontier is a no frills airline transporting passengers to their destination as cheaply costwise and efficiently as possible. If I had wanted more of an airline I would have booked another airline. I can't speak about other flight crews, but I have to give the crew on this flight 5 stars. I will definitely fly with Frontier again. No major accidents in their history of transportation means something."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Detroit,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Austin to Detroit. This airline charges low flight rates but does not include bags or any other items to be carried onto or under the plane. They charge ridiculous fees for these services as add-ons. After booking with them and purchasing travelers insurance, the very next day I discovered that I will be on military orders and will not be able to fly on the days I had selected. So I filed a claim to try to reclaim my spent money. After almost a month of waiting, their claims department finally called me and told me that my policy does not cover military orders, and they charged me 99$ for canceling my flight, almost half the cost of the flight its self. The remainder of the money they did not reinberse me with, instead, they kept it on their website as a credit so I am stuck buying from this ripoff of a company or I lose my money."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Las Vegas,May 2018,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9, San Jose to Las Vegas. Would totally use this airline again. The flight crew was beyond friendly and even remembered my sons name on the return flight home 4 days later. Seats were assigned and extremely roomy for my 6’3” son and husband. We knew exactly how much the flight would be with baggage fees etc and found it to be very economical!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Trenton to Chicago,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Trenton to Chicago, we could not land so we returned back to Trenton due to mechanical problem . We were told that we were going to get help once we arrive back to trenton. When we got to Trenton there was not 1 person there to give us answers, all their gates were closed. Instead of fixing the issue and sending us back to our destination, most people had to spend the night at the airport. The ticket might be cheap but it so not worth it. Now i have to drive all the way to JFK to find a new ticket in the morning. Don't Fly Frontier, you will regret it for the rest of your life."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class, Dallas/Fort Worth to Denver,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Dallas to Denver. Do not fly Frontier through Dallas/Fort Worth, you get stuck outside security and can't even go to buy food. They have no warning or indicators. They were incredibly rude while I was getting my boarding pass, and wouldn't even help me get some help finding a wheel chair."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Orange County via Denver,April 2018,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Buffalo to Orange County via Denver. To start, my flight was delayed from Buffalo to my connecting flight in Denver, they never specified what reason the flight was delayed. I finally arrive into Denver, and when the time comes to board my flight to Orange County, I show up to the doors closing in front of my face, I ask nicely and respectfully to please just let men sprint to the plane. Then after being led to deal with customer service, I realized how unprofessional this company is. They were very rude and uncaring, they couldn't get me on another flight for about 11 hours, so while i'm standing in line, i'm letting people in line behind me go since I knew I was going to be there all day, and in that time after letting every person go passed me, the desk agent tells me that my only other flight had booked up in that time and never bothered to say anything. I asked to speak to a manager who said there was nothing that she could do. This all ended up costing me about an extra 800 dollars to get to my destination. I will never fly with this company again, not worth saving a hundred dollars to deal with such poor customer service. On the other hand, my flight attendants were incredible and very helpful with whatever was needed, just a shame that they work for such an unprofessional company from every other aspect. I definitely suggest to fly with any other airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Sioux Falls,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Miami to Sioux Falls. Will never fly Frontier again! We got to the Miami airport at 6:40am, their check in said they would open at 6:50. Two people finally showed up at 7:25 to start checking the 40 people that were now standing in line. Not to mention they charge $45 per bag! Absolutely ridiculous, luckily we didn’t have any carry ons or those would of been an additional $35. Customer service was poor. Very dissapointed with Frontier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Greensboro to Las Vegas via Denver,April 2018,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,yes,8, Greensboro to Las Vegas via Denver. After reading some rough reviews about Frontier Airlines I was alittle nervous about trying them out but the fares was so much cheaper that my wife and I decided to flew to Las Vegas with them. I was really surprised the crew was awesome really friendly and helpful all my flights were on time and early. I didn’t like paying extra so my wife and I could sit together that’s the only con to our flight every thing else was great. We normally use American to fly but now we will switch to Frontier as long as the fares stay cheaper. The food and drinks you have to pay for but they have some nice bundles that make things cheaper.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Trenton to Detroit,April 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Trenton to Detroit. Do not fly this airline. Was scheduled and confirmed for a 6 am flight and at 3:30 am, I receive an email stating they were sorry my travel did not go according to plan, and that they fell short this time. After calling customer service, I found out the flight was canceled due to crew availability - how do you cancel a flight less then 3 hours before takeoff? Obviously they had to know that they didn’t have enough people in the crew and failed to staff properly. It is severely poor management and communication on their part. I am very disappointed and extremely upset with how the situation was handled by frontier airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Minneapolis,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Denver to Minneapolis. Horrible. Never flying this airline again. There was a used napkin on my seat and dried blood on the seat next to me. They have hidden fees so you end up paying way more than you plan on paying. And to top it all off they lost my bag. So now I have to drive 5 hours to get home without my suitcase. This airline is a joke. Pay the extra couple bucks and fly Delta or anyone else.

Unfortunately I had to put 1 star to be able to write this review. The flight was delayed 5 times which I arrived 3:00 AM instead of 9:45pm. My baggage was delayed along with 15 other passengers for my whole 2 day flight, which in turn made my whole trip useless because everything I need for the trip was in the bag. When I tried contacting their so called customer service for a refund they were so rude, they didn't even apologize about the incident."

My 6am flight was delayed by 4.5 hrs for a mechanical malfunction. I missed my interview. Then, the return flight that evening was delayed for 2 hrs due to another mechanical malfunction. I never got any text/email announcement regarding the delays. I now know why Frontier is so cheap — it’s not worth it even for rock bottom prices."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Birmingham via Denver,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,  Las Vegas to Birmingham via Denver. This is the worse airline when it comes to missing your flight. I missed my flight due to military duty and they told me there’s nothing they can do about it. A customer service representative told me I couldn’t be comp for a flight back home I have to take my flight that I missed as a loss.  I never received any early check in emails or my flight is coming up also.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Charlotte,April 2018,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Providence to Charlotte. This was my first time using this airlines. And I've read hundreds of negative reviews, but you get exactly what you pay for. The flight attendants were nothing but wonderful. Very polite to me and my 4 year old daughter. The plane itself is on the bigger side, so if you get motion sick don't sit behind the wing in the middle. That's where we sat, and you could easily feel the drops in pressure there. We were fine, but if you do get motion sick it's not the spot for you . Overall good experience and I would recommend them to my family and friends"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Providence via Denver,April 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I'm writing this review in behalf of my son. He was flying from Salt Lake City to Providence via Denver. My son has Multiple Sclerosis. Which he has a hard time with his balance and he slurs when he is stressed. The airline took his carry-on when he boarded the plane in Salt Lake to Denver which had ll his medicine in it. When he tried to board in Denver, (he has tattoos and a man bun) they said he was intoxicated. The crew was afraid that he would become unruly since they assumed he was intoxicated they made him get off the plane. Mind you his MS meds were in the carry-on that they made him check at the gate. My son called me very upset. All Frontier Airlines told me all they could do was put him on the next flight to Providence which was Sunday night at 11:55pm which he was already been in Denver's airport since 10:30 Saturday night. They were no help at all."

My family waited for 3 hours until they cancelled the flight. Customer service was terrible and they did not even apologize for the inconvenience, no benefits were given, nothing. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to San Antonio,November 2017,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I were flying today from Raleigh Durham to San Antonio to attend our grand daughter's first birthday. There are only two flights per week out of Raleigh Durham, Fridays and Mondays, so Raleigh Durham isn't very important to Frontier. Our flight was delayed from 2pm to 5pm. After checking in at the airport, we were notified the flight had been delayed until 7:00. Thirty minutes later an update said the delay was 8pm, then 9pm. There was no other notification. When I went to the desk, I was informed the flight was cancelled. We could re-book for the next day, getting us in to SAT after our grand daughter's birthday party. We chose to take a refund, which will come in ""five to seven business days"". Funny, how Frontier Airlines takes my money immediately when booking, but it takes a week to get my money back."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Cincinnati,April 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  San Antonio to Cincinnati. I arrived 2 hours early and the plane got delayed 5 hours due to two separate malfunctions. They did not inform us on what the problem was the first time. When the first issue was resolved we boarded the plane and then another issue developed and we got off the plane and waited again. The second issue was apparently a “light” problem that took another hour to resolve. We were set to leave at 3:20pm and after many text updates stating the delays in 30 minute intervals we will apparently not leave until 8:40pm. I will never fly nor recommend Frontier ever again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Salt Lake City via Denver,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Pittsburgh to Salt Lake City via Denver. This was the worst travel experience I have ever been through. I booked my flight months in advance. I was supposed to have a one hour layover. One month before my flight, Frontier emails me saying they changed my flight. So I then I was supposed to leave four hours earlier and have a four hour layover. Okay. I planned my flight around work and wouldn’t have chosen that flight had I known it would be leaving that early. Couldn’t ever get a hold of customer service. Sat on hold multiple times for 40+ minutes listening to them tell me “lines are busy”. So then, day of flight, the flight got delayed three times just in that day. I sat in the Denver airport for eight hours. Terrible experience and terrible customer service. I will never fly with Frontier again."

My flights (Round Trip) were delayed by 3.5 hours from Oklahoma City to Las Vegas and from Las Vegas to Oklahoma City. The delay made me miss work time and a very important meeting. They do not care for the customer. The seats are terrible. Tiny and the cushion is so thin that your butt hurts! I will never travel again with Frontier Airlines nor recommend to anyone."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Raleigh,April 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Booked to fly New Orleans to Raleigh with Frontier Airlines. Worst travel experience of my life, they have no check in kiosks so they bottleneck serval flights through one line. I arrived over an hour early for my flight and by the time I got through the line it was past my boarding cutoff. The rep did not care one bit I was stranded and told me straight face that the next available flight was not until Friday (it is Monday) and did not have a single suggestion on how I might arrive somewhere in my home state. I even looked up an alternate flight through their airline online for that night and he said he could not book it because it was connecting with another airline!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York,April 2018,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," First of all, I should have checked the reviews of Frontier Airlines first before using it. Flew Miami to New York. So far, the worst ever experience in an airline. I have never felt so insulted, ignored and badly treated. The airline staff at the gate are so rude and lazy. When you asked questions, they do not care to answer or they do not know. My flight was delayed when I traveled to NY and then delayed by 3 hours when heading back to Miami. I emailed the airline for compensation and they told me they couldn't do anything. The delay made me miss work time and a very important meeting. They do not care for the customer. I was about to apply for their credit card. The seats are terrible. Tiny and the cushion is so thin that your butt hurts! I will never travel again with Frontier nor recommend to anyone."

Multiple issues with this carrier. First time flown, and the last time. Adding carry on during online check in is $40 instead of advertised $25. This wastes all the savings. Airplanes are bare bone. No TV, Wifi, Chargers, etc. The flight was over 1hr delayed. It was still a lucky situation unlike other flights e.g. to St Louis was delayed for 6 hrs. In-flight staff turn their heads and no greetings whatsoever. They're also the ones who do the cleaning. You can guess the quality of it."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Denver,April 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Minneapolis to Denver. Never even got on the plane. As I write this the plane still hasn't taken off. Had a flight for early in the morning and the plane had sat overnight at the gate. When it can time to board the plane everyone lined up like normal and right before we are to start boarding we are all told their was a small issue and would be a few minutes. After 1 hour they finally came on and said that some lines on the plane had froze and were trying to warm them up. From that point the flight just got quietly delayed hour by hour never announce but only if asked at the ticket counter. Did nothing for the travelers. I was forced to buy another plane ticket to fly to my destination. Never again will I chose this cut rate airline.

My friends got on the plane first because they had child, said people were already in my seat. The plane is still sitting there another 45 mins after I got off the phone. I'm diabetic, my meter & medication we're in my luggage, lady at the gate, oh well it will be there when you get there. After they heartlessly resold my seat, they tell me I need to pay another $99 to take the next flight in 2 days. After going back and forth ,they said they will wave it this one time. For 2 days I have no meter, no medication, luggage and no where to go. I had to purchase 2 more days at at hotel, more clothes, toiletries and a bag at my expense. 2 days later we're waiting for our flight and yet again the plane is double booked by 7 and 7 people have tickets without seat numbers listed as NN. No compassion, no conscience about disrupting people lives. And I was never offered any compensation. They forged my arrival time, but I'm sure it documented with corporate, the time they were on the phone with me. They can't run there business like this, charging fee for double booking. There were other passengers on other flights, stuck saying the same thing. Where to we go for help?"

The airline announced no assistance or updates for the delay. There were three elderly people sitting in wheelchairs for at least an hour and a half before a few of us got up and talked to them and asked if they could use any assistance. Airline personnel have done nothing apart from to tell us that we were eligible for food vouchers, the airline never announced it over the public loudspeaker. I’ve never seen an airline treat passengers with such disregard and disrespect. I have flown all over the world. I spent 21 years of my life serving this country in the Army. The customer service from The Air Force flight crews exceeded anything Frontier has to offer. My wife and I tried this airline just once, this will be our last time."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Orlando ,March 2018,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Providence to Orlando. The only thing that I was not happy with was the fact that I had to pay $45.00 for a carry on both ways. I never read that on the website or in any of the emails that were sent to me prior to departure. There were 4 people in my party so that was $360.00 and the flight was $210 each ticket. That was a rip off. I will never be flying with Frontier again. Just shameful.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to New York La Guardia,April 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Atlanta to New York La Guardia. Very disappointed in Frontier’s website functionality and customer service. I checked in by Frontier’s website and it displayed my boarding pass. There was no option to print it or have it emailed to me. I took a screenshot of my brother’s ticket to send to him, however, once I got to the security gate the boarding pass was no longer available on my phone.I put my confirmation into the website several times and while it confirmed that I signed in and would resend the itinerary, my boarding pass was not available. Due to this I had to return to the front of the airport to print my boarding pass as a result I missed my flight. I had to go back and forth with a frontier customer service representative to even get a refund on my flight and even when I got that they still charged me a $100 fee. This is disappointing seeing as the reason I missed my flight was on Frontier’s account. Please disregard the cabin space and cabin staff review. I had to select something for my review to go through"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,March 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Orlando to Las Vegas. I recently used Frontier Airlines for the first time and the experience was not memorable. Prior to the departing and arriving flights, there was no proper clean up of the aircraft meaning there was visible trash everywhere like excessive amounts of food and trash on seats and floor. The workers prior to boarding improperly handled baggage, throwing them on the track and leaving them either damaged or dirty. Also, the prices this airline charges for the full flight and checked bag then extra for each carry on bag and extra for seating of choice is not acceptable when the experience and treatment of customer is not equivalent to ""high value"".

The price would have been cheaper had I paid online but I saw no notice of this prior. Same goes for choosing a seat, they want to charge you $10 to $19 dollars to select a seat? What a terrible experience and I haven't even gotten on the plane yet. The ""customer service"" is a joke and was absolutely no help. And beware if you do call for help they charge more over the phone, so expect to pay an additional charge. I will never fly Frontier again. Hidden fees and hassle."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Francisco,January 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,5,yes,9," Las Vegas to San Francisco. As a Norwegian person that works in the service business myself that loves to travel the world I have seen a lot of airports, airlines and staff members! Upon finding this site and seeing all the hate for this low budget airline getting so many negative reviews that I felt I should add my experience this birthday trip in January for 2 weeks! Traveling from Stavanger (Home) to Miami - Orlando - Las Vegas and San Francisco! And 2 of 3 domestic flights was with Frontier Airlines and I was pleasantly surprised by experience despite what I have heard from people I met on my travels that Frontier provide poor service, bad and should be avoided at all cost! I had the completely opposite experience with the airline! The staff at the check in counter was super friendly and helpful and made me feel heard and seen! Cabin staff was also friendly and helpful! Only thing i found ""strange"" was the sales pitch about their bonus reward system they had during the flight as that is not something I have seen before. For the aircrafts themselves I must say to be low priced that the comfort was good for cheap flights! Much better then older Norwegian domestic flights! Soft seat made by cheap material but for short haul it's more then fine and enough leg space and I have long legs so that was super nice to have. There was a major delay on my flight from Orlando to Las Vegas and it made me nervous for missing the Cher concert I was going to that night but they hustled really hard to make up the delay and actually managed to shorten the delay by several hours so I was impressed even though I was annoyed and slightly stressed at the time! So all in all, I would fly again with Frontier when I am in the States and going to travel with domestic flights!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Little Rock to Denver,March 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1," Our plane had mechanical issues and we were stuck in airport for five hours, causing us to get to Denver around 1am. No food establishments were open at Little Rock airport after 8pm. Frontier gave us food vouchers for our delay but we couldn’t use them. When we finally got on the plane and they were serving snacks we couldn’t use our food vouchers. Because we got to Denver 1am, car rental places were closed and we were forced to stay in a hotel in Denver. Our plan was to drive 1.5 hours and stay were we had reservations. Frontier refused to reimburse for hotel. They have us a voucher to redeem for a future flight. Have to use within 90 days - we are not planning to travel during that time frame. Not satisfied! The staff at the airport and on the plane were friendly and respectful - however their hands were tied. I called customer service the next day and didn’t get anywhere there either."

Haven’t even taken off yet, about 40 minutes after departure time. Told they were resetting a computer, well 40 minutes goes by, absolutely no update, nothing. Finally, “took a little longer to reset, but were just waiting for it to finish up, we will try our best to get you there at your arrival time.” Remind me never to fly Frontier Airlines again. Awful customer service and poor employees. Writing this while on the plane, that still has not taken off."

The Frontier staff are a joke with zero ability to communicate effectively. Every answer is an attempt to avoid giving a direct answer. They have zero empathy or compassion for customers as well. This is a dirt cheap airline with dirt cheap service. You get what you pay for.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Salt Lake City,March 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to Salt Lake City. Worst flight experience. I have never booked Frontier before and used a site that searches multiple airlines. To save 10.00 on my fare, I chose Frontier over Delta. That savings cost me an additional 40.00 for my carry on!!! Then a 3 hour delay for mechanical problems. I could have practically driven home in the same time. Pay extra for a bag. No drinks in spite of sitting on board for 3 hours, or we could disembark and buy our own!  I asked for accommodations for a deaf passenger, nothing. Why does this airline even have the option of selecting a disability if they do nothing? How does a deaf passenger know what kind of delays are taking place when there is zero communication? My ticket said special accommodation : DEAF. They didn't even acknowledge my disability. I really should report them for violating the Americans with Disability Act."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Orlando,March 2018,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Las Vegas to Orlando. I went into this flight knowing it is bare bones: no free refreshments, uncomfortable seats, etc. And that's fine, you get what you pay for. My advice to pay the slight premium for a reputable airline, comes from their terrible customer service once problems do arise. My checked luggage was returned to me with the zipper mutilated (now it will not unzip) and the fabric ripped. Understandable, things happen in transportation and the expectation is that they will take responsibility for it and rectify the situation. Instead I have had a three week back and forth argument with customer service telling me that Frontier is not liable for normal wear and tear to baggage and I should have read the Contract of Carriage before flying with them, and me asking how my bag being mangled is normal wear and tear. If you request to be put in contact with a supervisor, they will ignore your request and continue to tell you that this is their resolution and they hope you will fly with them again. I even paid for the insurance and came to find out that it only covers lost luggage, not damage to luggage. So whatever problem arises (and there will be problems), Frontier will do everything in their power to avoid responsibility."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Islip to Miami,February 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10," This is my first experience on a low cost airline flying from Islip to Miami. Frontier Airlines is like a Pre-paid Cell Phone Carrier. You only pay for the services you need as you go. ""Pre-paid Services with Low Fares Done Right"". I never knew you can purchase a round trip to Florida under a $100 dollars and then if you book your checked baggage online at the time of booking it was only $25 dollars per bag. You get the best rates at the time of booking. We had the best flight experience during our trip. Staff were professional, you pay for what you want (snacks and drinks), and the flight experience was great. The only improvement I would recommend is to install an inflight information screen with a choice for Pre-Paid Entertainment and to offer Sandwiches on the airline. If they have these services, it would have been the best experience. You just have to bring your own device for that for now if needed especially when you have kids. I would definitely recommend this airline to everyone. Our family enjoyed our trip. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,New York to Atlanta,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  New York to Atlanta. Ticket Agent customer Service was rude and don't care attitude. It was almost impossible getting through the airport itself which took me 45 mins just to get to the terminal where the ticket booth is located. Then when I tried to check my bags 1hr before the flight and they refused to check my bags. Then the agent argued with me for almost 30mins so I missed the flight all together and had to be rebooked on a flight the next day because they only have 1 flight per day. There is an escalator going up to the ticketing station but no escalator going down also the elevator is broken. None of the baggage handlers tried to assist with helping me with my bags back downstairs. I'm currently 5 1/2 months pregnant. When I tried I strained my stomach so i just broke down into tears. Underpriced tickets to be overcharged for bags. $45 per checked bag and $45 per carry on luggage. I fly for work frequently and will never fly this airline again. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Trenton to Ft Myers,March 2018,1.0,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Trenton to Ft Myers. My wife and 9 year old son arrived 2 hours prior to our flight, as required, but no one was there from the airline to check us in. It took 40 minutes for the front desk folks to arrive, and begin check-in. In the mean time, 200+ people on two separate flights are waiting in a line that wasn't moving. To add to the experience, the people in line enjoyed the 20 degree winter weather every time the front door of the main entrance way opened. When we arrived, we found out through other passengers (and not the airline) that the airport had only one push-back tug, and that it was broken. A second flight, heading to Tampa, had passengers there 3 hours before us. Ultimately both flights were cancelled. That means in 8-10 hours a problem couldn't be solved, leaving 300+ passengers to fend for themselves. Four times we received e-mails from the airline indicating that the flight was delayed, and that it would be taking off in an hour or so later. Based on what? Appeasement with no grounds in fact. What airport has only 1 pushback tug? Actually zero! What airline nev =er told us why the flight was cancelled? What airline/airport doesn't have a ""Plan B?"" The airline rescheduled us arbitrarily, on flights from other airports, with no consideration of where passengers lived. They also didn't give us round trip transportation. We, for instance, were arbitrarily re-booked on a flight on a different airline leaving Philly, but they wouldn't re-book our return flight back to Philly. They wanted us to fly Frontier on the return trip. Talk about lip service customer support--who would leave their car in Philly, and then fly back to Trenton--where you have no car for transport home? What airline has you wait 5 hours, sends you through security, and then cancels your flight 10 minutes after everyone makes it through security? That's what happened, folks! When we asked who was in charge of the operation, we were told ""I think a guy named Chris is in charge. Well where is he at so we can voice our concerns? ""We don't know"" we were told. Our Frontier/Trenton Mercer airport experience ends with the passengers heading outside to get their checked luggage that was taken off the plane in a building 300 yards away. Did they check our luggage tags as we departed - not at all. Could they have brought our luggage a bit closer in 20 degree weather. Sure, but wouldn't that be true customer service? Actually, the night ended with a 1 1/2 hour wait in line to re-book a flight, which they wouldn't re-book. ""We can't do anything, corporate calls all the shots from Denver,"" we were told. If you get enough people angry, Frontier Airlines, the only people ""on the frontier"" will be the corporate suits that have forgotten how to treat their customers! 300+ people had a terrible experience last evening, and I'm sure will voice their disgust to others!"

Upon arrival to the check in desk I was told that I needed to pay 45.00 dollars for each carry on or checked luggage, I ended up paying 90.00 for 2 carry on(mine and my friend's). The lady at the desk had that whatever attitude who does not care if you travel or not and tries to make you feel that she is doing a favor to you checking you while it should be the opposite. I would rate this lade zero. I do not have any bad or good review for the staff at the gate desk, I did not have any interaction longer than 1 minute with them, they were constantly announcing that carry on and check luggage would cost 60.00 dollars now if they were not paid prior at the check in desk. The plane now. All the seats were sold and as a consequence there were not enough overhead compartments for all carry on luggage(which is understandable), but the neither the gate desk staff nor flight attendants informed that issue and failed to propose checking the rest of the carry on, instead they were desperately removing luggage from one compartment to another to make room and secure them all five minutes before taking off. The plane floor was never vacuumed nor the back seat magazines' compartments( not sure if that the right name for it). In my magazine compartment and my friend's I found gum and candy wraps, I cannot really tell if it was the same case for all passengers. My friends suffers of motion disease and was looking for an emergency bag in case of vomiting but no bags were placed in any compartment. I asked the flight attendant to get me one (she was busy accommodating the carry on, but she answered that she will help me soon). Instead getting a real emergency bag I got a grey shopping bag and when I say"" thank you"", she replied ""de nada"" what means you're welcome in Spanish. Perhaps my Cuban look or my Miami accent made her think I needed a reply in Spanish to understand. I found it very disrespectful. In customer service you never switch languages unless the client does it first, plus the right answer was not de nada or you're welcome, it's my pleasure. The flight per se was very smooth. I would like to congratulate the captain. My overall experience with Frontier was bad. "

I'm 5'8"" tall and could barely sit comfortably in the incredibly close seats. Seats are not at all comfortable. I never flew an airline that practically charges for the air you breathe. I can't believe $45 for a carry on! My flight was supposed to leave at 9:50am and land at 12:28pm. We boarded the plane and then had to deplane and wait for another plane to take its place. Obviously a mechanical issue although gate agents denied it. Finally left close to 2 hrs late. Totally frustrating day. Never again!"

Frontier managed to lose my baggage on a direct flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas. My baggage was however located in San Antonio, Tx more than 24 hours later. In addition to that, I’m being told that they are unable to get my luggage to me for another 48 hours. Terrible, horrible service. I was offered a chance for a free flight but why on earth would I deliberately put myself through such a horrible experience for a second time. This was my first and last time flying with Frontier and they should be ashamed."

Wednesday, February 28 7.00am. However, tonight’s return flight from Miami to Milwaukee: flight attendants poor. Not prepared for boarding, not welcoming - it was an evening flight and they left the overhead light on high for the full flight, poor lady placed coat over head to sleep and the crew were so loud dropping items, talking socially. Male attendant took out a book and sat almost immediately. The crew made faces when passengers spoke to them. Passengers asked about snacks and told they did not have any, however front staff were eating. Final straw was when they took out garbage bags and were making balloons with them and popping them. This was just the most obnoxious, unprofessional crew I have seen when traveling. On a final note when we landed one of the female flight attendants were so disorganized she could not even tell us the correct time. While waiting for luggage other passengers expressed they would be writing, calling and blogging over the experience. "

If we are lucky enough to actually get on the plane tomorrow it will be 48 hours since we were supposed to take off. I am a young woman traveling by myself with a three-year-old and was offered zero help with finding a room, food, or transportation. I have already had to pay almost $600 out-of-pocket to stay these extra two days. I do have travel insurance on these flights and after talking to the girl at the ticket desk her manager and the customer service phone number that they gave us all I received was rude attitude and no help.

The agent would not offer me a refund and I had to be transferred to a supervisor just to obtain a credit. I was told that I’d have 6 months to use the credit. I used half of the credit in January and I called back in March to use the rest of the credit. A supervisor told me that it expired and that I was told I would have to use it in 90 days and it was also on my credit email. I could hardly understand the supervisor, so I asked for an American agent because of the bad reception, feedback, and language barriers. She informed me that Frontier has no American agents. After having to ask to speak to her superiors three times, she finally transferred me to an agent who also told me that despite me being told I’d have 60 days to use the credit, the policy is 90 days. I told him that $35 of it was a bag fee and it makes no sense that I have to forfeit a bag fee. He told me he will not reinstate any of the credit for me. I am appalled because I spend so much money with Frontier Airlines and even use their credit card that the airline would be so stingy over $67. Nonetheless I will now make formal complaints every time I am dissatisfied with my service. Frontier is the only airline that refuses to offer refunds for purchases made within 24 hours. I’ve made reservations on all airlines and was able to cancel them despite the dates of departure restrictions."

At 1:40pm, Frontier Airlines cancelled our flight. No notification, I found out via checking the flight status on my phone. The gate sign simply switched over to Memphis. We went to talk with the Frontier customer service agent. We were about 100 people deep in the line and so an agent from a different gate said he could help us. He said the earliest flight back was Monday evening. I told the agent Monday would not work as I cannot miss work. He didn’t care. No vouchers. No negotiating. No sympathy. They wouldn’t put us on another Frontier flight, connecting or direct. I asked for a connecting flight to Chicago, Omaha, Nashville, Memphis, anywhere. Nothing. Many people around us were completely distraught. Four flights at the very same time left Denver and landed safely in Minneapolis. The airlines were Delta, American, Southwest, and Sun Country. Why would Frontier cancel our flight when everyone else was leaving? Finally, I asked for a refund and rented a car. Yes, I drove from Denver, Colorado, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, all through the night and made it home 15 hours later. Think twice before flying Frontier. Our experience was that they do not have any customer service standards and they have little care for their customers’ happiness. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable. They’ve become a budget airline."

I was told to get in the need help line. I spoke to an agent who did not care that I had a boarding pass and 3 children under 6. Everyone absolutely refused to take my bag or allow me to board my flight with my family. My husband ended up flying home with the children and I was told that I should wait 24 hours to catch the next flight. There was no option to board the plane and have my bag follow.

Nothing was done in a timely or efficient manner. Food voucher were finally passed out but then the flight time was moved up so we were afraid to leave the area, then the flight was delayed again. The hotel they took us to had a buffet we had voucher for but it closed with 20 minutes of us getting there and we weren't told this would happen. The lack of information passed to the passengers , the rudeness, and the total lack of concern shown by the staff just astounds me. The airport had no wifi and there was no way to contact anyone at home to let them know what was going on. There was another Frontier flight that was delayed the same day and those passengers were treated even worst At least we were not put on the plane for 3 hours and not allowed to eat, drink or use the bathroom like they were. I wI'll never fly with frontier again. They cost me over 350 dollars and 24 hours of my life and want to give me a coupon for 200 dollars to make it right. The coupon is good for 3 months, but I can't afford to take a vacation again that soon and even if I could, I would not fly with them."

I was told to go to the frontier desk to have them print a paper one for me. There were no frontier employees around that could help me. I spent 30 minutes trying to find a frontier employee to help me. Missed my flight. Finally found a frontier employee to help me out and when I told them what was happening their response was “well, we were here, but we were in our back office.” After talking to the frontier employees they were having trouble even switching me to another flight for the next day. Two of them stepped away and I could here them going “what do we do?” “They we’re supposed to have that issue with the electronic passes fixed.” Anyways they were of no help other than wishing me luck and trying to help me find a flight on another airline. Not only am I losing a day off of my planned trip, I had to book a $600 flight with another airline to get me out of here. Plus an extra night of hotel expenses in a city I’m not supposed to be in."

When I attempted to check in, my carry on bag was charged at an additional $76 additional for the round trip, increasing my transportation costs by over 30%. At this late date, I have no other option but to pay the ransom and complete my trip. I have no doubt that this was the original intent. An honest company would not do this. I won't be flying Frontier again and will inform my friends and family of this practice. It's not quite bait-and-switch, but it's close."

For sure a airline that nneds to be re-evaluated, not from anyone else but from the people who buy the tickets.

A lot of miscommunication and rude employees. On our way back to Orlando we landed in Palm Beach instead of Orlando because it was foggy according to the pilot! Then the pilot suggested to leave our belongings on the plane as we will fly soon and to leave the plane to rest. Surprise, after 2 hrs of waiting they announced that the flight would be delayed an 8 extra hrs (it was 8am and said we would fly at 3pm). Didn't buy it as they didnt seem to be sure of anything. Airplane crew left the passengers after 1hr of landing (because they punched out), the person in charge at the desk was yelling at people but thank you Frontier for the 10$ voucher meal, not even enough to feed one person. To deal with the refund they tell you good luck with their customer service. People had missed their cruise, rented vehicles (extra expenses) just to get out of the way of this horrible airline. "

The girl announcing barely spoke English and nobody could understand her. The on-board staff rudely rushed everyone to “expedite” boarding. Not our fault they were late. The one stewardess couldn’t smile at anyone and yelled at people. There were increased parking fees in Pittsburgh due to the late flight. Then they announced “free miles” for everyone.

Wow, thanks! I guess I'm going to need it considering I will be waiting 3 additional hours, my non-stop now has a 2 hour layover and I will be arriving to my destination 5 hours later via another airline. The reason I booked with them is because they messed up my first flight ever with them and they sent me a voucher, a voucher has now turned into a nightmare. I call customer service and am on hold for 45 minutes (due to high volume, I wonder why) get through and get put on hold again. Get to the supervisor who offers me a flight which is leaving from a city 4 hours away, and arriving even later which is supposed to be a better option? God forbid I took it, I'd arrive in Houston from Austin and they will have cancelled that one too. I am all for being cramped, limited baggage, even subpar service onboard -  you get what you pay for but I can't even get that!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,February 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to San Francisco. Absolute worst airline ever. First of all, don't let the cheaper fares fool you! You have to pay 45$ to check a bag and $30 for a carry on and $12 to select a seat. At this rate I should have gone with Southwest and gotten some decent service! The flight was scheduled as on time yet we took off 45 minutes after schedule with NO explanation why. The service inflight is terrible. The flight attendants spend most of the time talking over the intercom about a frontier credit card which is annoying and distracting for people trying to work/sleep! After landing we sat on the plane while at the gate for another 30 minutes. The flight was incredibly bumpy and uncomfortable! Where the heck did the tray tables go! Online check in via phone is also nearly impossible. I got off my flight so agitated. I will never fly Frontier ever again! Oh yea, and a cup of ice is $2.99."

I spent $350 on a flight and they can't spare a soda or juice for customers. Cannot check in early as they don't have agents available until 2 hrs prior to departure. The agents are then recycled to boarding. Baggage claim was super slow. No cabin wifi, no in flight entertainment. No plugs. Never again."

Only reason I am taking the time to write this is because I now have to wait 5 unwanted hours in the airport due to flight delays. This happened to me when I flew Frontier in May. Delays both flying to and from Mexico. This weekend (Feb 2018) we went to Palm Springs for a wedding (only there for two nights) I’ve spent the whole day Friday in the airport due to 5 hour flight delay. Now Sunday coming home guess what, a 5 hour delay! Woo! Except this time we can’t even check our bags in so we can’t grab a drink or food or anything just get to sit here. Oh guess what they offer...a $50 voucher for another frontier flight.  So worth it to spend more money for any other airline just to avoid the delays (not even weather related). All to sit and wait to sit on an extremely uncomfortable terrible flight experience. Going to be so fun landing at 1am and be at work at 6am. f you fly Frontier just plan on showing up late to the airport."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to San Juan via Orlando,February 2018,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  I purchased a trip from Omaha to San Juan via Orlando on December 2017 from Frontier Airline. I received a call from Travel One notifying me that Frontier cancel and the only option was to provide a refund. The only justification provided by the Frontier was that they decided not to flight to San Juan during July 2018 gave me no other option. I am not satisfied with their excuse. I purchased this e-tickets ahead of time to get the best deal and now I had to buy this portion of the trip and pay a lot more due to this cancelation. This is not acceptable, specially we made plans ahead to time. This is a non-reliable airline and will never use their services again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to San Francisco via Denver ,February 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1," Never again! I do not recommend Frontier Airlines under any circumstance. We first flew from San Francisco to Washington DC and the flight was very bumpy and shaky. The real problem, though, was when my flight from DC to Denver (to fly back to SF) was cancelled out of the blue on the day of departure. This left me with no other option than buying extremely expensive last minute tickets from another airline (of course!) for the next morning very early. The fact that Frontier cancelled my flight has endangered my other flight to Europe the next day which is from San Francisco. The only other flight they had to offer me was on February 13th (3 days after my scheduled flight that was cancelled). I was reimbursed the flight value and received a voucher to fly with them another time. They are not reliable, the flight is not pleasant. Please consider all of these when you wish to fly with Frontier."

First they charge you $38 for a carry on, then they charge you $13 extra per seat if you want to sit with your husband or wife, if you have a connecting flight it is an additional $6. The seats are akin to a park bench. They do not recline, they do not have any padding, basically a park bench. If you want padding and a seat that reclines it is $60 extra seat. Then if you want your watered down ginger ale and bag of almonds? $2.99! Oh and no cash accepted! There was a woman on our flight who vomited 10 mins prior to landing, she flipped on her call light. The flight attendants ignored her. They simply said over the PA system ""If this is not a medical emergency turn off your call light"". Who does that? The woman finally had to get up and go into the aisle and ask for paper towels. This airline is ridiculous! Their mobile app is miserable. Their registration process is miserable. Their flights are miserable!. Stay away!"

First time flying this airline and never again will I use them. My flight arrived over 5 hours late and then when I go to get my luggage it is not there. I then go to the counter and no one is working so I had to wait another 90 min to find an employee to help me. Long story short it’s three days later and I still don’t have my bag or any of my clothes and they said I still won’t be getting it for another 5 days minimum. Awful all around. No in flight entertainment and when I ordered a (overpriced) beer on board I was told they didn’t even have any left. So frustrating and stressful trip all around with this airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to New Orleans ,February 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I've never flown Frontier or any discount airline before, and decided to give it the benefit of the doubt when I bought roundtrip nonstop tickets from Philadelphia to New Orleans, knowing that there was a $45 fee for carry-on, and that any frills typically complimentary on regular airlines would cost extra. I was completely aware of that, however, the morning of my flight at 12.30am, I received an email subject line ""Travel Alert!"" stating that my flight was cancelled. For no reason. Upon calling customer service, they told me that it was weather related, however, like a human being with an ounce of a brain I checked New Orleans' airport conditions and there was no advisory whatsoever and 100% operational. Clearly, they cancelled the flight because it was underbooked and it would not be profitable to fly. Frontier is a group of lying cost minimizers to cheap people out on a daily basis, and for paying customers this is unacceptable. Additionally, their scam of an insurance provider was absolutely zero help, a waste of $10.95. Never buy travel insurance from Frontier if you're ever unfortunate enough to have to fly with them. My first and last time spending money on this ""airline"". Leaves a horrible taste in my mouth and gives a bad name to Denver."

Then when i told them i could not possibly do that, they refused to give me a refund. So i basically just flew fron San Juan to Philadelphia sit here all day (literally like 15 hrs) and go back to San Juan all on my dollars. Thanks fot showing me what bad customers service is. "

Finally boarded to find rock-hard seats that don’t recline & are packed as tight as FAA will allow. Landed & received e-mail with ‘apology’ & a $150 voucher.

All flights canceled today, so I'm stuck in Buffalo NY at the mercy of other airlines. My husband and I have two kids we have got to get back to in Miami. We are coming back from our anniversary and Frontier was just the icing on the cake. The audacity to tell me that the extra money I used to pay for good seats is going towards the payment of the new itinerary. So do I get special seats in the next airline since I paid for it? Nope! How can they not maintain their planes and make sure that all is well. "

I got to the gate 9 minutes before take off time with 2 small children and they wouldn’t let me on. He had me go sit down until he was finished with what he was doing. Then he forgot about me. When I went back up he told me he couldn’t get me on a flight until 2 days later. Another representative told me that she documented that I was late due to security and they should give me a refund if I call. I called and they told me that I was just marked as no show. I asked about another flight which I had already looked up online and she quoted me a price that was 3 times the online price and was going to charge me $10 on top of that for booking on the phone. They were unwilling to even allow me to use the funds from the three tickets for one flight. Then when I finally got to California via Southwest (wonderful airline), I went to find my suitcase which had been on the flight they wouldn’t let me on. Well, there was no one at the airport for Frontier so I had to wait 4 hours until someone was back at work! I will never use them again."

Frontier Airlines was a good airline years ago but now it is an ultra low cost scamming airline. I did not do my homework when I bought low priced airline tickets and got shocked when we had to pay $120 for one checking baggage and 2 carryons. That was no economy airline. My husband and I are members of the frequent flyer group and my husband has the Frontier Airlines credit card. The only benefits are being able to get frequent flyer miles which we will probably not wish to use. We flew on United and got a low cost but we got benefits as frequent flyers with United and since we have United credit cards. We will fly United more. Unless there is no other airline going to a desired location, we will refuse to fly on Frontier Airlines."

Decent prices, but that’s the only plus. I paid $45 for a first class seat for an over night flight. The seat was the harder than economy on Allegiant, the seat would not recline a centemeter and they required me to place my purse in a bin because of the wall infront of the first row of first class. The flight attendants were not friendly, the aircraft was nothing special. If you are expecting not a single frill or element of luxury then fly frontier"

First of all, I had no idea they charge $45 just for a carry on! The reason I use a carry on is to avoid the fees of checking a bag, since it was the same price either way I decided to just check it. Then I discovered the flight was delayed by an hour, I wasn't told why or given any heads up so I could plan accordingly before I got to the airport. Now I'm standing here in LAX waiting and they just announced that since it's a full flight they are allowing passengers to check their bags free of charge. That would've been nice to know had I not already paid the fee, very annoyed and displeased."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Philadelphia to Orlando,February 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," All the reviews are dead on. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6.00, we were informed via email 18 minutes prior to check in the flight would be delayed 6 hours and 45 minutes. After calling and speaking to a Frontier Representative (who was very difficult to understand) she said they were just made aware of the delay! The delays had been going on from the day (yesterday) before. It's obvious they are diverting flights for the super bowl to reep the monetary benefits and leaving others customers hanging. Our family of 6 was going to Disney & had prepaid for park passes ($500+/day) for everyday. We are losing 90% of the day. That was the whole reason we booked such an early flight. They were not willing to do anything but refund our tickets, we are still out $500 for the first day of park passes. Had they informed us an hour earlier we could have switched flights and flown out of Trenton, NJ and had the same departure and arrival. We didn't save any money it actually cost us $500 extra by flying Frontier. They were willing to do absolutely nothing other than refunding our flight. They will not offer reduced ticket prices or future tickets (not that I would use them at this point). They are completely complacent, show a lack of respect and appreciation for their customers. "

Frontier cancelled my flight because of its own equipment failure. I am having to return home by booking through another airline in order to get home today ( my original arrival date), my only other option to not spend extra money was to return 3-4 days from now. Spent 40 min on the phone to find out now refund. I will not be spending more money than I would have if I flew a decent airline. Would not wish this experience on my worst enemy."

My entire experience with Frontier was less than desirable. From having to pay in advance to ensure my young children and elderly mother were sitting with me to the astronomical baggage fees. Our pilot was an hour late getting to our flight. When asked why we were delayed and where the pilots were, the flight attendant was extremely rude and refused to answer our questions. Both departing and arriving flights had very rude attendants. Our pilot on our returning flight was very sarcastic in tone over the announcements. The check in lines at both airports (Philadelphia being the worst with only two check in attendants) were the longest lines by a landslide. Very disappointed is an understatement."

First time flying with Frontier Airlines from Philadelphia to New Orleans and there will not be a next. Had a 6.30am flight and only an hour before take-off was I informed there was a 5 hour delay. We were given a mere $10 food voucher for inconvenience. The food vouchers were clearly printed at 3.00 am - 2.5 hours before I was noticed of the delay! After this delay - and as we were ready to board, we were notified of another hour delay and then another and then at last another. We have sat for over 7 hours for this flight.

The last delay posted had departure at 9.45 pm. Finally after sitting at the airport for 5 long uncomfortable hours the flight was cancelled.

Leaving from MSP the flight was delayed by 30 minutes for a single passenger stuck in security despite having everyone else boarded. It feels like this airline cares more about the cost of putting a passenger onto another flight than the time consideration for other passengers. Whoever controlled the thermostat liked the temperature to be 60 degrees Fahrenheit for a two hour flight, which is actually three hours if you count delays while on the plane. The airline also charges for food despite massive delays. Overall it feels like this airline has no consideration for passengers aside from making it a cheap flight."

After talking at the service desk to find why the delay I found mechanical damage to the jetway. I then contacted the airline through facebook to voice my displeasure with the service. Another rep lies telling my the delay is due to weather in the flight path. Then they block me from posting on their media pages.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,January 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Orlando to Denver. We have flown Frontier Airlines for years so we have had to deal with numerous cancellations. Recently, upon arriving at the Orlando Airport at 6:00 am for an 8:00 flight to Denver, we were informed the flight was cancelled and were provided a letter that indicated we could book our own flight and be reimbursed up to $400 per person for an economy flight on another airline. Since it was critical that we get to Denver ASAP for a wedding, we followed our normal procedure and began searching for alternative flights online. Obviously, the remaining flights available were later in the day and very expensive. The cheapest we could find was $550 for each person on United that got us to Denver late that evening. Since this appeared to be our only viable option, we booked the flight with the understanding that Frontier would reimburse us $400 per ticket. After our trip, we provided the flight information and proof of cost to Frontier but they refused to reimburse us for the tickets. They said that they could only refund $165 which was the cost we paid for the cancelled flight. We have followed this procedure many times with positive results but apparently Frontier changed their policy without informing anyone so we are now out the entire $1,100 we spent on replacement tickets. Therefore, if you dare fly Frontier, don't expect to be reimbursed for any replacement tickets. They totally mislead us!"

At 7:30 the flight crew's shift ended and they went to a hotel, baggage was removed from the plane and passengers were told to retrieve it. Frontier still would not cancel the flight. Finally, we were told we could get $15 food vouchers and hotel vouchers if needed. My husband and I drove home and booked another flight on JetBlue for the next day, since the Frontier flight the following day was full. Frontier reimbursed us for the flight, and sent us a $250 voucher to get us to try their airline again. They would not cover our airport parking or anything else. Besides that, they charged for everything else - beverages, snacks, carryon bag. JetBlue was much more friendly and accommodating on our rescheduled flight."

The seats are smaller than any other plane and do not recline. For someone like myself who gets air sick reclining has been the one thing to help. They charge you for your seat I have never had that happen either. They have about 3 rows up front that do recline but they are taken ASAP and are twice as much as the seats the regular seats. They have the nerve to charge $50 for a seat in the exit row that does not even recline either. Would never fly with them again you think you are getting a good deal but by the time you are charged for seats and luggage it would have been cheaper to fly on a more comfortable airline just horrible!

They literally charge you for breathing. Word to the wise, Southwest is where it’s at for flying.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,January 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I booked a flight on Frontier Airlines from San Diego to Denver and back last weekend. I paid extra for a front row seat and a ""Bundle"" which supposedly gets you more services and a carryon. My flight to DEN on Friday, January 19, 2018 was fine. When I booked my reservation the Friday ticket was less expensive than the return on Sunday morning, so I paid extra from a front seat and $30 and a carryon $30 for both flights. The total for the ticket was $250. On Saturday afternoon, while I was at lunch with my parents, I got an email from Frontier, and the subject line was ""info"" all lower case, no big deal. Later on that evening, I looked at the email agin, and when I read it, it said that ""Your upcoming flight has been cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience this has placed on your travel plans, due to very high call volume you may make changes to your reservation for up to 2 weeks."" First of all, this is ""info""? so I booked a flight on Southwest and flew home. 2 days later I called Frontier, and he said you have a refund coming of $140. Today I see that I was credited $75. When I called customer service, they didn't care. Do not spend extra on their bundling, it's expensive and it's not refundable, even if they cancel on you. The seat upgrade was fine, but again, when they cancelled my flight, it was my bad luck that I had purchased an upgrade. Long story short, I should have booked on Southwest. Won't make that mistake again."

Milwaukee Airport was completely quiet, no other travelers around except for a Southwest flight that came in 10 minutes after but they all got their luggage right away and left. After 15 minutes of sitting at baggage claim with nothing happening, a Public announcement was made that our luggage would come in 20 - 40 minutes. It actually turned out to be 50 minutes. So our whole plane of people had to sit around for an entire hour waiting to get our luggage. No explanation, No apology and Nothing more than one public service announcement. It sure didn't feel like they care about their customer. And it really seemed obvious that they forgot to staff for our flight coming in! Nice going Frontier! Not only is your pricing misleading...who buys a ticket thinking they will need to also pay for their seat? And your seats are so uncomfortable! And you charge way too much for your checked or carry ons that the price of my ticket ended up being more than it would of been on Southwest! Now that I know all this, I will never fly Frontier again!"

For one it was easier than ever to check in and turn in checked baggage. All of the staff was more than friendly. We boarded plan 30 minutes early. Baggage claim started coming before we even arrived! They charge 3.99 for drink/snack, but you’re welcome to bring whatever you need on plane. (Liquids after security check). I read countless times about how bad the seats are. I personally think they wasn’t the best but I definitely think it’s nothing to complain about.

Looking deeper into it, Frontier even had a flight from Houston to Denver that was scheduled to land within 15 min of my canceled flight. Adding to my frustration, the earliest Frontier could get me back to DCA, was 52 hours after my scheduled arrival time. If this weren’t frustrating enough, when I went to check in for the flight (18 hours before the flight) their website was giving me errors so I was forced to call. At that time, agent confirmed my flight and asked about seating. When I asked the agent about how full the flight was, he indicated that it was “wide open, lots of available seats”, thus I chose to not pay an additional fee for an assigned seat. At 4:00 PM the day before (13 hours before scheduled departure) I received an email telling me that my flight was canceled due to “Weather”. Calling back in the Agent first told me that all flights into both Denver and Colorado Sort nags were canceled - when I pointed out that even Frontier had flights still scheduled to land at the for same time, I was told that the other planes were bigger and could handle the weather. Of course I knew that most of the planes were all very similar in size with some smaller and pointed that fact out to her. She then proceeded to tell me that they were coming from different directions so the weather wouldn’t affect those flights. At this point in time I realized that Frontier would be telling me whatever they could to get me to capitulate and just accept that 1) It was a weather delay; and 2) as such they were not responsible for the FAA required compensation. Recognizing that the flight I was on was, as they put it, was “wide open”, I suspect that Frontier was simply canceling an unprofitable flight while using weather to further reduce their costs. My fear is that this is standard practice on this “Low Fare” carrier who appears to always put their bottom line above service to their customers. In the end, I requested a refund for my flight and, although they only provided 37% of my original fare, it was better getting on the United flight that took the same route through Denver that left SLC 9 minutes after my scheduled/canceled Frontier flight. Note: I’m taking off from Denver now, on time, having had no delays in Denver on United."

The flight was on time, actually a bit early and since the plane was half empty and the flight short it was not too uncomfortable. I would not want to fly Frontier for a longer or fuller flight. The seats do not recline. I'm really curious how this helps their bottom line. Also everything including soda and pretzels costs extra. I don't mind paying for carry on since some people need to be discouraged from taking too much onto the plane. But pretzels and an assigned seat?? A seat that is not hard, ridged and non-reclining? Since there were many empty seats I think their business plan is not working."

Never flying with them again. My ticket price nearly doubled by the time I had paid for a carry on, checked bag and my seat.

Currently have an empty unused paid hotel room on the Vegas strip. Worst travel experience of my life.

There were no mechanical or weather issues. We were promised after the 5th delay to board and get in the air promptly. Then the captain and airline crew literally ran off the plane. Minutes later the desk person told us the flight was cancelled. People were irate. So what does Frontier do? Call the Police. One man was taken by the police. Because of Frontier I missed my training event. We were given $200 vouchers and re-booked for a flight 10 hrs later. I had already missed my event so there was no point in taking the later flight. An absolute joke and a poor excuse for an airline! This was my first attempt at flying Frontier and my last. How are these people still in business?

This flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to book another airline at double the price to enjoy my vacation. The alternative was to switch to a flight two days later when I was set to return home. I then find out other flights are flying into the same location 4 hours later. Why cancel the flight for a 4 hour delay? On top of that, I requested the airline to pay the difference in ticket price due to their decision to cancel rather than delay and was told no. I will never be flying Frontier again. A completely poor company with no reassurance."

My trip on Frontier was great even with the delays I had, but how can I say something about it if there was snow covering the airport. the truth is that my plane had an hour delay but arrived to destination just 5 minutes late. The pilot really found the shortcut if that is possible. about leg room. I am a 6 feet 200 pounds guy and felt comfortable. the size is the same as the one you will have when in the back seat of a sedan. The crew was amazing, yes we do not have a screen in every seat but that was easy to fix. I downloaded 3 movies in my cellphone and enjoyed top amenities thanks to Netflix downloads. Enjoy your traveling, make sure your vacations are fun and if you pay 67 dollars for a ticket as I did, do not cry for meals and entertainment in the plane, just ask for a 20 million dollar machine that will take you front point A to point B safe and fast (their airplanes are top of the line)."

No baggage counter at the CLT Airport, had to find another airline employee to go into the back to find someone. Would not deliver bag to our hotel (too far, I have never heard an airline state this), didn't matter as it took until Sunday before they ever figured where our bag was and then it took until the following Friday before they returned the bag. Absolutely horrible communications with their baggage department, they do not track any conversations, mistyped the delivery address numerous times, did not deliver the bags as promised and then fault our claim on equipment bought to make it through the weekend. Airline is cheap and poorly managed. Will not fly them again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minnesota to Denver Colorado,January 2018,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1," The passengers started to get concerned after waiting an hour without departing. Were hardly informed of what was going on until about 1.5 hours later. Flight attendants were nice but said they didn’t have a clue what was going on and couldn’t answer any questions about anyone’s connecting flight. We were told navigation wouldn’t turn on as it was a mechanical issue. We waited so long the plane had to go through 30 minute deicing a second time. Aircraft got in line only to turn around back to the gate because we ran out of gas and had to refuel. We were delayed on the tarmac for three hours, they wouldn’t let us off. Everyone missed their connecting flight. Not offered any snacks or water. We were then told to get off the plane and wait. Overall it was a 6 hour delay. Waited in line for two hours with only 1 representative working only to be told there’s nothing they can do and no refunds or connecting flights would be given. Called service line while waiting in line and told they wouldn’t refund the Frontier connecting flight ticket as well. Took no responsibility. Also told that if we get on the plane to Denver “all hotels are booked and full” with no connecting flights, so it was basically a huge gamble to go or not. Finally got to Denver told again I won’t make it to Reno for a critical doc appt. and I’m 8 months pregnant. I actually broke down crying and I told them it was unacceptable and eventually they got three of us on another airline that day but we only had 30 min to go get our luggage and go back through TSA. Baggage and our gate were at completely different ends of the airport. TSA line longer than hell. None of us had eaten all day because of Frontier and waiting in line. Again I’m 8 months pregnant running through the airport on no fuel or water. I am very physically fit with this pregnancy but after all the stress and no answers to any questions I became fatigued running through the Denver airport. One lady I was with had GI surgery and they made her run with us. We almost didn’t make it. It was the absolute worst experience I’ve ever been through. I will never fly again, ever, and letting everyone I know not to use this airline. It was appalling. Pay a little extra and make sure you get to your destination. Was offered a $200 voucher which I think is a joke."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Nashville, TN to Denver, CO",January 2018,3.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,8," Flew Nashville, TN to Denver, CO. I was pretty leery about my first flight on Frontier, they've got a serious PR issue when you see all the bad reviews online, but I couldn't pass up the great price they had for a trip I wanted to take. Yes, they can a la cart you to death, but you won't get billed for anything that you haven't agreed to, so you can't pick on them for that. You should just spend some time comparing prices to decide whether you will save money by flying on their airline. Anyway, on my flight out of town, we were delayed for 20 minutes and moved to the gate 20 feet away, but we arrived 1 minute early. On my return flight, we were fully loaded and left a couple of minutes early, then arrived about 20 minutes early. Thumbs up! The seating area is a little smaller than the last Southwest flight I flew, but my round trip flight was about $100 cheaper that the most affordable Southwest flight I could find. Also, the seats don't recline and since I'm 6' tall I was definitely wanting to stretch my legs before landing (2.5 hour flight). The flight attendants were cheerful and helpful. And most importantly, the takeoffs, flights & landings were picture perfect. Now, am I a committed devotee of Frontier after my flight? No, it's definitely a discount airline that will probably cost more than nicer flights if you have a lot of luggage, but I'm not afraid of them anymore. I'll still check Delta & Southwest first, but I tend to fly so that I can get someplace quickly & safely. They did that."

This is the cheapest airline I’ve ever flown with and they want to charge you for everything and at an outrageous price! To check in one bag with Frontier was $45. We paid $90 for two bags. Delta only charges $25, plus most other flight companies as well. The flight attendants were very kind, but come on, it’s 2018. We know you can afford to give everyone a free drink and some crackers and no charge for it. I’ve never been on an airline where they charged for all items and was actually in shock. Lastly, the seats do not adjust at all. You want to lean back a little and take a nap? Not going to happen! I actually fell asleep sitting up and my head landed on the shoulder of the man sitting next to me so my fiancé had to move my head onto his shoulder. The seats were hard and covered by plastic/leather material and not cloth so that just added to the uncomfortable part, also made me cold! Frontier is an airline I will never fly on again. Our flight out to Mexico was with Delta and it went perfectly. Direct flight, enjoyed a coffee, leaned back to take a quick nap on a comfortable seat, and the stewards were very kind as well. I will definitely make sure Expedia doesn’t sign us up for different flight companies next trip!"

Tickets were cheap, with two one way tickets running us about $200 total. Baggage is a little expensive, around $35 for carry ons and checked, but backpacks count as personal items and are free to carry on. I arranged to bring my emotional support animal and they were amazing about it. After emailing them verification they got back to me within 2 days and updated my account to show accommodations. No issues at all at the airport or on the plane. I do have to say you get what you pay for in some aspects though. We had a 5 hour layover in Denver, there isn't free food or drinks on the plane ($2 per cash only), and the ticket counter before security only opened up 1.5 hours before our 11am flight. But if all that's okay you'll be happy here and save a lot of money flying with them!"

As we landed in Denver, the same thing happened and we had to wait again for a lane to open for our plane again! I don't understand how that happens twice in a row but Frontier is very unprofessional, this isnt the first time this has happened to me with Frontier. I would not recommend Frontier to any of my friends or family, sometimes people have places to be for jobs and work, and delaying the flight could cost them their job not to mention the bad service."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Las Vegas,December 2017,4.0,4.0,,,,1.0,2,no,3,"  Milwaukee to Las Vegas. The 9:30 Milwaukee flight was delayed an hour and a half which resulted in an arrival in Las Vegas at 3am (Milwaukee time) instead of 1:30am. I understand situations happen and appreciate a delay for safety reasons, so I didn't think much of the delay except I was tired. On the flight home, we departed Las Vegas on time, but when we arrived in Milwaukee early but we sat in the airplane for over an hour because the airline was short ground crew staff. I assumed this couldn't be a coincidence and found out later the flight leaving Milwaukee was also delayed because of not having enough ground crew. This is not acceptable. Frontier is putting their own profit ahead of their customers comfort. My daughter has a friend that works on a ground crew at Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee. Her friend said it is common place for Frontier to have too few people working on the ground crew to keep up with incoming and outgoing flights. The flight was cheap, and the pilot and flight crew were pleasant. To some it is worth the price to get delayed flights and being left on the plane for extended periods of time. It isn't to me."

Today on my flight back to Orlando we boarded the plane late. Were supposed to depart at 1:30pm and didn’t begin leaving until 3:00pm . Ridiculous and the communication is horrible, at least let us know what’s going on not let us sit for hours not knowing anything. Overall the worst flight ever and I’d never fly with them again.

I really had wished that would be the case this time around when making a quick trip to Minneapolis for a New Year's concert. This was far from the case. After loading everyone onto the plane, nearly about to take off at 535 in the morning January first there was a maintenance issue which caused us to be delayed until 10 am, with no notification or updates. We had our flight cancelled around noon, after waiting in limbo. Not only that but the rep working was not trained, technically not even a frontier employee but rather from a third party service and she was incredibly rude. We had an emergency at home and needed to try to get there asap, we were exhausted and frustrated with the service and we had to spend about two hours trying to get rebooked and a hotel voucher. They didn't put us on a flight until two days out,and refused us a second day voucher. Instead of arguing further we cancelled our return flight for a refund and had to rent a car to drive home. I will never fly frontier again due to how we were treated in one of the most stressful situations possible."

Thought I should try a “budget” airline and I totally regret it. Flight was delayed 9 hours for maintenance. This sucks but is understandable. Problem was all passengers were given no info as gate agent left as people started or get frustrated. Customer service on phone was out of country and confused. Even going to the extent to say the flight was leaving at 2.17 when it was 2.45. Very disappointing. Also plane was really hot and the seats were uncomfortable.

I will take responsibility for this due to my own lack of research and assuming there were no carry on fees or seat assignment fees. In return I would like Frontier Airlines to take responsibility for the flight from hell that many of us encountered. There were 3 gate changes and a 5 hour delay including sitting at the gate for over an hour after we were boarded. Nothing was offered to us to make any of us more comfortable. Not even a drink of water. The air quality on the plane was horrible. It was hot, stuffy, and stale. The worst part were the bathrooms. They were filthy. The floors were covered in sticky wet urine that we were forced to step in if we needed to use the restroom. Instead of the flight attendant just standing around staring back at us she could tidy up the restrooms so they are suitable for us. I did pay for a service and do expect my money to count for something other than getting me from point A to point B. I thought possible included in the flight were clean facilities for the passengers and quality air to breathe. I did call customer service asking for some type of compensation other than a $25 voucher to fly with them again and was denied. I will never use that $25 voucher because I don't plan on flying with Frontier again. I expect some sort of standards when I fly and for the airline to take some pride in what they do. Because the flight arrived the next day, I also had to pay for additional parking. Frontier offered nothing. So disappointed in this airline."

Issues with their online booking system (not on my end) caused $400 in extra fees, making it more expensive than a full service airline. When I called to resolve the issue, the only other option given is to cancel with no refund. The extra baggage fees are crazy, and no one ever checked for a receipt to show I had paid. If you want to be sure your children can be next to you, they force you to pay for your seat assignment. My son was seated away from us by himself, even though he was booked with my family and has the same last name. They would only move us together if I paid an additional $60 each seat for my family of 4. The seats have no padding, are seriously uncomfortable, are even closer than normal, and do not lean back at all. Snacks and sodas are additional $5 or more each."

So my trip to Minneapolis was not bad, pilot flew the plane great, flight attendant was great. What I didn't like is that I felt there was no professionalism, staff was on their phone chit chatting not paying attention. Anyway this was my first flight on Frontier and it will be the last, they charge you fees for everything, the luggage I could understand but what I don't get is why charge me for seat assignment. Isn't that why i bought my ticket. I was flying with my two younger daughters (8 and 2 year old) and I had to spend an extra $300 round trip and that's only for luggage and seat assignment, so in all I paid $900 for all three of us. I chose them because of how inexpensive their prices were, but I guess you pay for what you get. To top it off, they lost my baggage on a straight flight, that makes no sense what so ever. Anyways Frontier has lost me as a customer and I will pay the extra money for Delta or Jetblue that gives you free luggage, free seat selection, free snacks on board and excellent customer service. They deserve a -1 in my books."

I am supposed to be at SLC at around 11.30 pm, but now I am writing this review because my flight does not leave DEN until 12.15 am. The only thing I hope for now is “no more delays” on Christmas. I already received 4 texts regarding flight delays. Another thing I really hate about this company - they charge for seat assignment. If I don’t pick a seat (about $10-$25 per each flight), the company assign any available seat randomly. This is my last flight with Frontier."

When it came time to check in online, it wouldn’t allow me the option to check my bags after several attempts. I got to the airport to check my bags and the fee was a whopping $45 for the first bag and $35 for the carryon and they don’t accept cash. The rates would have been slightly cheaper for checking in online, I explained to the clerk that I tried to check in several times online and it wouldn’t let me. She gave me a number to call. I got my boarding pass and I got to the gate and it didn’t have a seat assignment so I had to get out of line and wait to be issued and new boarding pass. So the flight was actually more expensive than the other flights after they charge high rates for your bags. Never flying Frontier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Salt Lake City via Denver,December 2017,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Overall terrible experience from Milwaukee to Salt Lake City via Denver. Our first flight was delayed 3 hours, 1 of which was spent sitting on the plane waiting to take off unable to use the bathroom. Our connecting flight was delayed even longer with terrible communication from the staff for both flights. This experience, on top of their already uncomfortable, cramped seats and numerous hidden fees means they will never again get my business."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to San Antonio,December 2017,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  New Orleans to San Antonio. Christmas Day my return flight is 2 hr 53 min delayed. No issues with flight here last week. They can’t fly me out on another airline because they aren’t affiliated with any. The phone customer service people are those outsourced overseas help desk people. They have no stake in customer satisfaction because they aren’t invested in the company. This ticket was half the price of the Southwest Airlines one but you get what you pay for. This was my first and last time I am ever flying this airline. You can’t run a company like this. On the mobile app, no indication or information about flight delay. No customer service at the gate and no display at the gate to let folks know there is a delay or what to do. In flight - They sell you a credit card on the flight. You have to pay for everything, they won’t even bring you water. I paid $25 to upgrade my seat and it was comfortable."

Seats are too small,  you have to buy any snacks or drinks, have to pay for carry on bags. That being said this was my first and last time using this airline. Plane was one hour late - once we did board there was a customer that would not comply and instead of removing him on the spot so the rest of us could get home on Christmas Eve they waited about 30 mins until 2 NYPD officers came on and took the person off. That put us basically 2 hours late from departing. Being in the Military I have used pretty much every airline there is and this is by far the worst. Traveling is expensive already but to charge for something that should be complimentary is absurd. Not a big review person but this was the most horrible flying experience in my life. Never again Frontier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Denver,December 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Milwaukee to Denver. I don’t typically leave reviews, but as a first time Frontier customer, this will surely be my last. To elaborate a bit more, our flight was at 6:30 PM, in which we arrived at 4:00 PM (knowing it was be extremely busy for the holidays). At check in we came to find one employee working the desk, with a line that wrapped around the airport. Note, the other airlines had multiple employees, but only Frontier had an actual line. After waiting about 1 hour and 15 minutes, we were able to get through security (a breeze). The aircraft eventually arrived late, and we were boarded without any issues. Now as we speak, it is 7:39 PM and we have just been informed by the attendant that the employees “are short staffed” and it will be another 30 minutes until employees can actually help come load the luggage. It has now been over an hour and the aircraft is extremely warm. Many people have asked for water or ice due to the heat and the Frontier attendants are extremely unkind. A mother asked for water for her toodler and she was completely denied. I doubt we will be leaving anytime soon, as the employees are all busy chatting and laughing in the front of the aircraft while the passangers all suffer. Additionally, don’t be fooled by the low prices. Space is tight, luggage is very expensive and there are many hidden fees. I guess there’s a reason why frontier lands itself in last place for the quality rating. Quality is something that this airline seriously lacks!"

While flying Frontier Airlines last February, the stewardess convinced me to sign up for their frequent flier program. She said it's the best program and miles don't expire. So I paid $80 to sign up for their credit card. To my surprise, I logged in my account the other day and saw that on December 14th, my miles had ""expired!"". When I demanded to know what happened, they said I could have them back if I paid them more money! I will never use this company again!"

I flew Frontier Airlines to take my 4 month old daughter home for the first time. We arrived at our destination to find that our stroller was broken to the point we could no longer snap our car seat in. We had this stroller for 4 months and now it is ruin beyond use. Of course I called to let them know, they told me to file a claim which I did. Their response was that they would not replace my stroller but they hope we fly with them again. This is my first and last time flying with this airline. They don’t take into consideration their customers personal belongings. Plus the seats were hard and very uncomfortable. If you plan to fly this airline, good luck and I would just suggest you take another airline."

Frontier has more hidden fees than I have encountered flying. You book your ticket for a seemingly low price. When it's time to check in they charge you not only for your checked luggage (like every airline) but also your carry on. Not only that, they charge you per seat per flight to select a seat. With adding luggage, carry on and 4 seats later it's an additional 200 bucks minimum. I will never fly Frontier again. At least be upfront about your cost prior to booking."

I arrived at the airport 1hr and 44 minutes prior to flight, the line to check bags was 1 hr 30 long with only two staff at the counter. A Frontier representative came through and asked all passengers on the Providence flight to go to the front of the line - so we did. When we got there other passengers were screaming and swearing at us, it was mayhem. I don't blame the other passengers for being angry. I blame the Frontier rep for not escorting us and taking control of the situation. The prices are very good but the logistics at check in are very slow."

So I called today and the agent told me that there's nothing they can do for me, I'm very unhappy and I will never book with Frontier Airlines again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Atlanta,December 2017,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Cheap air fair, but the customer care is horrendous. I had a flight from Atlanta to Austin, $77 round trip. Seemed unbelievable (as I should have known, it was). Beyond just uncomfortable seating, they do not care about what is best for their customers. I had my flight scheduled but it was canceled due to snow hitting GA. If you know anything about the south, we don't get snow often. So when we do, everyone goes crazy, despite Atlanta only getting a few inches. Something I would assume these planes are equipped for since they fly to cities like Chicago and New York during the winter months. So, I had taken time off work but wound up rescheduling my flight for the following weekend, leaving me to take off even more time from work but I didn't see this as a major downfall if it meant visiting a close friend. Well, of course, this weekend happened to be the weekend Hartsfield Jackson had a power outage. So here I am again, dealing with another canceled flight from Frontier--despite the fact that the power returned Sunday night and my plane wasn't landing until 2pm on Monday. Other airlines were still flying in on Monday, yes maybe the power outage only affected certain airlines but I am still unsure as to why Frontier had to cancel on Monday when everything was fixed Sunday night. So, Frontier gives me the option of rebooking my flight for no additional costs. Awesome! Nope. The next flight they could offer me was on Friday with a connecting flight in Denver (sounds like too many hours on a Frontier plane already, right?). Plus it wasn't realistic for me to stay five additional days! Money is needed and I can only make money if I work but alas, I cannot work if I am not in Georgia. Frontier offers to give me a refund. For $33. If you travel frequently, you know $33 isn't going to do jack shit for a last minute flight home the week of Christmas. To fly out on Monday tickets were as ""cheap"" as $800. I wound up booking a flight for Tuesday for $280. Frontier then offered me a $50 voucher. As if I ever want to fly with them again. I called and spoke with a supervisor to see if they could give me a refund or compensate for my flight. He told me repeatedly that it ""wasn't their fault,"" and I politely reminded him that the power outage was not my fault either, nor was the $280 ticket I had to buy home. He demeaned me by reminding me that a $50 voucher along with a $33 refund is more than what I spent in the first place--as if I could not do that math on my own. I understood that fully but that voucher still wasn't helping me with the extra $280 I had to pay out of pocket around the holidays. He refused to give me a full refund, despite me saying I would prefer that over the voucher, and continued to speak down to me as if I did not understand that the power outage wasn't their fault. Not only were they not willing to work with me, each person I spoke with treated me as if I were an idiot and didn't understand the circumstances. The man kept reiterating that this was a loss for Frontier too. Well, it's going to continue to be an even bigger loss for them if they continue to treat their customers like this. I will never fly with Frontier again. Spend the extra $100, fly with Delta. They seem to be handling the power outage with grace and dignity. Maybe Frontier could learn a thing or two from them if they really want a chance at being a big airline."

Tickets are inexpensive but the ticket we bought my granddaughter was purchased a week after us on the phone she is 3 years old. The lady on the phone said she was linked to me an adult on the plane. When we got to Austin they said it wasn’t linked to me but she put her with one of the adults in our party. On our way back from Ontario the airline would not sit her with one of us, they said it was a full flight! Then they said I could get a seat next to her but I had to pay for a preferred seatt! That they expect a 3 year old to be able to ride on a plane by themselves! The supervisor said her children minors fly by themselves. As a supervisor you need to use common sense. If you let your 3 year old fly by themselves I don’t only question your common sense but your parenting also."

Bought a ticket to get to Austin at a specific time for an appointment, landed on time then had to wait to go to a gate for an hour and 15 mins. Missing my appointment.

Not many airlines deserve for some to say this about them, but I hope they shut down, and do some work on their coordination. Unacceptable."

To top it all off once arrived to destination they made us sit for another hour because another plane was docked at our gate. What a terrible experience. I wish they would do things for customers and passengers instead of leaving a bad taste in there mouths.

During time of purchase of an upgrade and also during check in I tried to apply my KTN for pre-TSA, and it said that the front desk at the airport will be able to add my number for me. Getting to my flight 90 minutes before my flight, the front desk employees said they were “too busy” to put my KTN in. This wouldn’t be so frustrating if I didn’t register for pre-tsa to avoid having to go through the General Security line. Frontier reminded me of why customer service goes such a long way. I won’t be flying Frontier again and will tell others my experience."

Frontier is the worst airline in business. They charge you for the flight obviously, but then you have to pay $45 for your checked bag, $50 for the second, $25 for a carry on and so on. If you want a water or soda, have your credit card ready. Nothing is free. I'm surprised they don't charge you for oxygen, life vest, restroom use, etc. The flight crews were miserable from the Captain down to the flight attendants. It felt more like Con Air. They make it seem like a cost efficient way to travel, but I would rather walk without shoes in a snowstorm for 500 miles. The seats are like sitting on concrete and don't recline. We will never ever fly with them again. Not worth it! Flying Southwest or Delta would have been a better choice."

I bought my tickets thinking I got a half decent deal. I was incorrect. Airfare cost $66 and change, which is great! But the taxes and carrier imposed fees cost me nearly double. if you include the $18 I had to pay for my seats it is even closer to double. Secondly, the airline charges you for literally everything. No refreshments and no nibbles. No Wi-Fi, and no leg room. The only reason I bought the tickets I did was for a last minute interview that was scheduled prior to relocation to Salt Lake City. Had I known about the financial fisting I would receive I would have went with an airline that at least offered me a snack and a drink before bending me over. At least the Flight Attendants were pleasant. You're fired forever Frontier; maybe one day I will have the pleasure of witnessing the airline going bankrupt."

After a fun filled four days in New Orleans, my 74 year old mother was feeling worn out. She had hurt herself and hurt her knee. So, I checked us in with a wheelchair box marked to ensure Mom would not have to walk. We arrived to the airport almost 2 hr early and the agent greeted us with a cheery smile & checked our luggage. There wasn’t a line but a steady flow of customers. We watched him for a long time as after 40 minutes and 3 calls no wheelchair person had come. He was so cheerful & great in his customer interactions that every passenger walked away smiling. Since I had explained I couldn’t push Mom & take our coats etc. he took us himself when no one else ever came. He was reassuring & got us to the gate just in time for our flight. He is an asset to the staff at Frontier. In a strange twist, there was a medical emergency on our flight. While I can’t remember the attendants names, I must say, they were on it. I was a nurse on a medical surgical floor and this is the fast kind of response needed. Fortunately, there were two Dr’s on board but all in all the whole experience impressed. We’ve been to over 50 countries & fly all the time, this was one of the best airline experiences we have had. I paid $19.40 for these tickets. For all these low star reviews I say, don’t expect luxury for pennies and when it counted frontier staff acted just as they should and super professionally! "

Not having anybody from the airline to talk to, to at least find out what the problem was, 4 hrs later they showed up with a few pizzas, trying to buy you out, and still coming out with lies because apparently nobody knew what was going on.

If you are smart (which I was not-- I booked thinking it would be fine for such a short flight), don't fly this airline. Nothing was good about this airline. You get what you pay for and in this case you think you are getting a good deal, but in the end with all their charges you are not getting a good deal. The website did not work--booking for the wrong date and trying to get you to book more expensive seats when I picked a cheaper one. I finally had to leave the website and book on another website. I actually wonder if the website purposely books the wrong day so you will have to pay more money. They charge for everything, even a back pack to carry on! There was not even an agent at the gate and people were just standing there waiting to check in (8:30am). The agents at the airport were rude although the reservation agents on the phone were more professional. I never complain about poor service, but this was such a bad experience, I wanted others to know what to expect. I am sure they will not change or improve their practices as a result of this review--they are not classy enough to do that. I just want warn others before they waste money! As others have said in these reviews (I wish I had read them), fly with a real airline. There motto is something like ""Economy airline done right"" - that is a huge joke. It is an example of just the opposite."

Frontier told us to take our checked bags through the TSA screening. Mins pass by as they consult if they can let the bag through. After viewing the x-ray back and forth they said I had to remove 5-10 items. By the time we got the ones that we needed to discard out our terminal gates closed right in front of our eyes. We were a family of 4 along with 8 other passengers were left stranded and all accounted for in front of the gate. Now tell me how does Frontier let this happen to 12 people on Thanksgiving Day? I called 801-401-9000 (frontier customer service) and customer service rep said “This May be a special day for you but it’s just another day for us at Frontier.” That really was the tipping point. We are all looking for a good deal but if the trade off is to be treated like you're non-existent is unacceptable. Their front counter staff to the customer service support number should be fired if not retrained. When you’re at the counter and the agent is more concerned with what’s going on in her Facebook and Snapchat to even look at you in the eye, you’re in trouble."

For the price I paid it was worth it. If I have anything to complain about is the cost of inflight drinks. A small bottle of water or a can of soda for $3.00? That is a bit too extreme, and, if you don’t have a debit/credit card you’re out of luck. Aside from the above issues, my biggest complaint is that the seats don’t recline and that the airline nickel and dime you for everything. I will not get used to paying for a carry on bag."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Omaha to San Francisco via Denver,November 2017,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,1,"  Omaha to San Francisco via Denver. Couldn't get a working boarding pass. After I checked in on your website using my laptop, I never got an email confirmation with a boarding pass as I do with all other airlines. So, I logged back in to your website and went to print the boarding pass, but since I didn't have a printer, I just took a screenshot and sent that to my phone. I arrived at the airport 45 minutes before the flight with just a laptop back. I thought I'd go to the check-in counter and get a proper boarding pass just in case, but the woman said that it was closed and she had no way to print a boarding pass. I checked my phone and it was exactly 45 minutes before the departure time. So, I went to security and tried to use my screen shot of the boarding pass and we couldn't make it work. I then went back to the website using my phone and I couldn't find any way pull up the boarding pass again. TSA said they couldn't let me in with a boarding pass that would scan. So, I went back down to the check-in counter and was told again that they had no way to print a boarding pass as they were completely locked out 45 minutes before the flight. And, the one self check-in kiosk was broken. The woman the check-in counter was absolutely unhelpful. Her only suggestion was that I buy a ticket for the United flight that was leaving 15 minutes later. I didn't even get a sincere apology. There was a guy standing around and I'm still not sure if he worked for Frontier or not as he didn't have a uniform, but he heard what was going on and suggested I install your app. After a few minutes getting that setup, I was finally able to get a boarding pass on my phone that worked and I made my flight just a couple of minutes before the doors closed. I've been flying 30 to 50 flights a year for the past 40 years and while I've had problems in the past, I've never seen such a complete breakdown of the check-in process as this. First, I should have received a boarding pass in my email (yes, you had the right email address and no it didn't go to my junk mail). Second, it's ridiculous that your agent can't print a boarding pass 45 minutes before a flight departs even when a customer is not checking a bag. Third, there should be at least one working kiosk that can print the pass. Fourth, there should be an obvious way to view the boarding pass on the website. I had been able to on my laptop by clicking the check-in button, but when I opened the browser on my phone, even though I had already checked in that button was disabled (I supposed again because of the 45 minute issue). I can't afford to miss flights because the airline can't figure out it's check-in system and I'm done flying Frontier."

In Houston, we ran into a situation were all lanes of traffic were blocked. My husband had dropped his Driver's License in the San Jose International Airport, who'd sent us a picture and told us to arrive early for our return flight for extra screening on our return flight. Since the lanes were blocked, and there was no way around that, we pre-boarded while stuck on the road. After advising TSA that we would be late for our flight soon, they went into sloth-mode, calling a supervisor who didn't appear for 10 minutes. My husband provided the necessary alternative forms of ID listed on TSA's own requirements, and they proceeded to pat him down, etc. We ran, arriving at the Frontier gate to board 12 minutes before our flight was to depart. We were told the gate would close 10 min prior. There were no employees at the desk, and there was no way to reach them. We ran to the next gate and asked what to do. They told us to knock on the door to the gangway. We pounded on the door until we saw our plane take off. Then the employees came in, and we explained our situation. They offered to fly us out 2 days later. That was all they would offer. It took 2 minutes for them to make that decision, and they said they had no sister airline to accommodate us sooner. We offered to fly into San Francisco or Oakland. Still, they said, they had nothing. I called their call center at 5.40am, and spoke to another country who had nothing to offer, and didn't even check to see if there were earlier flights. This airline clearly wasn't trying to reschedule us, and did want to keep our money, which is what they did do. It doesn't behoove them to accommodate us, because they already have our money. We were forced to buy tickets on another airline for $700 in order to get home in time to meet our obligations of work and childcare in San Jose. Frontier doesn't care. TSA doesn't care. Does any airline care?"

I got to the airport for my 6:30 flight over 2 hours early. The line for luggage checking was ridiculously long with only 3 people checking bags. We were told only certain lines were for certain flights, but nothing was labeled so new people coming had no clue what they were supposed to do. One line they later said wasn't a line. When we got to the counter they told us we were in the wrong line (after having waited an hour). The desk staff was extremely rude and unorganized for such a large airport. Then at our gate, 20 min after boarding should have started they tell us the plane just landed from Cancun and there was a security check that would last at least 20 min. (Except the fact the plane was already at the gate 30 mins,  or more before that) the flight was delayed over 45 min, for a 6:30am flight. What an absolutely terrible experience. I will never fly them again."
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Las Vegas via Denver,November 2017,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,2," Washington to Las Vegas via Denver. I describe Frontier Airlines as ""they get you there"". I say this because the planes are uncomfortable and the flight plans are pretty rough, especially if you are buying tickets during a promotion. The promotional times generally cover weekdays, less Friday. And the flight plans during those days generally involve stopping in Denver, which could be 1 hour or up to 3 hours. Denver airport is very big, and comfortable, but it is a pain to stopover for west-bound travel. I do recommend the cheap $20 travel insurance. There seems to be a high incidence of delays with flights. My flight from Las Vegas was delayed by a half hour because of crew issues. My flight from San Francisco the week prior was cancelled because of the pilot thinking there was a huge maintenance issue. The cancellation resulted in my wife and I getting $200 vouchers, which I guess was a result of having the travel insurance. $400 free, great. But now we have to fly with Frontier again, and I have to use the vouchers within 3 months of issuance (ugh). Frontier is a budget airline, and I get what that involves - fees for everything. I just wish that they would be a bit more focused on their budget status. Budget airline implies they want to fly as many minutes possible and be on the ground as few minutes as possible. Meaning, the quicker it takes to load the plane the more money they make since they can fly more. I would like to know if European airlines do this, but Frontier should be different from all the standard airlines and load the plane from the back first instead of by zone, mostly front first. Yes, I understand that this may result in the people who pay for seat upgrades (which are in the first 5 rows of the plane) to possibly lose the ability to stow their carry-on because of limited bin space, but perhaps they should force people who take the cheap option (like me) to check their baggage. Already there is a $5 incentive to check baggage when you buy tickets. It is usually $30 to carry-on a bag and $25 to check it. I chose to save those $5 and checked one big bag for my wife and I. They should make the incentive bigger for the cheap-minded passengers, like $15 or something because there are still too many people carrying bags on, and carry-ons slow down the boarding process. Perhaps they should setup a system wherein they limit the number of carry-on purchases based on bin space, with priority given to those who pay for seat upgrades. Like other budget airlines, everything comes at a cost - $10 for not printing a boarding pass at home (rarely enforced), cost for food on-board, cost for upgraded seats, cost for selecting a seat at check-in (if you must select a seat for free, you need to do it early and you are limited to the center seat in the last 10 rows or so). Just select no seat and let the system do it for you. The worst part of frontier is the seat. The width and the leg room are pretty standard, and the seat base cushion is fine, but the seat back is horrible. It is a layer of plastic covered by a thin layer of padding and then a thin layer of leather. And the backs don't recline. It is super uncomfortable to try sleeping. The trays are small, so good luck putting your head down. The next time I fly Frontier (which will be the last time I fly, thanks to the vouchers) I will pay for the seat upgrade to the front 5 rows which are more like Delta's seats, comfortable and they recline."

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Orlando Intl,November 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  I've flown countless times on what I've heard to be the worst airlines while in the marine corps, never really cared about comfort or TVs. Anyways I'm a veteran now flying with a car seat and a 7 month baby that I couldn't even comfort because they separated my family. This was the first and last time flying Frontier. Between last minute check-in bag fees and the treatment we received I felt I had to leave a review. Never flew on a plane that felt unsafe as soon as we took off. I stood awake my entire flight from California to Florida because the seats could not recline. The plane had no TVs for children, no free refreshments, small seats, barely any leg room, stiff hard chairs, rude staff and dirty bathrooms. We brought a car seat onto the plane and after 80% of people loaded we finally started to board and set up the car seat with two crying babies. Then we were told the car seat had to go in a window seat but I didn't have a window seat so it took them about 15 mins to find someone to move us to a seat with a window only to separate my family so the baby can be seated with his mom while I sat on another row. Last but not least out of all the airlines I've been to they always allow mothers or parents with car seats to get situated first so they can have time to set up the car seat but the rude flight attendant said ""I understand but we need you to sit down and buckle your seatbelt""."

The flight is comfortable. I paid extra $20 to seat at 2nd row, but my carry-on baggage can not be put on row 2 cabinets which is reserved for row 1 seats even though there are spaces available, and row 3 cabinets are all full because passengers boarded first, I was forced to put my carry-on bag under seat and couldn't stretch my legs, or put it far away from my seat. This is the first time I couldn't use cabinets on top of my seats on an airplane after more than 40 years traveling around world, and it's the first time I take Frontier airlines."
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Las Vegas,October 2017,4.0,4.0,,,,3.0,5,yes,9,"  This was my first time flying on Frontier from Miami to Las Vegas. They are a no frills, nothing included airline. My ticket cost was only $50, but I added the full upgrade package for another $99 which included being able to chose my seat (any seat) and free bags. Otherwise everything else is a secondary charge. They do not serve free refreshments on board and have no inflight entertainment. With that said, because I upgraded my ticket, I was able to chose one of the extra space seats in the first few rows. These are the only seats that recline on the plane, all other seats do not. Because of that, I was relatively comfortable. My flight left on time, and arrived as scheduled. The flight crew seemed friendly, although I did not need their services. Overall my experience was satisfactory. Had I been in any of the standard seats, that did not recline, I am sure my experience would have been not as pleasant. This would be the only way I fly Frontier again."

Was told couldn't land due to weather was staying in the air and would circle back around. About 30 to 40 minutes later we landed in Louisville without any notice of landing else where. When landed plane was swirving on the runway. When pulled up was no where near any gates or was not able to get to a gate because of where the plane landed. Was told had to refuel and that the plane lost its navigation system. No one could leave but if had to had to sign a waiver and no return. The plane had to be shut down to reboot the navigation system so had to sit on the plan for 15 to 20 minutes in the pitch dark. When finally leaving several hours later take off was horrible and the plane kept going up and dropping tremendously you were lifted out of your seat, the plane was making all kinds of noises. When landing 30 minutes later the pilot did no announcement of landing. So instead of landing at 9:30ish landed finally at 2:45am. As soon as landed and I turned my phone on there was an email with a $50 voucher. I called for a refund of the return flight, I explained the flight and how horrible and scary it was. But no refund and thought for all that and having to miss a days work that was more than the round trip a $50 voucher was enough. Needless to say it's useless to me, I will never fly with them again. I should have listened about what people said and regulations they'd been in trouble for. Worst experience ever. I'd rather pay more for a safer flight and better customer service."

We had a very long wait and an hour and a half into standing in line it was apparent it would be close in catching our flight. We called the airline begging they wait, no help. We made it to gate at 12:30 and our flight that was supposed to leave at 12:40 was gone, not one attendant around to help. We had purchased travel insurance but this is of no use we are out the $800. We called because our checked bag went to Milwaukee on the flight we didn't make they told us that someone would be in Milwaukee at the baggage claim to get our checked bag to us. They don't even have a baggage claim window we had to wait by ticketing. Traveling with 2 children and all the waits and frustration they caused is beyond ok."

✅ Verified Review ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Denver,October 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1," Frontier Airlines is, in every applicable way, the very worst of what an already shaky industry has to offer. They manage to get it pitifully wrong both before and during flights. First, don't be fooled by Frontier's flights landing among the cheapest offered by aggregators such as KAYAK. These prices fail to take into account costs such as $45 for a single checked bag and no complementary food or beverage offerings except water. So overall, the value of a Frontier ticket is at the very bottom -- and that's with all else about the experience assumed to be equal. But in fact, their customer service is even worse than their duplicitous pricing. On a recent flight from Denver to Providence, the desk clerk gave me a receipt but no boarding pass, which I failed to notice because they look similar. As I result I was turned back at security. This might have been forgivable had the agent I dealt with back at check-in - a different employer than the one who had screwed up earlier - not been unaccountably scornful, as if I'd been the one who's screwed up. Given that I was close to missing my flight, I certainly didn't need the added stress of this person's contempt. On my return flight two weeks later, I experienced some sudden GI distress about halfway through the four-hour ride, so I got up to use the lavatory. As I approached the back of the plane, one of the flight attendants snapped, ""Sir, the fasten seat belts sign is lit."" As I gestured and started to plead my case, the flight attendant repeated herself, droid-like in her monotonic replies. I went back to my seat, but in all honesty I almost wish I'd had an ""accident"" right there in the aisle so that this cheerless automaton would have had to clean it up. (Soon afterward, the same flight attendant was very enthusiastic about trying to hector me into applying for a credit card.) There is also no Internet service, not even for the usual exorbitant rates. Did I mention that my previous experience with Frontier was almost as bad? Stay away from this outfit. Even when I despise something I'm generally too lazy to note my disappointment online, reserving my rare reviews for strong praise. But in this case, having discerned that this company's business model resembles that of low-end, worthless cellular carriers, I feel compelled to warn off as many travellers as possible. Frontier deserves to fail."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Minneapolis ,October 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flew Orlando to Minneapolis. My experience was horrible. When we first checked in our bags we were told that we didn’t have seats. Which I still fathom to understand because I booked my tickets in July and paid for 2 seats. I don’t understand how at that time we didn’t have seats. We were told they overbooked the flight. The employees at the gate were horrible. Beyond not providing any information to us, and not keeping us informed they seemed to bot care less of what was going on. When they started boarding I again asked do we have tickets, and they said not at this time, so we continued to sit there, not going to the bathroom, not eating or getting water for fear they’d call our name and we wouldn’t be there. The flight was supposed to leave at 7.55am and didn’t leave until 8.15am because of us. Also when getting on the plane they told us my 9 year old daughter and I wouldn’t be sitting together. I truly have no respect for Frontier and will never fly with them again. I was thoroughly disappointed and have never been treated so poorly. Even when we were getting on the plane as my daughter was worried we weren’t sitting together I pulled out my wallet as I planned to offer money to someone for their seat. The flight attendant said it shouldn’t come to that, but I said well it shouldn’t have come to this since I paid for 2 tickets but you overbooked the flight. She proceeded to tell me, she didn’t overbook the flight. We were the last to board after they asked several times for people to volunteer to get off. I legitimately walked up to the counter while the flight attendants were laughing at the fact that the flight was overbooked. I interrupted the conversation by telling them that yes, we were some of those that don't currently have seats. The gate agent took my tickets and told me to have a seat. "
✅ Verified Review ,A321,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Trenton to Orlando,October 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  It is unacceptable the flight to Orlando on Tuesday 17th (flight 1775) was delayed 4 hours. It is unacceptable that they did not notify anyone on that flight until after arrival at the Trenton airport, and then misinformed everyone as to the reason for the delay. Couple that with delay of our return trip from Orlando on the 21st (again misinforming everyone about the nature of the delay) is again unacceptable. The reality of the delay is that they had two flights scheduled to leave Orlando from the same terminal gate at the same time to different airports and chose to have the flight to Philadelphia (flight 1672) depart on time and delay fight 1776 to Trenton (for their own convenience) and apparently instructed their gate attendant to lie to your customers, again unacceptable. In the case of our return trip we were rebooked onto flight 1672 to Philadelphia causing us additional travel expense to drive to Trenton from Philadelphia to retrieve our car. Never again and I will tell everyone I know not to travel on Frontier airlines."

Then there weren’t any complimentary beverage or snacks, you had to pay $3+ for a soda and chips. Not to mention we couldn’t even get our bags checked until 2 hours exactly from when our flight takes off. With having kids you want to make sure you are at your gate in 2-3 hours of take off so you have that time frame. I will never be flying with them. My $430 ticket turned out to be $850."

Additionally we gate checked a stroller and car seat. Now I’ve flown a lot - and on normal airlines as soon as you get off the plane the gate checked items are there waiting for you to pick them up. Well not on this airline. Practically the entire flight was deplaned before the gate checked items stated to appear. What was the hold up? Again no explanation.

There were 14 customers (all unrelated) that were standing there at the counter in the same situation. We all received a text indicating the delayed time of departure. Security had to come to the counter because of all the unhappy customers. Frontier employees admitted it was a ""glitch"" in their system. I had to get a hotel for the night and pay for baggage with the other airline. I filed a dispute on-line with Frontier and they said they would give me a $50 voucher.

I grew up as a pilot's kid and flew all over as a kid.  I was happy to see what looked like a new A321 with the latest Frontier livery on the exterior along with the winglets. Online check-in was easy. Had boarding pass in hand. The ticket was around 25 dollars, and I paid another 95 dollars for a carry on and one checked bag. My carry on was a backpack for my laptop/wallet/phone misc items. Because I sat in 1F my book bag had to get stowed in the overhead compartment. I think this is an FAA rule, but for the life of my it makes no sense. Window seat with no emergency door, no one is going to trip over my book bag in an emergency. But not the airline's fault. The interior appeared very new, seats modern. Seat comfort was ok, only a little over 2 hours. Had this been a three hour or longer flight, this could be uncomfortable. Seats are pretty hard, despite how cool they look. I let everyone else board first, pretty much, and stretched out in the terminal for as long as possible. I declined any in flight purchases. Brought my own snacks. People complain about having to pay for bags, carry-on bag restrictions, having to pay for food in flight etc, but the ticket is only 25 bucks, go find somewhere else to complain. After climbing through 10,000 feet they did give me back my book bag. This experience was great. Unfortunately my return leg is with another airline due to my schedule.

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Orlando,October 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  On a flight from Atlanta to Orlando on Oct 10 at 8pm, the plane boarded half an hour after the scheduled boarding time, with no update made to waiting passengers. I was refused to allow my check-in bag I paid for to be brought on the plane, though it fit in the overhead compartment, and I was verbatim told by another flight attendant there was ""plenty of room"" in the compartments after everyone had boarded. I had to take out my large iMac from my bag (forced to check the bag separately) and place my computer in the compartment with no protection. This is not a laptop - this is a large screen expensive desktop. The rude attendant who told me the bag is not coming on the flight even mentioned that she was chatting with another employee that they thought my bag was too big when we were waiting on board. Nothing was said to me during the extra ~30 min we were just sitting for the plane to open. I rode a Spirit flight earlier the same day, with the same exact baggage and had no problems. My four year old had to use the restroom after the plane had taxied to where we were going to take off (I had taken her immediately before boarding, but she is four... she had to go again.) As it looked like we would be sitting for a while and we were seated at the back of the plane, I asked an attendant if my daughter could use the bathroom. He audibly let out a frustrated sigh, agitatedly picked up the phone and exclaimed ""We're going to have to stop the plane!"" I waved him off, and told him she would wait, in order to avoid holding the plane. My four year old is now crying in the seat, doing everything she could to not wet her pants. Everyone around us could hear how upset she was. The plane continued to sit in the same place long enough that she could have gone to the bathroom at least 3 times. It literally would not have taken that long at all, she is 4 years old, there was absolutely no compassion from this attendant, and I was met with irritation, when I was already in an unfortunate situation I had no control over. I will never fly Frontier again. Every single person I encountered on this flight that worked for Frontier was rude and had no concept of customer service. "

A terrible attitude by flight attendants and agents and terrible seats! Upon booking the flight, we were told to arrive 3 hours prior to boarding. However, upon arrival, their ticketing desk didn't open until only 2 hours prior. Of course, their bargain-basement concourse had no food/services or available outside the security checkpoints, and no way to check baggage until their window opened. By the time they opened the ticketing 10 mins later than posted and we checked our baggage and waited in the security line, we were running with our 6 year old to make the gate on time. When I mentioned this to the surly attendant scowling at us for ""pushing our luck"" I was simply told ""to get it together."" Absolutely outrageous and unprofessional. To make things worse, the only non-stop flight available was an overnight/red eye, and we were more than dismayed to learn upon boarding that none of the seats reclined, unless you had paid additional in advance for the ""Stretch Seating"" option This should have been made more clear at the point of purchase (on their website.) This was the most uncomfortable flight my family of three has ever endured (and we like to travel.)  Even worse, while we were in FL visiting the inlaws, our home neighborhood in Santa Rosa was evacuated due to wildfires. We attempted to alter our return date, since we had only a damaged house to return to and very unhealthy air quality. I would have preferred my daughter and wife to remain in FL with her parents while I went home to deal with our losses. Frontier was incredibly unsympathetic and unwilling to suspend any of their extravagant fees for altering our flight. A doctor's note for a simple illness would suffice, but a national disaster area does not. Heartless unyielding policies are exactly what brings public animosity upon these mega corps. I can understand paying differences in fares, but profiting off a natural disaster by charging ""change fees"" is absolutely heartless and cruel. In the end, it will be cheaper to keep our flights as scheduled, put my family in a motel room and purchase respiration filters to deal with the poor air, rather than remain safely with the inlaws for a few extra days. I can't wait to give their representative a piece of my mind at the counter tomorrow when we get there."

Once I got to the airport they told me that I had missed my flight, that it was at 6.30 am. Turns out they rescheduled my flight for an early flight and said they could do nothing about it. I was in town for 2 days at a wedding I wasn't checking my email constantly. When I've had changes with other airlines they send me notification texts. Its not like Frontier didn't have my cell number. A 10 hour flight change is not a little inconvenience, its missing a whole day. And here I thought Spirit Airlines was the worst, well Frontier just took that seat. I will pay the extra money I have to pay for another airline and never fly Frontier again. I ended up paying for two one way tickets anyway, so in order to avoid another headache and hours at the airport, I will gladly take my business elsewhere."

Most were negative. I decided to book anyway and I am glad I did. Our flight was not only on time but early arriving in Nashville. The check in was easy and everyone was friendly. Because I had researched I knew I needed to buy my seat, pay ahead for checked bags and bring my own snacks. Because of the great experience and the low prices I will be flying with Frontier again."

I normally never have a problem with flying Frontier but for this flight they changed the departure and return time by over 2 hours. We were supposed to leave Friday night at 6pm and they changed the flight to 8.30pm. The flight was late by an hour to boot. There was never any explanation or ""sorry for any inconvenience"". All employees acted as if this was completely normal. I was not impressed and will do my best not to deal with Frontier in the future."

I missed my flight on September 30 and was rebooked for the 2 October. My past experience with flying haven't always been great, but this one was amazing. Yes my flight was delayed a few times due to the massacre there but we were giving food vouchers twice, we were in the safest place in the city and keep informed. The crew both ways were wonderful and the pilots were amazing. Just wanted to say thank you for making my trip a good experience."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Cincinnati,September 2017,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Minneapolis to Cincinnati. I purchased a ticket for my father, a disabled veteran and the baggage scales admin at Minneapolis told my father his bag weighed too much and made him pay $20 cash. She was extremely rude to him and also didn't attach any baggage ticket to his suitcase right in front of him. His bag was lost for two days after landing in CVG so he had no clothes and no money when he arrived. All my dad had was his very small backpack, which under Frontier's website says is free and they refuse to refund us for the entire cost of the luggage and carryon, which wasn't used. They claim they have no record of my father being charged $20 for his ""overweight"" bag. I was told via email that we would receive a $25 dollar refund and a $100 voucher to fly again.  We will definitely use Southwest or Delta instead on any future trips. Nobody should be treated the way that my father was. He was taken advantage of and Frontier isn't holding themselves accountable for their employees. Shame, because if their customer service was better and they weeded out these bad employees they could actually be a great airline."

The check in at airport was quick and easy. However $45 per bag is ridiculous. Flew in on another airline and it was only $25 A bag. No free beverage or snack as on all other flights I have ever taken. Plus endless announcements and even marketing campaign for their credit cards over PA system. I just wanted to read and relax not have live commercials assaulting me. Then the longest wait on baggage ever. After walking to baggage area. Walk included restroom stop which had a line. We waited at the carousel for 28 minutes before bags even began to surface for anyone. People were annoyed. Ridiculous to take that long. Won't fly Frontier again.

Wonder what time they'll choose next and I wonder if we'll even make it to Colorado. Oh yeah and there have been no apologies. Just rudely distributed $10.00 meal vouchers.

I paid for the seat and the carry on bag. I ended up with a tiny tray that I couldn't work on. When I moved up one row to get a full sized tray, they charged me $50 right there on the plane. It was embarrassing. I will never use this airline again, especially for business travel. Pay more, take a layover, do anything to avoid this airline."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Denver,September 2017,1.0,2.0,,,,3.0,1,no,2,"  Milwaukee to Denver. The $120 round trip tickets seemed like a great deal which is the only reason I booked. But as date of flight came and I had to finalize plans, I was disappointed to find that you had to then pay additional $ to choose a seat and pay for carry-on and checked luggage. (Separate charges for departing and returning flight). It was $38 for each carry-on and checked item if you paid online, $60 a piece if you paid at check-in at the airport. So flights that I purchased as a gift to my fiance because I thought I could afford $248 ended up costing me more like $450. The seats were very uncomfortable with minimal arm space and cramped leg space. If you wanted a soda or snack - you had to pay for those items seperately as well. On the way back, they called to start boarding but didn't actually start boarding, but left us in the walkway. Just standing there for 10 minutes without one person from the airline explaining what was going on. I paid extra for my seats on the flight home just to get extra leg room, $25 a seat. There really was little difference between that seat and the one I flew out on. The air blowing out from my vent above smelled like the sewage from the bathroom. All in all, disappointed in the overall experience and probably won't fly Frontier again."

Please spend the extra money not to ride. A slow crew of unprofessional people. They turned the computers on the airplane on and off two times. Sat in darkness with no AC for 15 min. Now waiting 20 or more mins for paperwork to clear them of their bad customer service. Will never fly Frontier again.
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Portland via Denver,September 2017,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Philadelphia to Portland via Denver. My wife and son had the pleasure of flying back Frontier, I hadn't planned on coming back although I did originally purchase a roudtrip ticket that i canceled and they wanted me to pay for a new ticket when i wanted to add the return back onto it.  First of all we were emailed 3 or 4 times prior to actually taking the flight that our flight times and dates were changed, we ended up losing over an entire day from our planned vacation. They offered us 50$ vouchers that could be used only (towards purchase of a future ticket in the same persons name) that had no cash value, and had to be redeemed within 90 days, so basically they were useless. We also had to pay extra money for checked bags and were not offered free carryons which was aggravating. They claim you can purchase the works for an extra 99$ per person, per way, which would have been like an extra 600$ for us. However it would have allowed us to get all baggage included and cover any elective changes to our itinerary - in hind sight it might have been better to bite the bullet - heres why : we paid over 100$ for baggage, then when we wanted to changed the name of the 3rd passanger they kept changing the price on us which went up every time we called. By the time we had decided to change the name they demanded we pay a 99$ itinerary change fee a 75$ name change fee, and the difference in price of ticket from original purchase to name change +$598. We were tried making changes online and the website was all buggy, declined our cards several times for no reason - it said we'd paid out over $5,000 for our tickets and would make the same addition multiple times or simply freeze on us. Customer service was terrible even after we obtained guarentee of price hold. I am 6'1"" and my knees had room, backs of the seats were gutted and totally solid -  didnt have enough room to bend over and lay on the tray table. We were also forced to layover in Denver for 6 hours turning what should have been a short trip into an all day fiasco. Service was subpar, they offered nothing free except water and their was no option for wifi at all. There were meetings in the back between passengers and crew for one of the entire flights. Denver airport was excellent and being an Oregon native Id say it is better than PDX even though PDX was rated top airport in the US."

Needless to say, I did not fly there on that day, although the flight was not cancelled? Why would anyone fly to the area, when authorities were telling folks to leave. My flight home was cancelled. I was given a refund for the return flight, but not for the flight to Ft. Lauderdale. I am extremely disappointed, even though it isn't a whole lot of money.  I will be flying to Lauderdale again soon, and will think twice about my carrier."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Detroit,September 2017,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Phoenix to Detroit. I have no word to describe how bad I feel about this company. Terrible service and no focus on customer.  The first time I flew with the was bad as well but I wrongly decided to give them another chance. My flight depart time was 6:25am. I got some traffic on the way to the airport and arrived at 5:50 to check a bag. I was informed that I could not because it would not make through TSA. I asked the lady what if I leave the bag (one of my friend was still around to keep it). The lady told me that I woul not make it through TSA and that the airplane would not wait for me (does it look like they double sold my seat?) Well, I decided to give a try. I open my backpack and got in the real essencial things from my to be checked bag, run run...by the way, I had my wife and son with me. We went through TSA in 5 min ran to the gate, got there at 6:14.  The airplane was there but the Door was closed. I knock the door and no answer. Not a single Frontier employee around.  Any other company would have somebody to help customers and let them in, even if it was 1 minute to depart. When I called the customer service they offered me another flight at 4:30pm but I would have to pay 99 dollars for each of us. I agree I was late for checking a bag, but I was at the gate on time to get in the plane. They do not refund the flight coming back, they give you credits to use in the next 3 months. As I do not plan to fly frontier ever again, it means I lost all my money and got nothing back in exchange, except trouble."

However, it got me from Atlanta to Phoenix relatively comfortably, safely and inexpensively. The crew were courteous enough but did seem focused on selling something. Whether it be drinks, snacks or credit cards they were determined to make the extra dime. My backpack worked fine, I drank a cup of free water and got the aisles seat I wanted so I didn't spend an extra dime. Both flights were early and I arrived impressed and pleased with all the money I saved. Not a single issue to complain about! "

They charged me for a carry-on bag that was smaller than most purses. The flight home was an absolute disaster, Frontier was the only airline to cancel flights that night. The manager over the phone gave me a free hotel but the lady behind the counter refuse to honor it.  And instead of resolving the issue, she continued to say no. After we slept in the airport, we finally got up the next morning and headed to our gate. Of course, everybody in the airport was apparently confused as to whether that would be at one gate or completely on the other side of the airport. I had to go through security three different times because we were mislead on which gate it would be at.  After we made it home I realize that the airline broke my stroller. So I went to the lady that handles the disputes and she said that she could not do anything about it because I signed some slip saying they were not liable. Come to find out the lady behind the desk that checked my bags to begin with was the lady who initialed the slip. "

This is the worst airline I have flown on in my 32 years of heavy traveling. The flight from DC to Austin was 4.5 hours delayed. I arrive to the airport and am informed by the most unprofessional, incompetent representative that my bag, which I've carried on literally every other airline costs $45. Then I was told that I could carry it on, but that would still cost $45. After this shakedown, I fly on what feels like the Wild West with the turbulence and have to wait an additional hour at the gate before we get off the plane."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Des Moines via Denver,September 2017,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I selected Frontier because we've had a good experience with their customer service in the past. I have personally flown with them more times than I can count. They were by far not the most affordable flight I could have chosen, but I thought their customer service more than made up for it and happily paid extra for the tickets. On our first flight, they insisted on gate-checking our carry-on bags that would have easily fit in the overhead compartment. No big deal, we'd grab them planeside, as we were told upon boarding. After we landed, we waited planeside for our bags, even asking a flight attendant about them. He assured us they would be dropped planeside. Another ten minutes, and we asked another flight attendant, who informed us they would have been sent to baggage claim. This made little sense, considering we had a connecting flight to catch and this would send us out of security. The attendant who checked our luggage had apparently marked our final destination as Denver, not even bothering to ask if that was our final stop. We had to go out of security, collect our baggage, and then go through security again, where we were nitpicked by the TSA for things the TSA in Los Angeles hadn't even batted an eye at. 40 minutes and relieved of some slightly-above 3.5 ounce toiletries later, we re-entered past security.(By the way, the Denver TSA will paw through your luggage for 15+ minutes over a bottle of foot powder.) We were fortunate our layover was lengthy, or we'd have ended up missing our connecting flight. As we boarded the next flight, I walked by without the attendant even looking at my bag. However, she then stopped my husband and insisted his bag was too large to fit in the overhead, despite it being the exact same size as mine. She refused to let him on the plane unless he paid $45 for carry-on. When he said our last flight had done no such thing and that his wife's bag was the same size as his, the attendant smugly replied she could always call me back and charge me $45 for my bag, as well. What on Earth? As I waited on my husband in my seat, concerned, the attendants went by, trying to make a list of seats still available, I assume for people on standby. I had to inform them the seat had been purchased by my husband, who was currently being held at the gate unless he forked over $45 some woman randomly decided to charge him because she could ""tell by looking"" his bag simply wouldn't fit. They didn't seem the least bit concerned. Not that I'd expect them to be, at this point. Finally, $45 later and with minutes until the plane closed, my husband enters, with his bag in tow. It easily fits in the overhead without any struggle. We spent $45 for a bag that most certainly fit. An absolute rip-off. Our flights departed and landed on time, but the poor service we received soured it. Way to go, Frontier. Your rinky-dink airline just lost two faithful customers. I've already told this story to three of my friends and intend to tell everyone else when they ask how our trip was. Answer being, absolutely awesome until Frontier was utterly incompetent. They should leave air travel to the better-equipped and trained airlines. I'll be sticking with Delta from now on. Wish I could give less than one for a rating."

We had originally had airlines to leave on Saturday the 9th. Frontier sent us an email offering a flight out on 9/7 at 7am. We went ahead and booked that as well. They offered these flights at $29 dollars. Very affordable and not gouging like other airlines at this time. Words cannot convey how blessed we are to have received this offer from Frontier. We called in and not only did they change our flight but credited back money from the flight on Saturday. They got us out and also took people on stand by. They waited to get as many people out as possible. The pilot, and flight attendants were all helpful and caring. The pilot said the crew was out of Maui and what an amazing crew!! We have flown with Frontier several times before and have never had any issues at those times . Only good things to say about them. Thank you Frontier for what you offered and got us out of Orlando in time. If we wouldn't have had the other offer Frontier gave to us and changed ticket dates we would of been stuck as they are closing the airport. We give Frontier a thumbs up and will use them often for other travel destinations. Thank you Frontier for helping us and making a way out. "

✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Missoula to Denver,August 2017,1.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8," I have flown with Frontier Airlines for about 7 year so now. For the first few years I really disliked their customer service and everything else about them. Their cheap flights surely reflected in their services. However over the years I've grown to understand that if you are smart and take your time and understanding Frontier and how they operate, then your flight won't cost any more than the price reflected after taxes and fees. You don't have to pay for a seat. You don't have to pay for a personal item like a backpack or small item, that is smaller than a traditional carry on. Those are optional. Many people see the seat selection and bag selection and believe it's mandatory, but it isn't. Just press continue and you'll have your seat selected for you. As long as you are at the airport and are at the counter to check any baggage within 45 minutes of your flight, then you can check in and check your bag. Any sooner past 45 minutes til your flight, even at 44 minutes? And you will not be able to check you bag or check in. In all reality Frontier leaves your success up to you. They are an amazing airline as far as cost goes and they have many options that allow you to customize your experience. Anyone with any other opinion? isn't doing it right. I fly with Frontier now at least 3 times a month. And I wouldn't change it for anything. Because if I did? I couldn't afford to even fly 1 time a month, let alone 3."

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Providence,August 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  We were so excited to see Frontier come to TF Green, allowing another reasonable option for flights. However, when we assumed reasonable, we were wrong. If you buy the ticket and are unprepared for all of the additional nickle and diming that happens you will be shocked! They punish families with additional seating fees at check in. Clearly my 8 year old can't be scattered from her family during the flight. So I pay an additional $20+ per person to get our seats together. Drinks? Nope, an egregious fee for that too. As well as checked and/or carry on luggage. I could have easily flown comfortably with a movie and great customer service on JetBlue (with a better flight time) for the same amount. Also as far as Customer Service, Frontiers attendants may want to consider not screaming at each other in the back of the plane may cause some panic and discomfort among passengers. Especially since it was over a coffee pot. That same attendant may consider another round of training as she yelled at my husband to ""not touch my things, do you hear me?"" as he attempted to move her bag (he didn't know it was an attendants) so he could fit his in the overhead. Or telling passengers, even though there were empty seats throughout the plane, that they must stay in their assigned seats due to load balancing concerns (you didn't ask my weight, not my luggages weight when I bought the seat? I'm assuming this is so people don't move to premium they didn't pay through the nose for instead?). We will absolutely fly other airlines."

This airline may be inexpensive to start but once you make even the smallest mistake in your booking you will find the charges just keep compiling. We were new to this airline and decided to give them a try, first of all the website is confusing and once you start booking the flight if you are not paying close attention you will leave off anyone you are booking with. When we called to try and fix the issue they just said they would cancel the flight for $25 and then we can re-book at a much higher rate. Or we can just book my flight separate from my companion. We opted for the latter to avoid the huge cost change and then try and change at the service counter. Instead of getting a happy ending we got nope the flight your companion is on is booked, you can fly in later which was 7 hours later. When my companion got on his flight there were 8 seats still open including one next to him. I don't think i will be using this company again. My flight was empty but i was still forced to sit in my assigned seat and the seats are hard, the people are emotionless."

Upon arrival to my destination I found out my bag had not made it. My bag was the only bag that didn't arrive and it's now been 24 hours and I still don't have my bag.

We get there and the customer service was rude, they had no empathy that their airline messed up our whole trip. The next time to fly to Vegas was 24 hours later.

We were delayed for close to three hours (due to ""mechanical issues""), and Frontier always hesitated to make an announcement until 30 minutes prior to the departure time, which kept getting pushed back. Sometimes they said nothing at all and just quietly changed the departure time on the digital display. When I finally got on the plane, the flight attendants were rude. A young lady tried to use an outlet to charge her phone, and the flight attendant insisted that she not use it, explaining that ""well we have ashtrays in the restrooms but you can't use those."" To top it off the tray tables were the size of an envelope, literally. I placed an envelope on the table and it covered the entire thing."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Cleveland,August 2017,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I recently flew a non-stop flight from Cleveland to San Diego to pick up my children after their summer break and back to Cleveland from San Diego. After all the bad reviews I was expecting the worst, after all I purchased the tickets for 50% off. I was incredibly impressed! The night before, I had to call Frontier to find out about my children receiving an escort to get them through security and meet me on the other side, their customer service was so helpful and patient giving me info about how to obtain a gate pass. I felt well informed of their carry on policy and that only a personal item was included but just to make sure at the gate, I asked. She gladly stepped out to take a look for me. I was expecting an old beat up plane that I'd have to be saying prayers the entire way that I'd make it there safely but instead I walked onto a very clean, new plane. The seats did not recline, but were comfortable enough to take a few naps. The plane wasn't too crowded, so staff informed us that we can change seats after take off. They do charge for snacks and drinks, but I packed some snacks for my kids for the flight home and they didn't have one complaint. Overall, I would definitely recommend, their staff are wonderful and seeing how I paid just about $300 for 4 tickets to fly across the country, you really can't beat that. "
✅ Verified Review ,A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Austin,August 2017,4.0,3.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," My Frontier flight from Philadelphia to Austin was delayed going out and then delayed again on way home. The issue I have is the utter lack of communication by the staff. Our plane has mechanical issues and they made zero announcements. People went to gate agent and they answered questions but didn't communicate to the larger group. Our plane was delayed nearly five hours with no effort made to try to get us on other flights. This airline is the very definition of ""no frills"". Be prepared."

Arrived in Denver from Indianapolis and instead of a 3 hour layover, had 5 hours. Now, I am trying to return home and will be at Denver airport for an 8 hour delay. This is ridiculous. I do not know if this is staffing issues or what, but people have jobs and lives and this should not be a frequent occurrance to be delayed. I will never book through Frontier Airlines again."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Columbus ,August 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Frontier Airlines is without a doubt the most embarrassing excuse for an airline I have ever seen. Our flight time from Las Vegas to Columbus was pushed back two and a half hours in total. Along with this, they offered next to no consolation because of our wait. Flight attendants were kind and attentive as one would hope. However, I will continue to believe Frontier Airlines is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. I will never be giving them my business again."
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati,August 2017,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  As a first time flyer I must say I was happy with my experience flying from Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Turbulence was little rough at times even at 36,000 feet but not the airlines fault. Flight arrived 25 minutes early at our destination. Crew were friendly and professional. Pilot greeted us as we boarded and was friendly. I would recommend Frontier to my friends and family and plan on using them again. Only thing I would add is personally I would have liked to hear the captain announce when we cross over state lines if possible. Not sure if that is something that is done on other flights or maybe I'm the only person who would care to know such things. Overall great experience for me as a first timer."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Cincinnati,August 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Frontier Airlines was terrible from the extremely late start to our flight from Las Vegas to Cincinnati, to the extended wait for baggage at the end. We waited for an almost 2 hour delay just to sit for another hour on the tarmac. Then do it again upon landing. Then wait another 45 minutes for bags to arrive. They book too many flights with not enough planes, staff, or airport property. They essentially share everything and can't run the business. What was supposed to an easy 3.5 hour flight home took 6 hours. The flight before ours to Columbus got delayed from 4 pm to 8 pm then cancellled. Left tons of people stranded late at night after waiting for hours. Never ever again will I use this airline. Need to say this also. Their ""cheap"" flights end up costing more than everyone else. You have to pay for seats, baggage, carry on baggage, and a lot of other tiny additions. When I went online to confirm my information I accidentally backspaces over an ""e"" in my middle name and they charged my account 168.00 for ""changing my information"". They reluctantly put it back on my card but of course it takes 5-7 business days so I got to head out to vacation 168.00 less than expected. Such a joke of an ""airline""."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to St. Louis,August 2017,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I travel very frequently and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had flying from Las Vegas to St. Louis. Everything beginning with getting my boarding pass and paying for my carry-on has been awful. The attendants are extremely rude, unprofessional, and poorly trained. A passenger vomited prior to take off and the rest of us were expected to travel uncomfortably rather than the airline just doing a courtesy to the sick individual. The flight attendant who spoke to me was very rude and nasty in the way she handled the situation. I am extremely displeased. I will not be flying Frontier ever again and I do not recommend it to anyone else. After all the extra fees and inconveniences, I could pay the same price to travel a much better airline."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Pheonix to Orlando,September 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  About 1 week to departure we got a wonderful email informing us our return flight went from a hour and a half layover to a 8 hour layover. When we called to ask why it was changed they could give us no answers and just gave us a 50$ voucher. So, you're going to give me a 50$ voucher for an 8 hour layover which I'd now need to get a hotel since we took red eyes in hopes of saving money. So now I was down 100$ for a hotel nearby without getting a taxi. That's just where it began to be fun. Our first flight was flying from PHX to DEN, take in mind we paid for better seating and upgraded our seats for more leg room. Upon entering the plane all of the seats were the same size and it was uncomfortably cramped (Arm rests didn't move). When I asked the flight attendant why our upgraded seats were not upgraded I was told that is because the plane ""we chose"" didn't offer it and then ignored me completely for the rest of the flight not offering me anything when walking by even while I continuously said mam. So we had a layover in DEN for an hour and a half, by the time I got on the next plane I was already a little upset with my service. So, next plane comes and we board. The seats were slightly larger towards the front but none of the arm rests went up. Who thought that was a good idea? Let's give economy moveable arm rests but upgraded seating to slightly larger, more cramped seating? During this flight I asked why the arm rests didn't go up and was completely ignored, so I dropped it, I then asked for a drink yet again on this flight. Three times I asked, the lady continued to stare at me while I stared back until 3 and a half hours went by and she had the courage to ask me ""Would you like a soda?"" at this point I was annoyed and responded by ""yes, I asked 3 times"" and she just responded with ""No need to yell sir"". Then asked me again ""So you're sure you'd like a drink?"". I was just shocked, we were landing in 15 minutes and I just decided to move on and forget it. So our returning flights a week later went exactly how I suspected. It was ORL to DEN then to PHX. On our way to DEN we were consistently bugged by our flight attendant to move for this couple that had ""air sickness"" after waiting over 30 minutes for them to stop essentially blackmailing me I said alright move. So I moved to a non-premium seat so this couple could sit in our seats. The flight went on and they proceeded to watch movies, laugh and disturb everyone around them. Seems our seats cured their ""air sickness"". Not to mention I barely fit in their seats (6""10, 350 lbs). On our last flight to PHX I finally caught a break with the terrible service and finally got a beverage and some answers to why our flights had been so poor. They told me it was because they were receiving new planes. Then continued to talk about their credit card for the next 45 minutes of the flight while handing brochures to everyone including me which I made clear I did not want and never will want. So when I got back home I decided to call Frontier up because I was absolutely shocked by their service. I was told to calm down and that I needed proof and that all of their planes had premium seating and lifting arm rests and was completely disrespected and was told deal with it or pay the difference, 900$ more."

Our flight was delayed in Cancun for almost 2 hours. Hard plastic seats. No beverages or snacks. Unfriendly staff. They claim there was a dent in the plane and they had to wait for confirmation to fly. We missed our connecting flight in Denver. There was no pre-arrangements made for any of the passengers with connecting flights. It was ""we got you part way there, figure out how to get home on your own"". No apologies and the most horrendous customer service. Not a single employee was helpful. You literally have to get loud and obnoxious for them to take you seriously. I ended up booking a return flight with Delta for another $400 or else I would have been at the Denver airport for 2 days. This is not an airline. This is like a bad infomercial.

Stewardesses from another Fromtier flight were being very rude to customers.

Finally I had to call the frontier customer service and I said what is the flights status. She said, it is delayed and departing at 9:05 pm. I finally asked at the gate from the Frontier Airlines staff how am I going to manage all this, staff said, you get nothing because the problem with the flight is due to bad weather. I showed her the weather radar map that shows no weather problem and the United and Southwest flights flew in the same region Indianapolis, Chicago, Cleveland."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Seattle ,August 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,3,"  Phoenix to Seattle . Unless you're flying with no luggage, it's not worth it. You pay the same price with all of the add ons. Luggage is extra, carry ons are extra, picking your seat is extra, snacks, water, even sitting in the emergency exit. And on a half empty flight, they still enforce the seating. Unfortunately, our stewardess was pretty rude, although that's probably not the case across the board. The flight happened to be on time though."

Currently sitting on the tarmac for two hours in San Francisco for my flight to Orlando because of a broken luggage scanner. Instead of moving plane and allowing us to get off they make us wait 2 hours while they fix a baggage scanner and then load all of the luggage onto another plane. No leg room, pay for sodas, cramped, seats don't recline, no in-flight entertainment, $35 dollars just for a carry on? Come on Frontier, this is the best you can do? Lame."

I prearranged for wheel chair assistance. When I arrived at the airport at midnight there was no wheelchair, no Frontier employee. The gate was empty. Luckily some friends I made on the plane helped me. It is impossible to contact a real person at Frontier for any reason. A generic recording tells you to call back later! What good company does that? They overbook every flight which causes delays while they shuffle passengers around. Never fly Frontier Airlines."

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Cleveland, Ohio to Orlando, Florida",July 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was my first time flying with Frontier from Cleveland, Ohio to Orlando, Florida and it will definitely be my last. I was charged for a carry on bag which fit the dimensions of being placed under my seat which really was an inconvenience. Also our flight was delayed with no notice at all, boarding doors were switched at the last minute. This was possibly the worst flight I have ever taken with possibly the worst airline I have ever flown with. "
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Raleigh Durham,July 2017,4.0,5.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  I had a simple non-stop flight from Orlando to Raleigh Durham. Knowing the baggage fees, I only took a backpack which fit under the seat in front of me. The only issue with the flight was about a 45 minute delay which was not clearly explained. From my observation it seemed to be first of all some delay in loading checked luggage and then also some issues with passengers who had carry on luggage and were not clear on the policy. Whether that was their own fault or a travel agents, I do not know. I feel as though you should be well informed of what you're signing up for on these budget airlines and if you plan accordingly you'll have no problems. The flight itself was ~85 minutes and there were no problems after take off. Very professional flight staff. Being such a short flight I had no need for food/beverage service or wifi. A round trip flight on this route with any of the primary carriers would cost twice as much and probably have a layover - I would opt for Frontier 10 times out of 10. With that said - if you have any carry on or checked luggage, taking a 2 hour + flight or have multiple connectors I can see how the problems could quickly arise and add up. If you have a trip that will fulfill any of those options, might want to go with a primary carrier."

Their body language spoke for the type of service we got! They charge 60 bucks for a checked bag or even a carry on. As the plane is taxing to take off, the pilot pulls over turns the engines off and says he has to reroute the plane and we sit for an hour. On the way back, we got the same terrible service, very unfriendly, and the plane was delayed 2 hours. I ask the ticket agent why it was late, she said she didn't know."

When I talked to the attendant about the new updated departure time she said they automatically provide a new time without any real information. We are still waiting and keep getting misinformation. At this point, I'm just hoping I get to Vegas tonight. Never again on this airlines. I don't care how much money I can save. Not worth the aggravation."

Two months ago I booked a round trip on Expedia heading out on Virgin America and returning on Frontier. I reserved window seats on both airlines’ websites. Just before my trip, I discovered Frontier had moved me to a middle seat. They wouldn’t let me move to the window or aisle without charging me. Their seat reservation was a lie. I was shocked that Frontier made me pay an extra $35 to carry on a small soft bag. (Virgin charged nothing.) Want a coffee a Sprite on a Frontier flight? You have to pay extra for anything besides water. (Soft drinks were free on Virgin.) Frontier’s avaricious surcharges destroyed the economy of the trip I specifically booked for price. There’s a reason this airline is always at the bottom of the customer ratings (which I didn’t know when I booked)."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Charlotte,July 2017,1.0,3.0,,,,2.0,1,no,2,"  Orlando to Charlotte. No one at check in desk in Charlotte when there was a very long line. They comvince you the prices are low and then charge the same amount as the flight or more to have luggage -- even carry ons! And then to get a specific seat assignment, they charge more. The flight to leave Charlotte was delayed because of storms (a fair reason) but no explanation was given for the two hour delay on the return flight, which we were only informed about when we were in line to check in for the flight from orlando. It appeared that our plane first thing in the AM, was coming from California. No food or drink is served without charge in the plane. Seats are harder than usual. Tray tables are teeny (not really a problem without food, I suppose.) No plane wifi. If they are going to present this as a discount flight, they need to charge an actual discount price. I could've paid the same to Southwest and carried more luggage and been much happier, and maybe one of my flights might have been on time. I will say the cabin staff was kind of great. Less formal and more likely to joke around and be pleasant in an honest way."

I often fly Frontier (4-6 times per year) and while there are negative reviews I have always appreciated this airline. I always pay extra for the ""works"" mostly to get the refundability on the tickets. I also have their credit card and use it often. Today's flight was a bit marred by one flight attendant. I was traveling with my 16 year old son, and my 5 year old daughter. Our first encounter with this attendant was asking my 16 year old, quite harshly to put his seatbelt on. He had it on but removed to assist his sister and forgot to re-clasp. Anyway, it was just her tone and demeanor. Next encounter was when my 5 year old had to use the restroom. We were in line when it was announced that we should sit and I was told to go sit down - again, tone and demeanor was not friendly, nor polite so I asked if we could quickly go in as an accident would be a mess and her response was, ""a broken arm would be worse"". Before my conversation or scolding from her she was talking to an attendant next to her and then went right back to it after her comment like we were just a nuisance and should shoo away. The comment wasn't even the problem as she had a point, however, it could have been delivered in a more polite and kind way. When we finally got into the restroom after minor turbulence I noticed that someone had a problem down the front of the toilet.. of course I noticed after the fact and was disgusted that my daughter probably brushed up against it. When I came out of the bathroom the rude attendant was right there and I showed it to her and asked if they had someone that could wipe it up. Her response,"" we don't have cleaning supplies"". Earlier I noticed some gunk on the window shade and notified another flight attendant that was happy to get me a warm and wet cloth and I wiped it up - very pleasant exchange as she was happy I wiped that up and I was happy it was clean. I still appreciate Frontier, however, I hope they check employees attitudes and approach to customers. All the other attendants were friendly, fun and helpful. We didn't need much help but the male attendant entertained my daughter and many other people I saw as well. The flight was relatively pleasant but she definitely made it less so!"

Almost a month after booking my flight I receive a email that my reservation has changed and my flight from a direct flight to one with a layover, and has been moved up 10 hours with no other option to change to that day. I would have to either move up my flight nearly a day or pos pone by a day. They are unable to compensate for the inconvenience and cost that I will incur for having to book another flight so last minute. I understand things change but I have never had a flight change 10 hours unless weather related. There was no explanation for this change besides flight paths have been adjusted. When trying to reach a customer service representative I waited on hold for 3 hours the first day and never got through, and 1 hour the next day to finally get ahold of someone who was simply reading a script and clicking prompts."

We had the hotel and car reserved, and we had to go back home and wait 24 hours to get their first available flight. All they said was ""Sorry for the inconvenience"". They don't clean the planes in between flights. My seat floor was covered in food.  You can't sit on the seats for more than an hour without having your legs or butt numb. No snacks. No wi-fi. There's no baggage included in the tickets so you end up paying up to $60 for each luggage less than 50 lbs. Sorry Frontier, I would gladly pay a little more for a more serious airline. I tried to save a little but ended up losing a lot of money with their service. I'll only give them 2 stars because the customer service and the airport employees were really nice and not rude at all even though they only apologised and couldn't do anything but give us some useless vouchers for food inside the airport and hotel in our hometown. Other than that, it was a horrible experience."

There was a flight for Philadelphia scheduled at 2:30pm behind ours and they planned to take our plane to the warehouse to fix it and give the Philadelphia passengers the new plane which is absolutely ridiculous considering we've been waiting longer.

Frontier cancelled my flight without any notification to me - no call, email, or update on their app. When I looked at my boarding pass and confirmation information on the app there was no update to the flight that said it had been cancelled. I drove 2 hours from Richmond, VA to Dulles in DC for my flight at 4:30am and went to the gate only to see that the flight was cancelled. I had to go back to the ticketing desk to talk to a servicing company (no one from the airline was there) and they said they could only refund my ticket or rebook me on a flight on Monday.  This is absolutely the worst I have ever been treated by an airline. I missed my nephew's first birthday party because of this horrible airline.  And to make matters worse, they make you wait 1+ hours to talk to anyone on the phone to get a refund and make you listen to advertisements about their airline while you wait. They will not refund you for the time or money spent to get to the airport only for your flight to be cancelled out of nowhere."

The people on the ground gave conflicting answers, the people at the help desk couldn't help. We were told we couldn't rebook on a different flight, and then overheard them doing exactly that for other people, but when we got back up to the desk, the alternate flight was full.

If you add up a carry-on and two checked luggages (which are in comparison included in all Southwest's fares for instance) and assuming you would pay online upon booking, then expect to pay an additional $105 this summer! and even more if you pay upon check-in and/or at the airport. Would still fly with them again if they offer the lowest fares considering all the services I need."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Portland via Denver,July 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Columbus to Portland via Denver. Terrible airline. After missing my flight due to car trouble they charged $100 to rebook, ok my fault I get it. After rebooking for the following day I arrived in Denver on time, they had rebooked me with a 9hr layover in Denver, however upon arrival I noticed they had another flight departing to Portland within 1 hour. I confirmed at the gate that the flight was not full and made my way to the service counter where they told me it would be another $100 to rebook again! Instead of simply putting me in an empty seat and potentially selling my seat on the later flight they wanted to charge another rebooking fee. I asked to speak to the superior who told me ""that's how it goes here"". I and many others will not fly with them again because of the service."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Philadelphia,July 2017,3.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Austin to Philadelphia. I was nervous about flying with Frontier after reading so many horrible reviews but was pleasantly surprised.  Frontier made it very clear to me on their website that they charge for bags, seats, and additional drinks. I made sure that even with all the additional charges, that my ticket would be cheaper than the other airlines. If you're going to be flying with additional family members, perhaps you should not fly with Frontier because of all the additional costs. The seats are going to be less comfy and no outlets or TVs on the aircraft. That's how Frontier keeps its tickets cheap. I flew direct from Austin to Philly and back with no delays or issues. The flight attendants and pilots were very accommodating.  I did not pay for comfortable seats or sodas to drink on the plane. I would definitely fly with Frontier again for the amazingly cheap prices and efficiency!"
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Seattle,July 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to Seattle. The biggest joke of an airline I have ever flown with. If your favorite thing is to get hit with fees at any moment, this is the airline for you! After purchasing our tickets through Expedia we were required to pay for our seats once we reached the ticket counter and were required to pay $45 to carry on one bag each. We had to pay to carry on a piece of luggage that fit the standard size and weight.Do not expect any complimentary drinks, these all start at $2.99. What was also interesting is that in the premium seating, ~$21 per seat, the chairs do not recline. I assume that they do not recline throughout the entire plane. "
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Diego,July 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  My return flight from Orlando to San Diego, originaly scheduled at 8.56 pm, was ""delayed"" already at 3.30pm by 3h 30min, i.e. for 12.30 am the next morning! At 10.30pm the plane was cancelled without any verbal announcement (my son noticed it on a display board). The airline offered no explanation for a reason of their decision. At the counter the rep offered either rebooking for the same flight 21 hours later or a full refund. Without any hesitation I chose the latter, considering four of us (2 children including) would have a slim chance getting on board of the plane most likely already fully booked. This airline seems to be a notorious abuser of timely flights, having hidden and excessive fees (a piece of luggage $70, carry on $35), and equipping its planes with most uncomfortable seats. Too much trouble with little savings to ever consider in the future for me. I will stay away from this carrier."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Atlanta,June 2017,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Arrived 3 hours late on my Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Atlanta on 22 June 2017. Flight attendants were very nice but the airline is pathetic. Had already purchased tickets for my wife and child for 27 June unfortunately. When picking them up in Denver, took hours after the flight arrived for 1 bag to come. They said they were understaffed. Why is that our fault? What did we pay an extra $45 for a checked bag for? Pathetic airline. Better to fly Southwest I expect. I'll be using other airlines for my business travel!"
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Houston to Denver,June 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  Houston to Denver. Coffee or even a cup of water is $3.00 a cup? Not good! I paid the additional $152.00 for premium boarding which covered my second checked in bag. It did cover it on the way over there but not on the way back. I paid $50.00 for the second bag on the return trip. What a violation of ethics and honesty as I see it. Luggage took 45 minutes to get to the carousel. I have flown over 100 flights in the past 12 years on other airlines and this never happened. I will not fly this airline again. 
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Cancun,June 2017,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Will never fly with Frontier again. While the fares might be low, they stick it to you with baggage fees. We had same amount of bags going to Cancun as we did flying back to the US but got charged different rates. On top of charging so much for baggage, they want to charge you for a drink and snack. I think that should be included when you purchase your ticket. Then, the seats are so uncomfortable and feel cramped up."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Diego,June 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Frontier cancelled my Orlando to San Diego flight after boarding while trying to get to the runway. The airport has a 11:30 pm to 6:30 am curfew not allowing any departure flights during this time. The flight was on schedule to depart at 10:57 pm. At 11:32 pm, the plane only made it to some part of the runway only to announce the flight was canceled due to curfew and only a $10 breakfast voucher with no accommodation or compensation were to be offered. The next available flight would be at 1:30 pm. Most of us had to spend the night at the airport. There was no available rooms in the city. Staff was rude, inhumane and arrogant. On top of all, I had to spend $80 extra to check in my one piece of luggage and one carry on. Seats are very uncomfortable with no amenities for 5 hour long flight. Have never experienced this type of service anyware. Never again will I fly Frontier."

Poor customer service, my flights have been delayed more than on time, over priced bag policy, and dirty planes complete this mess of an airline.

Our tickets ended up costing us more than the airline that we usually fly with. On the day of our departure, Check in went smoothly. Then the problems began . Our flight was delayed three times and our departure gate was changed three times also. All total our flight was delayed for eight hours. We had no problems with the Frontier staff. But we witnessed numerous customers being talked to in a rude manner. This was our first time and last time to ever fly with Frontier. This airline did not save us any money .Nor did it get us to our destination on time. For future flights."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,June 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," After spending an incredible amount of money to pay for bags, our flight was delayed four times! Our original Frontier flight time was departing at 3:00 pm and arriving in Denver at 5:00 pm. Our flight got delayed from 3:00 to 5:55 to 6:28 to 7:30. We had a 5.5 hour drive from Denver and the Frontier employees did not seem to want to help anyone and their needs. I understand delays happen, but that is not the passengers fault and when an airline does not show any concern, it is the ultimate turn off from an airline. I will never fly this airline again and I would advise everyone to do the same. Terrible airline, scam you out of every cent you have and then don't show a sheet of concern when things go wrong when it's their fault! Terrible experience"
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Cleveland,June 2017,1.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9," I was very reluctant to fly on Frontier due to so many horrible reviews. I had an emergency family situation and Frontier had a non-stop from Portland to Cleveland with the lowest fare I've ever found ($104 base price before bags), so I decided to take a chance on a 'no-frills' carrier. (My usual airline is Alaska). My flights to and from Portland were exactly on time, and boarding was very efficient. The Airbus plane was very clean, the flight attendants were excellent - good-humored, friendly, helpful with special requests, and genuine real people, culturally diverse. I was particularly impressed when the person in front of me asked a flight attendant how to get a job at Frontier and the attendant took a really long time with her, coming back as she had time to answer more questions. She was entirely positive and encouraging about the benefits of working for Frontier and went way beyond what I would have expected. She gave a great 'face' to Frontier. The flight itself was very smooth, but the captain was very cautious when there was a chance of turbulence to warn us, get people back to seats, and lift the seatbelt sign as soon as possible. In most cases, I could tell there was a change in altitude or speed and turbulence was avoided. (I'm a nervous flyer so I appreciate that.) There is not much available in the way of food and beverages, but it seems to me that the 'happy hour' alcohol promotion 2 for 1 deals were over-promoted, and I watched people around me drink way too much and get annoyingly loud. I've certainly seen that on other airlines, but I've never seen happy hour price promotion like this. The aircraft itself was very clean and the attendants came regularly to pick up trash and remind people to get it out of the seat pocket. As to value, I wonder if making bags always paid for whether carry on or checked makes sense, since everyone staying more than one day is likely to have a bag, so why not include it in the fare? But for business there-and-back travel this could be an excellent deal. My one and only negative is that the seat was way too hard. Nice, cleanable vinyl, but almost no padding. I had to keep standing up to relieve the discomfort. I did see another flyer had brought his own inflatable seat cushion, so I might try that next time. For the price I paid, this was an excellent experience and I will absolutely attempt to find Frontier flights when my routes allow it. Glad I took the chance."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Orlando,June 2017,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Was set to fly out at 5:54pm from Milwaukee to Orlando and flight got delayed 3 hours. By the time we actually took off it was 3.5hrs. Never told why the flight was delayed but airport said we had to be on time for original flight in case, so we sat there for 5 hours. Frontier sent a voucher for next time which was nice but come Tuesday when we went to fly again to come back home flight was delayed 2 hours. Asked why it was delayed and they would not say. Every other flight at the airport was still taking off on time. Got on the plane and sat another 30+mins until it finally took off. Looking back now the $50 voucher we got is not worth it at all. I will never fly with Frontier again."
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Denver,June 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flew from Cincinnati to Denver. Worst airline in the business. Always delayed, sitting in the plane as I write this because the gate wasn't ready, its been 30 minutes since we landed. The seats are cramped, I'm 6'4"" and I do not fit into the seat, no leg room. Tried to go to the back where there were open rows but was yelled at to sit back in my assigned seat, so the 4 rows set empty the entire flight. Not worth the cheap tickets. Would highly not recommend flying Frontier."
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Orlando,June 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, On my recent Frontier Airlines flight from Los Angeles back to Orlando the flight took off at 10 PM one hour into the flight it was announced we had to have to make an emergency landing in Phoenix and that they was going to dump all the fuel. As the plane came in to land the airport was littered with emergency vehicles. They then give us a $10 food voucher but nowhere was open in the airport to buy a drink or food at 3 AM. They finally found an old hotel and at 7AM we have to be back at the airport. I landed in Orlando at 5 PM - 11 hours late with no explanation of what I had happened and with a measly $200 compensation travel voucher. I lost a days pay at work which was far more than the $200 they gave me and an 11 hour delay treated like animals at the airport by there ground crew. I would never fly this airline again its the third time flying with them in the last year and all 3 delays. I can only say never again will I fly with Frontier Airlines - I would never recommend it to anybody
✅ Verified Review ,A319,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Raleigh/Durham,June 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,  Philadelphia to Raleigh/Durham. Don't fall for low fares of Frontier Airline. This is a trap. You end up paying many times more. The worst airline I ever flew in my entire life. Ground staff was rude. I paid $ 60 for a small carry on (roll on bag) while others were allowed much bigger duffel bags on their backs.
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Austin,January 2017,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Las Vegas to Austin. I had high hopes for this flight. Leaving Las Vegas I was able to check in and when I did online, it said that I would have to pay for my carry on online or it would be double at the airport. So $40 online and $80 at the airport. I paid online and got to the airport and the agent said that my bag could be a personal bag and I didn't have to pay, but they can't issue a refund. Then the flight was on time until 10 mins before boarding. Long story short, my flight was and hour late boarding and 30 minutes late getting to Austin. The flight attendant was speaking intangible on the intercom and didn't know where the flight was going all times she announced it over the intercom. To make the situation even worse, the lights completely turned off as we the passengers were exiting the airplane and it took the pilot 5 minutes to get them cackle on. Pay the extra money and get better service and communication. I was really disappointed."
✅ Verified Review ,,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Cincinnati,June 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  I've flown Frontier a handful of times and have yet to be impressed. Today, was the piece de la resistance. I am writing this, while waiting for my baggage having flown from San Diego to Cincinnati. Because I have the time. I've had baggage delays at busy airports, not at airports that are empty, nor have I had them at airports where there is no other baggage to be loaded and sent to the claim. Yet here I stand, after having landed at the airport over an hour ago now, and having been waiting at baggage claim for an hour, to find out. They still have not dropped the baggage."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Cincinnati via Denver,June 2017,1.0,3.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Seattle to Cincinnati via Denver. My first flight was delayed over an hour with no explanation and when we finally arrived in Denver, it took an hour for us to get let off the plane. The flight attendants, however, were really accommodating (offered me a better, open seat). Due to my flight path, I was left to sleep in the Denver airport all night (really uncomfortable, very little sleep). And finally when it was time to take my next flight, the gate changed within an hour of the flight departure and my back happened to be turned away from the gate (no announcement was made and I was already confused due to the time change) and I missed the flight I had slept on the ground all night for. Exasperated, I went to the service desk and the agent informed me that ""Frontier doesn't page for missing passengers."" And that it would be $99 to get the next flight out. The only saving grace were that my tears and genuinely exhausted appearance must have been enough for her to show some compassion and the fee was waived. If you're thinking about flying Frontier because ""it's cheaper"" don't. Spend a little more. Get an airline that actually cares if you're on your flight."

Our flight from Atlanta to Kansas was delayed. They gave us no updates as to where our plane was or when it was to be expected. They just laughed and joked around with their buddies about how ""Frontier is never delayed"". Obviously Frontier's staff do not have much respect for their company. Doesn't reflect well."

This ticket was $20 cheaper than Delta. Our mistake to choose this airline. For the price difference, Delta is worth it. It seems that they do not clean the airplane from previous flights.

It would be impossible for a flight that lands back on the ground to be any worse. Frontier consistently, trip after trip, does a terrible job. Horrible website. Nickel and dime you for everything. Rude under trained staff. Bad flight times. I honestly think that they hate their customers. It would be impossible for them to design a worse travel experience.

Just when you think you're getting a break on your ticket they charged me $40.00 to check one bag. Then they totally forget my row for drinks. We landed at 10.47 pm and didn't get to a gate until 11.15pn and now we are still waiting for bags to start coming around the carousel and it is 12.05 am.

❎ Unverified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sioux Falls to Denver,May 2017,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Sioux Falls to Denver. We had a 4 hour delay in SIoux Falls, SD which we could live with, but once boarded there were more computer issues and we sat there for another hour. On arrival in Denver we had another hour delay prior to getting off the airplane and another hour waiting for our checked bags. Due to these delays we were unable to pick up our rental car and had to find another one in the middle of the night in freezing rain and then drive 70 miles to our destination through a snow storm. If we wouldn't have been delayed it wouldn't have cost us $250 more for a car and $75 more for a shuttle for family that was meeting us. They sent us a lousy $50 voucher to use in the next six months which does us no good and I will not fly frontier again if I can help it. I sent a complaint to Frontier on their website and the CSR answered me with a ""sorry for the inconvenience"" and stated an entirely different flight and situation. I answered back with ""you could at least get that right""! Very dissatisfied with Frontier and I feel sorry for the airline employees."

Before flying Frontier Airlines, I was an exclusive Delta customer. I decided to try Frontier after seeing the outrageously overpriced of tickets from the Midwest (IND) to the Northwest (PDX or Seattle.) Now, after flying both airlines, I can say that there is little difference between my experiences with Frontier and Delta. There are a few differences which include more comfortable seats, a free carry-on bag and free snacks and beverages on Delta, but that is about it. It is so worth it to pack a backpack (as my ""free personal item"" for Frontier) and to buy snacks and a drink at the airport because I saved over $300 on my ticket!"

Long story short, Frontier used to be great, they were bought out, and now they are horrible. My last experience from NYC to Denver left me with a 3 taxi rides to and from the airport which far exceeded the price of my airline ticket. I will never buy a ticket from Frontier again just because they have cheeper prices. This was not my first bad experience with them as well."

I recommend flying with an airline that while more expensive treats you like you matter. I would not fly Frontier again even if it was free.

Second, I was late for work because of the 1.30 hour delayed on the plane after boarding, and they don't do anything about it such as giving us a complimentary drink or anything. The seat was horribly uncomfortable, I had leg cramps in the whole trip. They don't have wifi onboard. The  only good thing about this airline is their cheap fare, but they easily suck your money by charging your baggage fee and a small carry on fee which you're going to pay more eventually than other airline where you can get better service with other airline company."

Awesome Frontier. $110 for a bag I had to handle myself that is the size of a breadbox. I will never use your airline again."

This would be my first and last time flying Frontier. No customer support, no announcements. You should put in your personal interest to check and keep the refreshing the flight status by yourself in your phone or on the screen. The flight was delayed for more than 7 hrs, didn't see a single attendee saying least a sorry for the inconvenience. Just left all the passengers. Nobody explained the cause for the delay. I missed my connection in to DC from Denver. When I called the customer care, waited for almost 40 mins in queue, finally when answered no empathy or understanding the concerns. The people over the phone doesn't even understands English. Totally the service is so horrible."

If I could rate this airlines as less than a full star I would. While the staff on the airplane and at the counter at the airport were more than helpful, their customer service is less than helpful. In fact they're quite the opposite than helpful. When I bought my luggage and seat with their perks program online, they charged my debit card double once for me and for the other person in my reservation. I called immediately and they said they would refund half back to my debit card. Well two to three weeks passed and I never got it. I called and was told that it was refunded to a card that didn't belong gimme or anyone on my trip. I called back after figuring this all out and they told me that it went to my travel agents corporate credit card. I spoke with my travel agent and she said that it did not go there. I called back again and was told it can take 1 to 2 statement cycles for it to post. I work in banking so I know it doesn't take this long. Especially since on the first call they told me 7-10 days. I ended up disputing this with my bank who I also work for and it is in process of being corrected. Frontiers customer service did nothing but pass the buck off to other people and offered nothing for an inconvenience. Not to mention that they're supposed to refunded the money back to the card charged as per the agreement with Visa and MasterCard. They never even apologized for any of this. And when I spoke with a supervisor they were also less than helpful and when I asked to go above them the supervisor said there was no one else which I find extremely hard to believe. While my flight was great, the inconvenience, the rudeness, and utter incompetence of their customer service makes me never wish to fly this airline ever again."

This airline could not get anything right. Their check in system via the kiosk is misleading. They will charge you for a carry on despite the fact that it is free. My family was split during the flight and we had to kindly ask a passenger to switch so I could at least sit with my 6 year old while my wife sat with our 2 year old. Then they proceeded to lose the second half of our car seat. I will refrain from reviewing their non-reclining seats, lack of wifi or screens, and nickle and diming fir all other amenities. Do not fly this airline unless you have no other choice. There are no savings just inconveniences."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham  to Trenton,April 2017,4.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flying from Raleigh Durham to Trenton on 4/5/17 with the upgraded “the works” package, bag was not loaded onto flight. RDU confirmed the bag was still sitting in the baggage area, after the flight landed in Trenton. Not sure how this happened, as they only run one flight out of RDU per day. Called Frontier immediately and was told the bag would be delivered on 4/6. Called on 4/6 to confirm and was told it would be delivered on 4/7, since they realized they don’t fly out of RDU on 4/6. On 4/7, called to confirm and was told it was delivered to the Trenton airport and would be sent by courier that afternoon. Received a message 2 hours later that they didn’t have delivery address, even though it was given to 3 different people, 2 in Trenton and one in Denver. Also, they were calling the back-up number of a family member because they had put in the main cell number as a fax number. Tried to call back, but no answer. Bag did not arrive on 4/7. Called Frontier on 4/8 to confirm delivery and was told it would be delivered that day. Received a call an hour later saying they don’t deliver in that area and would send by Fed Ex, with arrival scheduled for 4/11, a week after the flight. Called back to say this was unacceptable, that since they were at fault for this situation, they should rectify the problem and have it delivered on 4/8, even if it would cost them extra to hire a courier. Was told they don’t do that and the bag would arrive on 4/11, unless we drive to the airport and pick it up ourselves, which is not possible because we don’t have a car there. No apologies, no empathy, and no other options pursued. Our family has been loyal to Frontier over the years, with minor issues that were tolerated. However, this lack of customer service shows Frontier’s true colors. This airline is not interested in quality of customer service, but rather quantity of flights that can be booked and profits to be made. You are better off paying a little more for better customer service. You certainly get what you pay for with Frontier!"
❎ Unverified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Las Vegas,April 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  St. Louis to Las Vegas. For the third time in a row, my husband and I have been extremely disappointed in Frontier Airlines. Last spring was the first time we flew with Frontier. On our way to Cancun we had no problems, however we sat on the plane for over 3 hours waiting for take off coming home, which made us late for our connecting flight. The second time we flew Frontier was to Denver, Colorado from Kansas City, MO. Once again, we had to wait over an hour after we boarded the plane because they failed to fuel the plane before passengers arrived. The third and final time we will ever fly with this airline was this previous week. Coming home from Las Vegas our flight was scheduled at 12:35 am, the airline boarded early, resulting in them refusing to let us get through security because we were ""late"" although we arrived over an hour before departure. Not only did we not get to board our flight, the next flight out was not until 10 am the next morning, with a 9 hour layover in Denver. Once we arrived in Denver we were informed that the take off time would be delayed 2 hours. I have NEVER been with an airline that consist of so many delayed/cancelled flights and mechanical problems than with Frontier airlines. In addition, it is absolutely insane that Frontier charges for a carry on bag, especially when they charge more for a carry on bag and a checked bag. Horrible airline and even worse customer service."

✅ Verified Review ,,Business,Economy Class,San Antonio to Portland via Denver,April 2017,1.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," San Antonio to Portland via Denver with Frontier Airlines. This review might be different than others in the sense that I was unable to even go on my trip. I was supposed to fly out of San Antonio. I got to the airport an hour and a half prior to departure with my electronic boarding passes from the Frontier app, as instructed when check-in done last night. I followed the sign that said ""drop bags,"" since I was pre-checked. I waited in line for approximately 25-30 mins, while realizing there was something wrong because only agent was taking at least 10-15 mins with each passenger. When my turn came (40 mins prior to departure) I was informed flight had been delayed to 3pm , and possibly 4pm since plane had not left Denver. I would lose my connection to Portland. I was told I would not make my connection in Denver today, so I could take their next flight, tomorrow afternoon. I was supposed to attend a national conference in Portland the next morning. They could not place me in Portland until the following evening. There was no assistance to place me on another airline's flight because as was told ""we have no alliance with any other airline."" My only option, get a refund and look for another flight myself. The ""refund process"" was started but I was not given a receipt because I was told, ""the email was sent, and once they approve it they will send you an email with information."" This is supposed to be within the next 7-10 days, I was informed. I was given a screenshot as receipt by the rep, who voiced being the manager on site, but who wasn't willing to give me his name, because of security reasons? I was unable to fly another airline because my other 2 options (late night flights) would cost me U$500 one-way. Needless to say, I went home extremely frustrated and sad at the lack of empathy, ethics, or responsibility from this airline. Not to mention the many other cancellations I had to do because of this irresponsibility. Do yourself a favor, pay a little more and fly an airline that will guarantee arrival at your destination, or who would graciously assist you to get on another flight, if need be."

Seats are uncomfortable, checking bags at counter is a nightmare, and be prepared to wait up to an hour for luggage to come off plane. There were 100 plus people in line at Palm Beach and zero employees at the Frontier Counter less than two hours before our flight. You must check bags at counter to fly. People were running to make the flight because the line was so long. Chaos at baggage claim when we landed. Not enough handlers to remove bags. Horrible. "

I will agree with others that the seats are a bit uncomfortable however there was plenty of leg room. Sure you don't get inflight entertainment but bring a book. It's also not a big deal that you have to purchase soda. You do get water complimentary and if you need snacks make sure to buy them ahead of time in the airport. The thing I don't like is that you have to pay for carry on and seat assignment but otherwise it was a good, smooth flight on a clean plane. I had a direct flight and no issues with delays.

I have flown with them twice since their prices were somewhat better but I think I will pay more for for a better experience with another airline. I flew the same route (Dulles, to Orlando then to San Diego) and both times my bags did not show up. Not sure what goes on but bags from dulles apparently get left in dulles and make it on the next flight which is ridiculous. They charge 40 dollars for a checked bag also which I never got refunded even though they said they would. They charge for soft drinks which every airline I've been on its usually complimentary. The seats are uncomfortable and the space is extremely small. Again, terrible experience both times I've flown and will never fly with them again."

Its really easy to be successful if you understand how this airline works, and that it is a discount airline. The planes were perfect, flight attendants were nice.

The last two time I have used Frontier Airlines both March of 2016 and March of 2017 they have cancelled my flight and put us on a earlier flight without notifying us. In 2016 we were on a red eye flight and when I printed my boarding pass I seen they changed our flight to leave at 6pm instead of 1159pm I had one hr to get the 4 of us to the airport to catch my flight. Well this year or flight was delayed 2 hrs and we were forced to sit on the plane with no air or anything to drink. On the return flight we were on a 550pm flight returning to Denver. We got up in the morning to print boarding pass at the hotel. When we went in they again changed our flight from 550pm to 920am, we missed our flight and never had a notice it was changed. Well they could not get us on another flight into the next day, so missed work a day and had to pay for hotel for another night. We had paid for extended seating on the 550 flight but did not get it on the new flight and were told we could upgrade for 50 per seat in the same seats we already upgraded role 1 and 3. Frontiers seats are so close with no leg space so the person behind me had there legs under my seat and his boots were in the way so I could not even put my legs down without resting them on his boots!  I have one more flight with Frontier coming up in May and will never fly with them again."

Plane was very uncomfortable , the flight attendance were VERY rude, and the wait for everything was unusual long! The flight attendance were rude when speaking to the passengers. The flight attendance sat in their seats for most of the flight (not a bumping flight) and were rude to passengers when they needed to use the restroom.

In February me, and my sister decided to take a trip to Punta Cana and meet up with our brother and his family who flew in from Europe. My sister was in-charge of booking the trip, and at first I was not happy with her choice to fly with Frontier Airlines. Frontier being a budget airline, and the reputation of nickel and dime'g by the budget airlines was kind a turn off for me specially flying international. From the moment we settled in the seat I was wrong about the perception I had of Frontier Airlines. The seats were very comfortable and one flight attendant was exceptionally friendly and kind. Hardly ever experienced the kind of friendliness and welcoming attitude from a flight attendant ever before. We constantly bugged him to buy more drinks and nuts and he was always there with a smile.

I booked a flight to Seattle for $165 round trip. When I went to check in online, I was charged an addition $116 for a checked bag, one carry on, and my seat (because apparently your seat isn't included in the purchase price), via ""the perks"" option. This charge stated it was my additional cost for my round trip flight. There was no in flight entertainment, they charged you for refreshments (that they only accepted debit or credit as payment for), and they passed out credit card applications to everyone on board. The seats are miserable and the plane lacked cleanliness. Next came my return flight. I flew out at 6:40 at night. I wrapped up work, and headed to the airport 4 hours early, to check my bag, so I wouldn't have to drag it around. Unlike United, they only show up two hours prior to departure to check bags for the flight, though none of this information is told to you when you purchase your ticket. They also refuse your bag 45 minutes before departure, leaving one hour to check everyone's bags, so the line was huge, and the ticket agent showed up 20 minutes late!! When I finally got to the counter to check my bag, I was charged another $60, and was told ""the perks option only covers a checked bag and carry on on my initial flight, and only my checked bag on my returning flight. Unreal! The return flight was exactly the same as the one here. I basically paid a total of $350 for a crappy flight with poor customer service. I will never fly Frontier again."

We pre-paid for our checked baggage, and arrived at the check-in counter 42 minutes prior to departure. The employee behind the desk informed us that they do not allow checked baggage later than 45 minutes to departure, and that no one was available to bring our bags to the gate. I asked if she could check with the luggage people, she would not. I asked if the other employee at the counter playing on her phone could help, she said they were not going to the gate and could not help. After realizing the lost cause we discarded $80 worth of toiletries to get through security. Upon arriving at the gate, the same employee was there (even though she said she wasn't going to be) and there were 2 luggage employees sitting at the top of the jetway playing on their phones. Apart from the lack of customer service, both the employee and her supervisor were incredibly rude and condescending. In addition the seats were cramped, the drink service was horrible, and they nickel and dime you for everything.

Once on board the gouging continued, with very expensive snacks/drinks - no free water from these guys. I ended up paying over $400.00 for a ticket originally quoted at around $260.00. I will never use this airline again. Even at a what I thought was a high price, SouthWest was a bargain. On a positive note, the crew were extremely courteous.

Then upon entering the plane, we were taken out of line and charged $60 for a small carry-on which could have fit beneath the seat in front. The fee was not indicated at the time of ticket purchase. Therefore, we attempted to question the ethics of charging an unadvertised fee, and the representative at the gate was extremely rude. Specifically, she said to take our issue up with a representative of the company (which we mistakenly thought that she was). Once boarded, we discovered that the seats were primarily made of molded plastic with very little cushion. In fact, there was so little room that our knees were up against the seats in front. On top of that, during the flight, the staff was rude to the customers on the plane. They charged $2.95 for a small soft drink. There was no inflight entertainment. And they kept hawking their Frontier credit card for a charge of $69 annually. Never again will we fly this airline!!"

Spoke with a supervisor and was told that if they made an exception for me they would have to do it for everyone and change the policy. I don't think anyone has said that to me since my 1st grade teacher. I indicated I was a frequent flyer with them and would not continue to fly if they were not able to accommodate a simple mistake and asked point blank if they were willing to lose a customer over $80 and they still said there wasn't anything they could do. I will never fly with them again. This was icing on the cake to all of their hidden fees and dirty airplanes with ""pre-reclined"" seats.

I have used a lot of airlines in my lifetime, but Frontier was the worst, by far. Arriving at the airport they charged us for our luggage (40-45.00/per bag). That alone put us over the amount offered by competitors. Plus they charged us again on the way back! We were going to use the kiosk to check in, but they said we would still have to wait in the enormously long line (1 hr). We get on the flight and the seats are like lawn chairs, and they don't recline! The serving cart comes down the aisle and we find out that we have to pay for everything but a small cup of water. On our return flight there is a delay (2 hrs). We arrive at our stop-off in Denver to catch our connecting flight, but that flight leaves 15 mins before we arrive. We go to the customer service desk and they tell us that our flight from Las Vegas wasn't delayed and that we just missed the flight. I tell them it was delayed by two hours. Finally, after two hours of waiting at the desk till midnight, they admit that the flight we just took was delayed. They tell us that there isn't another flight until the following evening, but that was booked. Finally, the shift supervisor shows up and gets us on the flight the next evening and gives us a voucher for a room at a hotel. Of course the following day we have to be out of our room at 11am, so we have to find somewhere to hang out until that evening when the flight leaves. The food vouchers are only good at the airport and they are for 10 and 15 dollars which doesn't go far at an airport eatery. Plus we have to pay for cab fare from the hotel to the airport to use them, and that is about 15 miles away. We finally get on the flight the next evening and sit on the tarmac for an hour so that they can de-ice the plane (1 hr). Of course we arrive late in St. Louis and wait another hour for our luggage. This is the worst run airline I have ever used. The trays are the size of an iPad, the seats are about as uncomfortable as you can get. The pilots were good, despite the horrible weather coming into St. Louis, and the attendants were good too. That is the only good thing I can say."

I would not take Frontier again. Attendents are polite and the flights are nice not rough spots or anything. However, this airline will charge you a $40 fee for checked baggage or $45 for carry on, even if you have a lay over from another Frontier flight. I flew from Ronald Reagan Washington With Frontier to Denver and paid the $45 for carry on. I had a 3 hr layover in Denver to Salt lake. They wanted me to pay the $45 again before boarding for SLC. $90 for carry on baggage for a flight with layovers? We can't control that, I'm sure we would all appreciate direct flights at any given time. I do. You also better pack your bag with treats and snacks. They cost money on the flight too, besides water. That is free."

Paid double the ticket price to check in bags. Flight was $75 and the baggage fee was $145. My son flew this flight. I flew 2 weeks later from San Francisco to Atlanta and charged a completely different baggage fee carrying the same exact item. Called customer service to ask ""Why?"" they have no answer and said it's up to who ever checks you in. From SFO to ATL they misplaced 1 bag, they allowed a daily spending fee and dropped off the bag on a Sunday at 3am. The daily fee was minimal. The cheapness of the flight is made up in fees. No drink or food without being charged besides a small glass of water."

Downloaded my boarding pass and pre-paid for a checked bag (don't give you the first bag free). Got to the airport and still had to stand in a long line to drop off the checked bag. No curbside valet. Ended up standing in the regular check-in line, as the bag drop line was longer and crawling. Guy I will assume was the supervisor told me to stand in the bag drop line, but the one he directed me to was wrong. Employee behind a counter rudely told that only people on last call for their flight could immediately drop off their bag. Everyone else, regardless of how they paid or checked in, had to stand in line. Add to that Frontier charges for a carry-on beyond one personal bag and there isn't any reason to choose this airline over a more expensive option. Going to stick with customer-centric lines like Delta, United and Southwest. Last Frontier trip ever."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Kansas City,June 2016,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Philadelphia to Kansas City. Frontier Airline seemed a decent choice because it was relatively cheap but still had valid times for the trip we had planned in May this year (2017). However, as things happen, we had to cancel our flights due to unforeseen circumstances. It was only as I requested a refund that I realized we would be charged 100 dollars each for cancelling the flights almost 3 months in advance. This is absurd; while I fully admit that I didn't familiarize myself with the cancellation process, being charged almost full price anyway despite not even using the airline is outrageous and certainly unethical. I will be going out of my way to avoid using Frontier Airlines again, and they must be persuaded to more fully and faithfully advertise the costs associated with their booking process. I do not recommend this airline, especially if you're running on a tight budget and can't afford ridiculous charges in case of a change in plans."

Be careful with Frontier Airlines, by far the worst experience from flying out to the customer service. I'm from Sacramento and I took a flight from San Francisco because it was 100$ cheaper. I would much rather pay 100$ extra than to fly with Frontier in the future. No snacks or beverages - they charged for everything. They have no free carry on baggage - I had too pay 80$ there and back. I figured out now why it's so cheap and so uncomfortable. Instead of saving money I wasted more than I planned to.

I was to have a 48 hour layover in Orlando and then make the connecting flight to San Diego. My itinerary states that I would be on the same flight for both legs of the journey. When I arrive in Orlando, they tell me I missed my flight and the plane I just was on was not leaving the airport. The earliest they could get me a flight to my destination was literally 24 hours after I landed in Orlando. All of the hotels were booked so I had to sleep on the floor of the airport until my next flight. Frontier Airlines refused to compensate me in any manner for their mistake. Now I am waiting to get on my newly schedule flight when it is delayed 3 more hours. Mind you, this is like deja vu because the plane was coming from D.C. And is to be taking us to San Diego. So how is it that the plane today coming from D.C. Was taking me to San Diego but I missed the flight yesterday? Frontier did not acknowledge this. My trip was to be Thursday night to Monday morning. I literally lost over 1/3 of my trip because Frontier Airlines messed up. And they will not take responsibility. Everyone I have spoken with has been discourteous and rude and refuse to compensate me for spending over 27-28 hours stuck in the Orlando airport. Frontier Airlines do not care about you or any of their customers. I wish I would have known before I wasted so much money and time to hang out in an airport."

We (7 of us) had no problems with this. We had everything we needed in one backpack. No food or drinks on the plane. We knew this as well, just make sure you eat before or buy snacks before you get on the plane. Uncomfortable seats. Our flight was short (under 3 hours) so it wasn't so bad. I wouldn't recommend using Frontier for international travel as that might get a little uncomfortable. Plane was clean. Everyone we encountered with Frontier Airlines was very nice and accommodating. Our flights were on time. We arrived 2 hours early just to make sure that we got checked in. (I read that some people were denied access because of a late arrival) Again, we each had one bag that fit under our seats so no lost luggage. If we lost it, it was on us. Hope this helps!"

However, I have to say from the beginning to the end, it was great. I got a great last minute deal and had no problems.  I feel that the people that have a disaster flight tends to vent the negativity. My favorite part about the flight was their food and drink menu, it had a wonderful selection, happy hour deals! Must I say anymore. I've flown all airlines and never seen this. I wanted to speak out amongst all the negativity against them. I flew for half the price and ""flew right"" as they say."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Minneapolis,January 2017,2.0,3.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1,  Denver to Minneapolis. There can't possibly be an airline worse than Frontier Airlines. First we were forced to pay $100.00 per ticket to change our flights a month before flying. When booking we neglected to pay an additional $6.00 each to choose our seats. I didn't believe that meant they would separate our two seats that were booked together. Is this enticement for us to pay additional money to secure seats or enticement for us to never fly frontier again. We are electing to never fly Frontier Airlines again. I don't care if we have to pay more or encorporate layovers in our future travels. Frontier is an embarrassment to the airline industry.

Nice seats, complimentary snacks and free carry-on bags. When we flew back to Seattle from Denver we flew Frontier as both flights came as a package deal using Travelocity. I wasn't aware that Frontier had a carry-on fee of $30. When we got to the gate a Frontier representative announced that if you have carry-on bags you should have a ticket with that annotated it on it. We did not have that annotation. We were forced to pay $60 per bag to take our carry-ons home. Then, while on the plane, I witnessed passenger 18C ask the attendant if he had to pay for his bag in the overhead stowage. To my disbelief she put his bag in the stowage and said don't worry about it. Lesson learned: act dumb and they'll not worry about the fee. To add insult to injury, the last 20 minutes of the flight we were bombarded with the flight attendant advertising their credit card and it's benefits. They went so far as to pass out applications and have passengers fill them out before they got off the plane. Besides that, the seats were uncomfortable on the A319 without the ability to retract and little to no leg room. Needless to say, I will not be riding or recommending Frontier to anyone ever."

I was already upset about this and my waiting time, so while I looked at different airlines for an earlier flight, asked the rep to wait for 2 minutes. After quickly finding a better flight with Southwest, I looked at my phone and the representative had hung up! Had to recall again and wait another 30 minutes just to ask for a refund. Had to book the flight with a different airline and spent about $100 more than I needed to. Not to mention my flight coming to Denver from San Francisco earlier (this was a round-trip flight) got delayed 4 hours! Frontier has rude and unreliable customer representatives, poor flight services, and always have delayed/canceled flights. Pledging to not fly again with Frontier in 2017.

First off the appearance of the staff from this airline is not professional. My first flight out was from MSP airport with flight to Denver, that was delayed no real reason was given as to why the delay had occurred. Upon our late arrival to Denver my connecting flight to Phoenix was boarded therefore we were late and missed the flight. No fault of our own, so the attendant at the gate said to see the customer help desk. Which did not really provide any real relief besides saying she can get us on a flight out tomorrow granted it's barely 3:30pm Tuesday. I began to tell her that's not good enough why do I have to lose a whole day for a mistake that was made by Frontier. She than said I can put you on ""stand by"" which I proceeded to ask what that meant, she said I can maybe get you out on the flight for Phoenix at 9:32. I was not pleased with this either but I needed to get home Tuesday night not Wednesday. But this was just a maybe nothing was certain so that also caused my wife and I stress because we don't even know if we're getting home. So we began to wait what other option did we have, than as no surprise the flight is delayed once again now it departs at 9:50 so we continue to wait and than it happens again! Another delay this time it change to 10:50. Frontier has been the worst airline I have used and I do not recommend it. Failure in communication with customers, poor customer service, rude staff, and overall lack of professionalism throughout the company. Granted I only got to see what it is like in Minneapolis and Denver but that's all I need to say I will never fly with Frontier"

We made a family vacation to Florida, and was looking for a direct flight to come back to SFO. Only Frontier and United came in my search and looking through price difference and availability I preferred Frontier (given some of the better experiences we had 5 years ago flying Frontier). Going through the booking, with all the fees for each and every step, I somehow felt that my family will deserve a good trip back after a great vacation and so I took the first few row seats paying that 45$ fee/ seat. At MCO, when I came to check in the lack customer service bothered me but I was thinking it would improve once onboard. But everything went south and I should be thankful now for that agent in MCO because rest of those I met along the way are much worse. I don't know how they can employ and run a company which is pathetic. Seats are so hard you cannot sit for more than 2 hours, Pilots do not give any information during take off, mid flight or landing making this feel like sitting in a black hole for 6 hr flight. Once you land in SFO, to pick up the luggage it takes closer to an hour. We couldn't even find a ground crew to ask questions and the entire Frontier desk was deserted. So many families traveling with kids like me, by then are left helpless with even the number listed on airport call doesn't work. One of the worst experiences in my life and would never step my foot on this airline or recommend this to anyone."

We found a flight out on a different airline and ended up paying more for the one way flight than we paid for the roundtrip to begin with. Our trip was shortened by one day and we had to make adjustments for the car rental and condo as well. Frontier was absolutely no help on anything. They could not even answer the phone. Don't fly this airline if you want to arrive at your destination. They are not reliable. Take your own food as it is $4 for water or a snack.

We arrived at the Cancun airport to a one hour delay. This is understandable. At the baggage check-in, I was informed I would have to pay 40 dollars to check my bag.  On the way to Cancun this was no problem, and we traveled with one bag for the both of us. Why was I charged 40 dollars? Then the delay extended an additional hour. Once we boarded and took off I noticed some of the worst service. The flight attendant kept treating customers like children and conversing with the pilots at the front of the plane for several hours, meaning passengers had to use the latrine at the rear of the plane, creating a long wait.  We arrive late to Denver, went through customs and arrived at the baggage re-check station. We waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, a fellow passenger dialed Frontier from their own phone for information. We were told to travel to the front of the airport and wait in line at the main check in station. Mind you, there were probably 400 people in that area.  After waiting 2.5 hours for our now delayed flight 571 to Salt Lake City in a line with no direction or information, we arrived at the ticketing counter for baggage drop. The attendants acted like they didn’t know anything. They informed us that our flight had been canceled and we would have to take one of two options. Wait and fly out on Wednesday (mind you it’s Sunday night at about 1230) or take a refund, which could take 5-10 business days to receive. Frontier offered no other help, offered no condolence for their errors and simply pushed us along and said not our problem. After an hour of frustrated searching through other airlines to discover it was a hopeless venture to attempt to fly out of Denver, we decided to rent a car and drive the 8 hours from Denver to Salt Lake City.

Mainly crisps and overpriced fuzzy drinks. Not good enough! The seats were old and tatty and mightily uncomfortable to sit on. Leg room was very poor as the seats were packed in like sardines causing severe discomfort. I know that plane toilets are never pleasant places but the ones on here were dreadful. Unflushable toilets, broken sinks, overflowing paper towel bins, yuck. The only good thing was that the hostesses (the same crew both ways) were kind. They deserve much better than this."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,STL to PHX,December 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My son and I booked a round trip flight from Phoenix to St. Louis on Frontier Airlines. This was my first experience with Frontier and in regards to the flight out, I was quite impressed. The flight left on time and the aircraft was clean and new. I was considering getting the Frontier Airlines credit card as I envisioned taking Frontier on a regular basis based upon my initial flight impression. Well, that all changed. After driving 3 hours to the airport and arriving 2.5 hours before our flight I received a notice on my phone that the flight from St. Louis to Phoenix was cancelled. No reason given, just cancelled. I went to the gate to speak with a Frontier representative. This was about 6:30 pm and I heard the poor guy tell the the woman in front of me that he had been on since 2:30 am as he asked her to please not get on his case. I spoke with him to inquire what my options were now that Frontier had cancelled my flight. He suggested I try American Airlines if I wanted to get home. He explained the flight would not be rebooked and the only thing I could do was get a refund. No voucher, no hotel. This is unacceptable. I booked a flight on Southwest (great airline) but the two 1-way tickets now cost me more than the round trip tickets had cost me on Frontier - much more. I realize this is a budget airline but lets get real. If they cannot fulfill their obligation by pulling a plane in, even the next day, to complete my contract for travel they should not be in business. In a similar situation, Allegiant Air gave everyone a taxi voucher to a hotel, a night in a hotel, and brought an aircraft in the next morning to complete the travel. That is the example Frontier needs to follow. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. Hardly a budget airline if you have to purchase a ticket from another airline at a much higher price to get home because of this airlines lack of service."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to CLE,December 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Denver to Cleveland via Columbus. Frontier is the worst business I have had an interaction with. I don’t know how they spread so much rage and still stay in business. Our flight to Cleveland was one of hundreds canceled out of Denver the weekend before Christmas. They tried to claim it was weather related, even though it had been beautiful for days and no other airlines were having these problems. Lines were horrendously long to talk to customer service and remedy our canceled flight. We were lucky and only waited a little over an hour. The customer service agent seemed like she could care less. She was not helpful at all. She had no recommendations for us. We were told we couldn't fly into Cleveland until Friday (this occurred at 9am Monday). We finally got out of her that we could get tickets on a flight to Cincinnati. Upon asking about our luggage that had been checked to Cleveland, we were told that our checked bag would be taken off the canceled flight to Cleveland and we could pick it up at baggage claim, recheck it on the new flight to Cincinnati. When we arrived at baggage claim there were hundreds or suitcases strewn around the carousels. After waiting half an hour, I was told that our bag was still going to go to Cleveland. Meanwhile, my husband was told to wait there and the bags would come up on the carousel in about 45 minutes. It turned out our bags would indeed be showing up. From the time the flight was canceled to the time the luggage made it back to baggage claim was almost 3 hours. The flight to Cincinnati started getting delayed over and over. As hope that we would make it to Cincinnati that night and still be conscious enough to drive to Cleveland ebbed away, we started looking for other options. We ended up getting on a standby list for a flight to Columbus and getting on that plane. With all this bouncing around between flights, I was told we could fill out a form directing the airline to ship our bag to us in Cleveland when it landed in Cincinnati. When we landed in Columbus I asked a frontier agent where I could fill out the form. She didn’t know what I was talking about! She told me to call customer service. More conflicting information, imagine that. I called customer service and proceeded to wait on hold for 2.5 hours! Upon talking to a person, she told me my bag had actually been pulled off the Cincinnati flight when it was discovered we were no longer on it and was in Denver. She took the address for delivery and said the bag would be overnighted. Imagine my surprise when I got a voice mail the next afternoon saying I had to call Frontier baggage at Cincinnati and provide delivery information because our bag was actually in Cincinnati! Six hours and 20 phone calls later, I was finally able to talk to someone who said my bag did, in fact, make it to Cincinnati and I had to give them delivery information to ship it. Does no one know anything? Who spreads all this false information to so many employees? How is it that one company can have so much conflicting information? This fiasco is the absolute epitome of incompetence. And my story is better than some others. I made it home that day. "

Then it was cancelled. The adjacent flight to Chicago was cancelled too because there was no flight crew. The passangers on this flight were deplaned. All were instructed to proceed to the ticketing desk. No explanation for cancellation. Later they claimed it was weather, and weather got blamed for both cancelled flights. As a result, hours of waiting in line to get a refund with the only option to get another flight on Sunday, or 6 days later. No compensation, no rerouting with a different company. We had to rebook tickets at a much higher holiday price for the next day and got stranded at the airport for the night. Frontier lacks in responsibility, ethics, and provides no customer service. This was our first and last booking through this company."

They tell you to get to the airport 2 hours before your flight, but Frontier gives notice of a cancelled flight around 90 minutes before the flight time (at least they give notice, I suppose). You're instructed to call a number to reschedule. Make sure you have more than 2 hours for this. If you're crazy enough to still want to fly Frontier, prepare for a multi-day layover at the airport. They won't have any flights, can't give food vouchers, and won't cover a hotel. At least they'll refund you money, if you spend another hour on the phone. Fool me once, shame on me. But consumers shouldn't be fooled in the first place."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PGD to PHL,December 2016,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I booked a flight in July 2016 to return to family for the Christmas holiday. The flight was out of Punta Gorda on 20th December returning out of Philly 3rd January. 10 hours before the flight I was sent an email cancelling the flight. Upon further inspection all flights out of Punta Gorda were cancelled. I was unable to contact a live human for over two hours on the phone and on the internet until I said that I wanted to book a new flight. When I explained to the agent what happened and wanted to know what were my options I was told that nothing was available until 25 December at 8:15 pm. This was the first time I booked with Frontier because of this new service between Philly and Punta Gorda - it will be the last. I understand that some tough business decisions sometimes have to be made but this was a real slap at consumers.

I had the worst customer service I have ever had In my life. I never received a cancled flight notification until 30 min before my flight was supposed to leave. Thank God I was there 3 hours early, and the airport staff was going up and down the line asking if people were flying to st Louis. One of the staff members pulled me out of line and told me to go into a delayed or cancled flight line. I had been in that line for over an hour, and that line was just to check my bag. I than waited in line to see if my flight had been delayed or cancled (At this time I didnt know which) an additional hour to be told yes my flight was cancled and that there were no other flights going out until Thursday. I asked if there was anyway they could help me find a new flight to St. Louis anywhere and they told me no they couldn't help me because they had no access to any other airline because of the way Frontier Airlines system worked. I told them I didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel and asked them if they would be able to give me a voucher to put me in a hotel until Thursday. They again told me no and that Frontier Airlines doesn't do those things when flights are cancled because of weather. They told me all they could do for me was give me a refund on my flight. I than found out my refund would not be put back into my account for 10 days. So I had no additional money to find another flight with a different airline. I told them that I had found another flight to st Louis going out to a different airport that was 2 hours away and that I could afford the flight but not the taxi to get to the airport, and asked if they could give me a voucher for the taxi. They told me sorry we can't do that either because of how the flight was cancled. The people at the desk told me that they were sorry for the inconvenience, but there was nothing they could do to help me get home in any way. They than gave me a number to call to voice my complaint and the number was out of service. So, stranded in Orlando with only 100 dollars to my name and absolutely no help from Frontier Airlines I had to than call and ask my parents to find me a way home. They were able to get me on a flight with American Airlines that was over 400 dollars. So 14 hours later and 2 flights, I was able to make it home without any help from Frontier Airlines. I have never been treated so poorly, and have never seen an airline that genuinely didn't care about their passengers as much as Frontier Airlines. I have received nothing. Not my money back, or an explanation to why things happened the way they did, or even an apology. I would never fly with Frontier Airlines again, and would never recommend this airline to anyone."

Our flight from New York to Denver set at 10.45 pm was delayed to 11.45 then again to 1.00 am. We were told check in started at 8.00 and she refused to take our bags or check us in at 7.58. We then arrived at our gate, only to find out that our flight had been cancelled. They told us it was ""weather"" even though all other airlines are fine. An unaffiliated baggage checker told us they were actually shortstaffed, a flight attendant hadn't shown up. They use weather so they do not have to compensate or gift their customers anything. Just calling and asking for a refund was a hassle, after spending upwards of an hour on hold. Fly United or Southwest. Save yourself the headache.

About 45 minutes later another notice came out. Then about another hour or so another notice. We checked in at the airport and went to the gate with the plan of waiting until four hours after we got there. It wasn't until another passenger advised us that the flight was cancelled. There was not a Frontier employee to be found at the gate or anywhere around. Shortly after we learned of the cancellation from another passenger, two Frontier Airlines employees showed up, and advised there was nothing they could do and instructed all of us to return to the ticket counter for instructions. Upon our arrival to the ticket counter we were advised the flight was cancelled due to weather in Denver. Not possible due to the fact we had another family member flying into Denver on another airline without any issue at all. Accordingly to several different sources, there were several ground crew for Frontier Airlines that walked off the job in Denver. Since the airline advised it was a weather delay their policies do not allow for concessions to stranded passengers, or so we were told. There was no offer to cover hotel expense, and the only option we were given was to re-book a flight for December 25th, which was the first available flight. Well let me say it is December 19th, and six days at our own expense in a hotel, and no other concession being offered, other than a refund, which would not be given for three days is not a good way to retain or gain new travelers. We had to book another flight on a different airline, spend $1100.00 for them, plus a $140.00 for a hotel room just to ensure we were home for the holidays. "

They cancelled the flight at first due to mechanical issues, then after a call to corporate it became a weather issue, even though no other airlines cancelled to Denver because weather was clear. After getting nowhere with customer service a manager was requested. He was useless and said his hands were tied, so we requested corporate, but they too declined to help. The only thing we were told to do was get a refund which would take 7-10 business days to hit our accounts, then go to the other airlines to make new accommodations. They said they could rebook us a flight but it would be late Thursday, basically 3 days of waiting. Lack of caring and willingness to assist us find other flights is appalling.

They cancelled my flight from Pittsburgh to Las Vegas and which was on Sunday and only offered a flight to replace it on Thursday. They were not willing to pay for hotel for the days I needed to wait for the later flight in Pittsburgh or pay for the Airbnb I got in Las Vegas for the days I missed. They took no responsibility for cancelling this flight. I ended up paying a lot to book another flight the next day with another company. Because it was last minute during the holidays all the flights were quite pricey. They only told us the flight was cancelled 20 minutes before it was supposed to departure. Saying they had no flight crew. Half an hour later they told us they don’t know if the flight is cancelled or not. Then an hour later they said the flight is cancelled and it’s because there was bad weather the day before. So because the flight cancellation is “due to weather” it is not their fault. This cheap flight ended up costing me a lot more than a regular flight. I would never fly with them again.

Our flight was then cancelled and then all customers waited in two hour long lines serviced by one Frontier agent. There was no communication by the gate agent at all except to advise that the flight cancelled. This airline is deceptive - you seem to be getting a cut rate price, but after all of the hidden charges, you are better off with Delta, American or United.

No reason was given as to why the flight was cancelled, there was no snow. Customers of Frontier are left with no options at all, no one to talk to at airport nor 800 number.

They delayed the flight online, then at 1am changed the flight back to on time, so I arrive on time. Just to find out that again the plane is delayed. The woman at the check in counter was stern, hostile and had no interest in accommodation. Customer service was not only poor at the ticket counter, but also on the aircraft. The pilot was the most friendly Frontier employee. And that says a lot since he's flying the plane and not even in the cabin. As the plane was about to descend a flight attendant was prodding people several times. I understand the need to follow regulations, but I wouldn't surprised if theres a bruise on my arm from this Frontier employee. Getting off of the plane was the next struggle. The same employee pulled 8 people up first, because they had connecting flights (the first positive thing thus far) and by doing this she sent people against the current to get their bags. I should never have to worry that someones bag is going to fall on my head. There were at least 8 people who couldn't get back to their bags. Come on Frontier, I've never in my life felt like such an inconvenience to a company."

The phone was ringing off the hook and the attendants ignored it completely. All the while ignoring the line of people in front of them to go leave and get food/drink for themselves. We then were delayed because the pilot didn't show up. We were told it was because it was snowing in Cleveland - which it wasn't. The police were called because one woman slightly raised her voice. We then boarded our flight after a 4.5 hour delay, only to sit on the plane for another 2 hours. We were told they needed to calculate rest times. We finally took off, the staff were rude, and didn't listen to anyone. They didn't offer us anything after waiting for 10 hours. Waited in baggage claim for 30 minutes until luggage came.

When I booked it was not made obvious that we would have to pay for hand luggage. I only realised when looking at reviews three days before. When we arrived we were told there was a 35 minute delay. Then after going through check out it it became 90 minutes. Our flight was due to leave 1125pm. It then started to show that it wouldn't leave till 330am. So far this was on the board and nobody talking to us. When eventually the ground staff appeared the attitude of all the female staff absolutely stank. The only person who seemed to seemed to empathise was a male agent. Unfortunately it was not long before he went off duty. When we tried to ask the female staff they told us to sit down and be patient and that it was a mechanical problem. People were asking for food and water and they were refusing. The airport was hot and every cafe was closed and we were not allowed out. At one point all the rest rooms were closed too. To add insult to injury the staff kept disappearing and returning with hot drinks for themselves. At 6am they gave us a 10 dollar voucher which didn't even cover the price of a bun and bottle of water. The delays kept changing to later and later. They gave people option of refund but would not say when you get luggage back so we did not take that option. Also at that late stage another flight have cost 300 dollars extra per person. It would also have taken ten days for refund to process but we would have taken the option if they could have been more specific about us getting luggage back. At about 8am the staff disappeared and the police had to come to calm everybody down. Frontier does not work with other airlines and they only fly to Orlando once a day from San Francisco and would have kept us there for two days at least had that plane cancelled. Anytime anybody complained they threatened to throw them off the flight. The most frustrating thing was not being given any proper information. They said we would get compensation of a voucher to travel with them again. We would never in a million years travel with Frontier again. I advise everybody to read reviews before booking with any airline. I made the mistake of not and lost a day of my holiday. We eventually left at 1050am. The cabin crew were pleasant enough but there was no food to purchase. Only snacks. Ridiculous on a five hour flight even without what happened to us. We feel we should get a refund.

When I checked Frontier reviews they were filled with negative reviews about terrible customer service and regular delays. I flew in on Delta, which by the way was comfortable and friendly, but the flight back would have been 8pm so i paid $10 extra on each ticket to book this earlier flight at 2:25pm so that I can get home and rest for work the next day. Well let me tell you what a mistake! I might as well have went with Delta at 8pm because Frontier had delayed our flight 4 times! Both for our flight and the one heading to Colorado. Apparently the plane headed to Colorado is in Cuba and hadnt left yet. And they are saying our flight attendants are on that plane and coming over to ours when they arrive. (As I type this we were delayed again to 4:30pm.) They have no Cordination. Believe the reviews! Also they charge $40 for baggage and $45 for each carry on that doesnt meet their measurements. They charge for drinks and snacks. When we checked in before this point we were given a huge attitude. One woman had given us wrong information about not being able to check us in, she also tried to immediately charge us for carry ons. We went to another lady and she checked us in and had us measure our bags which fit. So they are free. They still defended the first woman by claiming ""she's following the rules."" How?

The planes are outdated, dirty, have no wifi, do not have seats that recline and are poorly padded. They have no complimentary food or beverage either. Who charges for pretzels or coffee? The plane I am on right now is half empty and I am not allowed to move to the 3 adjacent aisles with the entire 6 seats empty in each row. Even though it's directly behind me. Not only was the attendant condescending and rude when I tried to move, he also went up to the intercom and made a speech about moving seats and looked at me with an eye roll. So unprofessional.

I fly quite a bit and on every other airline I have flown (i.e. Southwest, Delta, American) a carry on is complimentary. When I purchased my Frontier flight a month ago I was so proud of myself. ""$86 round trip! I love Frontier."" After all their extra fees I ended up spending $210 and that's with taking their ""Perks Savings"" option. Oh and then of course the flight was delayed by half an hour. No big deal, but they didn't even mention it. Not once did they apologize for that inconvenience. I almost forgot, they charge for water.

I had to go to a funeral in Atlanta, which would have been well over $1000 on a mainline airline, but was $200 on Frontier. Without that fare, I would not have been able to go. That meant a lot to me. I bought a roundtrip ticket from CVG to Denver, and added The Works package. Well worth it, because I got a nice seat, checked luggage, changeable/refundable ticket, and it was still far cheaper than a mainline airline. Frontier's pun emails are hilarious.

After 25 minutes on the phone with customer service it was decided that they didn't know anything either. I am traveling with my wife and our 6 month old son. We were supposed to land in Chicago at 10 pm. We are now scheduled to be there at 3 am.

In Denver, it took us 1.5 hours to just check our bag. There were only 6 customer service employees at baggage check. Then on our way back when we landed in Denver, we waited 1.5 hours again to pick up our bags. Nobody knew why our bags hadn't arrived at the carousel and they didn't seem to particularly care that we had waited so long. When I complained and asked for my money back for my bags, the woman I spoke with merely gave me the customer feedback phone number. I promptly called that number and wasted 10 minutes of my life trying to explain the situation to someone who hardly spoke English. She was completely unapologetic and said that there was nothing she could do and that Frontier only reimburses for lost baggage, not for 3 hours of my wasted life due to the incompetencies of Frontier and its employees. I will never fly Frontier again even though it tends to be the cheapest airline for me to fly. I would rather have decent customer service than a cheap flight."

Given all the extremely negative reviews I felt the need to share my experience. Frontier is a discount airline. There are no ""hidden fees"". They beat you over the head with all of their fees. ""Book your bags now for $25. If you book at airport it will be $50"". How people are surprised by this I do not know. You can easily log into their website. Calculate the seat fees. Luggage Fees etc and then compare to other airlines. The plane was nice - I was shocked. Plane took off on time and landed early. Yay! So based on this one flight I would give them a 10/10. I would use them again if I ever needed to travel for cheap and wasn't on a strict timeline."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PHX to MIA via DEN,September 2016,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Phoenix to Miami via Denver with Frontier Airlines (or at least that was the plan). I arrived at 5pm for my 7:40pm flight only to see that it was delayed to 11:45pm. Stood in line til 9:30pm to give them my baggage and get my boarding passes adjusted. I was informed that the flight from Denver to Miami was cancelled until the next day. There were around 100 people in line, getting extremely upset. They called over 4 police officers to ensure peace. After being told ""nothing we can do"", I was informed by another passenger that they were able to change their flight to Orlando instead of Denver and that Frontier was providing a shuttle from there to Miami. When asked why I wasn't informed of this option, the desk agent started making comments that no one told her that. I called home and informed my family that I was now going to Orlando and that I would be on a shuttle to Miami, they didn't trust that there would be a shuttle and that they would drive the 5 hours to Orlando to get me. Once I went thru security, headed to the gate, my ride went home to Tucson (a 2-hour drive). I sat at the gate till 11.30, until we we informed that we were now changing gates. We all moved to the new gate and waited. We were then told that the flight would now leave at 12:21. Since this change would mean I would possibly miss my flight to Orlando, I asked the representative if we would get there in time. He assured me that I would. The plane we were now assigned to landed and passengers got off. At approximately 12:25am, the same representative yelled out ""this flight is now cancelled!"" He then had the nerve to say ""You better hurry back downstairs so you arent last in line!"" Of course this caused a stampede of very unhappy customers. In between Frontier representatives at the gates and check in desks, we we given 4 different stories as to why the flights had all been cancelled, all geared to give Frontier plausible non-responsibility to its passengers! First, it was a ""passenger was ill"", then ""the whole flight crew is sick"", then ""a passenger died"" and finally ""the pilot has flown too many hours"". I called my family only to find out they were now 2 hours into a drive to Orlando to pick me up. Now they had a 2 hour drive back in a rainstorm, a 4 hour wasted drive in the middle of the night. My family in Tucson had just arrived back home when the flight was cancelled, but turned around and came back for me. By this time I had decided enough was enough and asked about a refund. I was forced to stand in yet another line for that since there was no way I would trust ""just go online and put in a request"". I was informed ""it would take 5-7 days to get my refund"". Another passenger said that all our luggage was piled up in several places in baggage claim. No representative informed us of this. When you got out of line to go search for your bag, you ended up back at end of the line again. I was still in line when my family returned from Tucson to get me. At 4:27am, everyone in line started getting emails from Frontier trying to bribe us with $200 credit for ""our inconvenience"". There were families with little babies, elderly people in wheelchairs etc, this was more than an inconvenience. I finally got my refund entered into their system. Ended up flying American Airlines, which cost me over $700 one way. Trying to fly Frontier is like gambling with a welcher. You have been warned."

We noticed on the departure board it had moved to 3.00pm, and then all of a sudden our flight was taken off the departure screen. Every single passenger was extremely confused, and nobody could find a Frontier employee in the terminal. Once 2pm rolled around, a large group of passengers had to go back to the check-in desk to find an employee. There were two employees who did not seem to care. When we demanded vouchers they did not provide them. I eventually demanded a refund and transfered to Southwest."

I upgraded on our return flight to reclineable seats but they were still uncomfortable. I will never fly them again. I have no problem paying for comfortable seats but even their upgrades leave a lot to be desired. They used to be good, but not anymore. I equate them with Ryanair over Europe who I will never fly. Sorry Frontier, but you have lost my business. The skimping on the seats have made them so uncomfortable that I would rather drive 24 hours to a destination than fly the hours on one of your flights."

When I went to check in online the night before the flight time had changed to an hour later, I had not been informed of this change. After an hour on the phone talking to two levels of management all that they offered was a credit note or to fly a day earlier.

Well then we find out it cost $25 to check a bag and $30 to carry a bag on and prices double if you check bags at gate so you have to do it early online. As we are leaving I notice my bag fits in the personal bag category. I'm happy as can be and ask if I can get reimbursed my baggage fee. I was told no, Frontier makes you pay for everything and will not reimburse any fees already paid for baggage. They nickle and dime you for every cent. It's unreal. This is the one thing that set me off - I'm not even complaining about the fact that the people were rude and the plane was delayed on a perfectly sunny day with no weather anywhere in the continental US. We also had a 12 hour lay over which is fine. They are incredibly frustrating though. Don't fly with Frontier.

When we told the Frontier employee he filed a claim and stated that we would receive our bags by midnight and they would let us know when it arrived.

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ATL to SLC,August 2016,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Atlanta to Salt Lake City with Frontier Airlines. Customers should note that if you choose to accept the lower cost of flying with Frontier they do not make any guarantee they will get you home in a reasonable fashion. We boarded the plane in Atlanta, taxied, sat on the runway for about an hour and then returned to the gate. As soon as we were unloaded from the plane I began calling the Frontier customer service line (a outsourced call center) to try to make it known that my husband was expected to work the following day. I also spoke to the manager at the desk in Atlanta who told me that she would make a note on my account but that nothing could be done until the flight was canceled. By 7pm that night it was determined that the fuel gauge was not working and that the replacement part would not be in that night. Thus following, the flight was canceled. We were the first ones back in line at the reservation desk where we waited for another 45 minutes. We knew that there was a flight out on Delta that night around 10:30pm that we could get my husband on unfortunately, after waiting to speak to someone at the desk regarding rescheduling, we were simply handed a piece of paper with the options of canceling for a refund (leaving us stranded in Atlanta), calling a ""customer service"" line to reschedule (also a call center with limited authority) with a $400 voucher or wait for a Frontier flight to get home. As we spent the next 2 hours working through these options with the hundreds of other stranded customers, we found that through the Frontier customer service line, the flight on Delta that was advertised through Delta as a $687 would actually be jacked up in price and almost $1000/ticket. For our family of 6, this option would have cost us about $3600 out of pocket. Booking a flight out through another airline the next day would have still cost us about $2000 out of pocket (after already paying $1100 to Frontier) for a one way flight. As this was just not a reasonable thing to ask any family to do, we inquired about when Frontier could get us home. The soonest flight they could get us home on was Thursday - 4 days after the time we were scheduled to be home, resume work and schedules for our children. This would not be a reasonable solution for anyone. We spent the evening trying to be calm and work with what we have been given. We talked to the manager who called corporate and were once again told there was nothing to be done. I am shocked that Frontier is able to employ people to be the punching bag at the airports for all of the stranded passengers. I am shocked that when tensions rose 7 hours after we were scheduled to depart, airport police were called to be used as Frontiers ""bouncers"". I am shocked that the only customer service available to passengers is a call center with very limited authority. I am shocked that as you sit on endless hold with the customer service line, the hold message is prerecorded with static followed by a pause to make the caller think they have lost the signal and thus hang up."

I was a huge Frontier fan and flew with them exclusively from the Cincinnati area to the west coast. Somewhere around 10 flights, but I haven't flown with them for 5 years. I was delighted to buy a cheap Frontier ticket. I used to love their chocolate chip cookies and personal TV in the headrest infront of you. I was looking forward to it. To my disappointment, this was a much different airline from 5 years ago. They replaced all the seats with uncomfortable and small seats (no TV). They charge extra for everything. You pay extra for carry on baggage ($30 at time of this review, and $60 if you forget and pay at the gate - price recently went up too). Extra for soda, snacks, coffee, and juice. Only water is complimentary. Oh and the ice. These à la carte type airlines really make you feel like they nickel and dime you. Plus we had really bad interactions with the stewardesses on both flights. One woman was rude to us on the first flight, and on the second flight two women were very rude to us. I would have looked past the poor customer service after the first flight, maybe she had a bad day. But both flights? Frontier should be ashamed."

The airline reply was that since they did not cancel the flight I would get nothing but a $15 food voucher. I find this inexcusable and will not use Frontier again. Also as a tip, even though I gave myself 3 hours to catch my airporter, it wasn't enough to compensate for an inept organization. And lastly, they charged me $45 each way for a carry on luggage.

Wouldn't acknowledge that no other flight going to NY was even delayed due to weather, but they use the weather excuse so they don't have to accomodate people in hotels. At customer service, employees (and I use that term loosely) told most that the next flight out was in 4 days. When asked what one should do, sleep, food etc, customer service rep told them to stay at the airport. After receiving a partial refund and booking 3 one way tickets the next day on JetBlue, my tickets, taxis, food expenses were an additional $500.

After reading the negative comments about Frontier, I was pretty nervous to give them a chance. I had to be in Atlanta last minute and they by far had the best fares. I'm a very nervous flyer and always choose airlines with the best ratings so this was definitely a first. Well needless to say, it was a fantastic experience and I will definitely fly them again. As long as you are prepared (as you should be) with extra fees, it's not a big deal. Also, you are allowed a pretty decent size purse for free. The seats are not bad. Granted my flight was not super long but they are in a semi reclined position and I dozed just fine. In my opinion, the seats are actually similar to some on AA and United flights as far as size and recline position. Yes, they don't cover the back of the seats with fabric and the trays are small but who really cares? I expected no legroom as I didn't upgrade and that was actually not a problem either. My legroom was the same as on my last AA flight. The flight attendants were just as nice as the ones on EVERY other airline I've flown, I didn't deal with the desk attendants directly. They came on at the same time as on every other airline clerk desk (a little prior to boarding). They seemed helpful and got a few last minute people on our flight who missed their last flight. You can bring snacks and drinks so you don't have to pay for them. I don't think the savings is worth complaining about pretzels and a small cup of soda. The pilots were great and more talkative during flight then I've ever experienced (which is fantastic when you are a nervous flyer).

My biggest complaint is the delay we had due to them not having sufficient staff. They wouldn't give the full story but they were scrambling to find a replacement. This caused a domino effect and caused us to be delayed in the airport from 10pm until 1am. Secondly, the seats are so uncomfortable.

From Bozeman, Montana to Denver, there was only one flight all day, and it was at 8:59 in the evening, and the only flight to Indianapolis out of Denver was at 11:59 pm the next day. So we had to get a hotel in Denver ($200) just to wait for the flight back to IND. After killing time all day in Denver, while en route to the airport, only about 5 hours prior to our flight, I get a text notification stating that my flight had been cancelled and gave me a number to call to rebook, with no explanation as to why my flight was cancelled. I called the number, and after being on hold for 15 mins, I am told that the only other flight available was 2 days out, which was unacceptable. I had to go to work the next day, and am not able to sit and wait around for two days. I elected to cancel the flight, to which I was only offered a credit, not a full refund. We then had no choice but to book another Flight for the next day through another airline. This cost us $850! Not only that, but we had to get yet another hotel for the night, which was $130. We went to the Frontier service desk to see if we could get any sort of reimbursement. The line was super long and slow, and took us about half an hour of waiting. Once we spoke to the woman behind the counter, she told us she could book us for the next flight two days from now, and that she could give us a hotel voucher. Not wanting to wait until the last minute to book a hote on a Friday night and take the chance of being sold out, we had already booked a hotel. We informed her we had already booked one, and she basically said there was nothing she could do. I asked if I could get my money back instead of a credit, and i was told no. After this experience, I really hate to go back and use that $340 credit with this airline, yet I hate to waste $340, especially by just handing it over to this company. Any other legitimate airline company would have done more to work with those who had been stranded. This was extremely inconvenient, and I have lost all respect for this airline. Despite all the bad review, I gave them a shot. Guess I should've listened to the reviews.

There was absolutely no benefit to flying Frontier. The staff on and off the plane were very rude. They did not answer questions about flight delay. Just told me to wait and watch the board. Cannot find any flight updates on line. Worst airline experience ever. This airline does not even deserve a 1 star.

On the last route, my flight was delayed (for no apparent reason such as weather or airport conditions) for over four hours. I tried to call customer service, but their phone tree is obviously designed to discourage an interpersonal interaction. While waiting at the gate, there were further delays and no communication offered as to when we could count on flying. A decade ago, I flew Frontier almost exclusively. Now, they have become THE airline to avoid. With pricing that isn't even undercutting the competition, uncomfortable cabins, useless points, no beverages, and ridiculously expensive fees for even carry-ons, I'm sad to see this Colorado business turn from good to bad to worst (no typo there)."

I paid the extra for the roomier seats and knew the carry on was more expensive than checked bag, so I put everything in checked and saved money by not taking a carry-on. The check in personnel were very polite as were the gate crew and flight crew. Flight was on time both ways. I bought my own drink and snacks so didn't have to worry about buying food on the plane. All prices are disclosed when you book, so plan accordingly. I do miss the TV's that they used to have. And all seats have shrunk on all transportation anymore, unfortunately.

Not only do you not save money after paying all the extra charges. No free bags, not even a carry-on - they cost $40, or $60 at the ticket counter if not prepaid. $35 for checked bag prepaid, plus extra to sit together and not even a free beverage or snack, the seats don't recline. And it was too close to the seat in front to put your head down if you're even if of average height. It was extremely uncomfortable. Never again will we fly Frontier Airlines. "

I paid to check my large bag and had to pay an additional $40 for my carry on. I have never been charged for a carry on before. I didn't have a personal item and my carry on was too large to be considered a personal item. The woman who checked me in at the counter was nice but the woman next to her was very rude and refused to help us. We were next in line so we approached the counter and she refused to help anyone from our line. She took a different customer from a separate line with no explanation. The third woman at the counter helped the people who were behind me in line. It was very obvious that we were next but could not get help. I have flown with frontier several times in the past and have not had any problems. I would prefer to pay a little more and not have any surprises when I check in and be treated with respect.

The agent at the desk told me flat out I had no options but to wait for the next available flight out of Denver (which was 24 hours later) and was completely unhelpful in helping me find another city out of Denver that could maybe connect me to Raleigh. I was told I was not eligible for food or hotel vouchers in Denver because the delay was weather related. The agent then told me to call customer service so they just gave me the complete run around and each passed the buck on to the other. No one at Frontier actually had the power or interest in helping me. The soonest I could get to Raleigh was July 25th - four days after my initial departure/arrival date. They could not book me another ticket on another airline because they don't partner with anyone. Frontier exhibited the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. I will never fly Frontier again. Thankfully I bought insurance so I was fully refunded for my flight and I rebooked on Delta, though at a very high cost.

After reading the number of negative reviews prior to my flight, I was concerned about my booking. The reality, I had a wonderful experience. It is true that you pay for baggage and seat assignment, but that is advertised upfront prior to purchase of ticket, so a traveler should not hold that against the company, because it was not a hidden cost. The only negative I saw was that they did not have a representative to check baggage before 2 hours of the flight, but again, to lower the cost of airfare, they cut the cost of staffing during those times. I like getting to airports early, but that again is not a fault of the airline. Once the line opened to check baggage, it was quick. My flights were on time for the most part. Departure was a little late leaving Nashville, but was not the fault of Frontier. We arrived on time in Denver and my connecting flight to San Diego was also on time."

Outside of that, everything is downhill from there.  I was traveling with my two small children. If I wanted to sit with them, I had to pay extra per seat to select my seat. When dropping off your bags, the staff were rude. Even though you are paying to check bags, they treat you like you are an inconvenience for them. The thing is, it's actually cheaper to check bags than it is to carry bags on the plane! I understand giving really cheap seats and charging people for everything; however, it doesn't make sense to make it cheaper to check bags.  Once on the plane, their prices are reasonable for food and drinks. You can get alcohol for cheaper than most domestic flights. The seats don't recline, they have almost no padding, the armrest is tiny, and the tray is about the size of an adult hand. The flight itself was okay. The ride was smooth and the staff on the plane was friendly enough.  I feel that maybe Frontier doesn't get gate priority from airports and you should be ready to wait for a gate when you land. When returning home, we waited on the runway nearly an hour.  Getting my luggage was pretty easy and fast once I was off the plane. If looking for a cheap flight where you get charged for everything, go with this option. If you want comfort, then don't. I did find out though that it's better to book your flight with Frontier directly and pay for the ""Everything"" package. I guess you get first shot at seats in the front of the plan and everything is included at only $50 more per ticket. These seats are more like actual airplane seats, not really first class."

That was almost more than my ticket. Then when you go into the airplane the seats are uncomfortable. Then for a 4 hour flight they don't give you anything.

I am average size and also a runner in great shape and if the seats are miserable to me I can't imagine the average Joe liking them either. Whoever designed those seats has surely never sat in them. I guess the only positive is those plastic hard seats breed less germs than fabric but after trying to sleep in a non reclining plastic chair on a red eye flight I'd rather have a few germs on a comfy fabric seat.

The plane ahead of us was still at the gate but didn't leave for another 1.5 hours. So sitting on the plane for that long is just absurd.

We were told as passengers by an agent on the plane that we would get $200 flight vouchers and they would be sent to our emails automatically. When I didn't get one after a few days, I emailed Frontier, who replied that due to 'weather cancellation', I was entitled to no credit. Most frustrating part is the plane we were on, and removed from, had to be sent someplace else. No flight was available for three days, yet the airline had an empty place just sitting there. Customer service agents are very young and poorly trained. They showed no concern that their company's action would cause people to be out of town for Easter weekend.

Even though I had booked months prior, Frontier's site showed the available seats for the flight with a price on each one, starting at an extra $16 per seat. The website explained that by paying additional money to choose seats was the only way they could guarantee seats together. What a scam and rip-off. I opted to not pay additional money and on the next screen it showed I had two seats together. Next I had to choose if I was bringing carry-on or checked luggage, all of which had ridiculous fees. Ended up paying $70 for two checked bags for the flight there and $60 for two checked bags on the return flight. In addition to all the extra fees and hassles with checking in, the flights and service continued to get worse. The seats do not recline at all. The seat base and seat back are molded together as one piece. They are rock hard, and looked like a cheap plastic resin chair and then it was covered only on the top side with a pleather like material. These seats are extremely uncomfortable, especially since my flights were over three hours each way. Once in the air, they offer their ""beverage service for purchase"", another lousy service. Yes, even for a can of soda they charge you $1.99 What a lousy airline. On my return flight, there were some open seats. They announced that if anyone wanted to move to a slightly larger seat at the exits over the wings, they would move them for a $50 fee. I will never fly with them again."

My experience with Frontier was displeasing from the moment I started my check in process. The machine my boyfriend and I checked in on told us that we would have to pay $16 per seat in order to get seats next to each other so we paid $32 total to sit together. We were traveling with two friends who decided not to pay $16 and be assigned random seats. However, they were seated right next to each other anyways. So we paid $32 for something that our friends got for free. The next screen told us that we would be charged $30 for each checked bag (which we expected) and $40 for each carry-on bag - $40 for a carry on. I have never flown on an airline where I am charged for a carry on bag and certainly not one where it is more expensive to carry a bag on than check one. After we paid for this I went to the counter to ask the employee if all of those charges were valid. Not only was she unsure of the cost of a carry on bag but she was trying very hard to avoid all of my questions and check my bag and get me out of the line. She then told me that I could have just combined my purse and my backpack to make one personal item and I could have avoided the carry on fee all together. So I said OK and asked her to refund me for the $40 I had just paid for the carry on, to which she replied that she couldn't do refunds and gave me an 800 number to call. She told me to call before I boarded my flight and that she was making a note in my reservation. I called the number and chose the ""baggage"" option which routed me to an office that closes at 4 and immediately hung up on me as I was calling at 4:15. I called another number that was on the sheet and they informed me that the office never closes and I needed to just keep calling. (Ridiculous). I called again and just chose a random option so that I could be routed to a representative. This representative told me that I could not call about this before my flight and that I would have to call the next day, directly contradicting the employee at the airport. So I called again today and got another representative who said that they would not be able to offer me a refund as the employee at the airport did not make a note in my reservation. I told him that the employee specifically told me that she was making a note on my reservation. At this point he asked me for my call-back number in case my call got disconnected and then put me on hold for 10 minutes to ""check my reservation"". Finally he came back and said that he would process my $40 refund which is about the only good thing that came out of the whole situation. Not only was I infuriated at all of the extra charges but the flight was extremely turbulent and the lights on the plane kept turning on and off which is very frightening and not once did the flight attendants or the pilot make any kind of reassuring announcements to inform us of the situation other than to ""ensure we had our seat belts on"". There was no explanation. I did however get a good laugh when we started to descend as the flight attendant said over the intercom ""please make sure you seats are in an upright and locked position"" because our seats didn't even have an option to recline. I do understand that Frontier offers cheaper flights and that is the sole reason why my friends and I decided to book this flight. However, we ended up paying about as much as any other airline after all the baggage fees and seating fees that are charged when you check in. I will not fly Frontier again."

However what was even more annoying was that the ticket counter was not open until 3pm (when I had a 5:30 flight) I had gotten to the airport early thinking I could check in get through security, eat, do some work and relax. But nope you have to just stand there waiting until someone comes to the ticket counter and then run up to security and just feel used. Please, pay more and fly with someone else!"
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to IAD via DEN,March 2016,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I was traveling from San Francisco to Washington DC to attend my cousins wedding. Flight was delayed originally for 1 hour that ended up being a 3.5 hours delay, that caused 25 people including me to miss their connecting flight in Denver. The flight in Denver didn't wait for 30 minutes for 25 people, yet Frontier delayed the flight in San Francisco for 3.5 hours due to bad weather! Upon arrival in Denver with the connecting flight gone, the Frontier airlines customer service desk was crowded by 100's of other travelers who had a similar issue or cancelled flights. Their customer service people were the rudest and clueless as ever. People were told to wait at the Denver airport for 3-4 days until next confirmed seats on a flight is available again. Long story short I had to ask for a refund for the missed flight since it was their fault, and ended up purchasing a one way ticket to DC with United airlines for a ridiculous $520; since Frontier Airlines was only offering a ""Partial Refund"", or, ""We can put you on a flight back to your original departure destination"". Horrible and miserable experience in my case and I'm sure other fellow travelers won't disagree. I've promised myself to never fly again with Frontier Airlines; and will urge other fellow travelers to do the same. "

We had to stand in line again and almost missed the flight because (according to them) we stood in the wrong line for 45 min and they would not check us in. From what they said there were signs for different flights but outside, where we started, there was only one long line and nobody knew where to go.

The seats are small cramped and do not recline. There's not even first class. They charge for all snacks and beverages. The second experience (right now) I had to spend the night in Seattle so I could catch my flight in the morning, arrived in Denver at 3pm (late) and my flight was supposed to leave at 11:15 but now it's leaving at 2:45am because the flight staff is flying in from Orlando. It's a horrid inconvenient mess.

However, when a company hired me and paid for a ticket with Frontier in March 2016, I was happy to try them again. After trying to check in at a kiosk, I was told I needed to see an agent. After an hour in line, the agent said I might be denied boarding. I waited another hour in the security line. At the gate, I was told to wait, so I waited another 45 minutes. The flight was oversold, and I was bumped. I went to customer service with two others who were ""involuntarily denied boarding,"" and I learned the airline is required to offer a stipend to anyone would would like to give up his or her seat (""No one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing""). I heard no announcements. Subsequently, I missed a presentation that meant a great deal to me. I was told I would be ""automatically reimbursed"" for my ticket - which was not true as reimbursement required an hour on the phone with an agent in the Philippines, and I was paid what a friend calls a ""kiss-off fee."" The others bumped from the flight received a lunch voucher and found seats on a United flight that night at a higher cost. I went home. Never again. Absolutely never again."

I can see now why the airline is promoting these new seats as eco friendly. Just an aluminum frame with a hard shell and about 1/4"" of padding in the back, a little more in the seat cushion. No more TV monitors in the seat back, no more reclining mechanism to add weight, head rest no way. The tray table will now hold 2 plastic drink glasses and that is it. These seats are fine for small people, every man sitting near me was complaining about how uncomfortable they were.

What ultimately made my decision to never fly with Frontier Airlines again, however, was their complete lack of customer service. I had a flight from Seattle to Miami with a layover in Denver. There was a staffing issue which caused the flight to be delayed 2 hours. Upon arriving in Denver, they announced that all passengers with connecting flights had already missed their connection and needed talk to customer service to find a new flight. The customer service desk had two individuals who had no idea what they were doing and a manager, who basically working both desks. I was 5th in line and it took almost 2 hours to be helped. They explained that the customer service agent in Seattle was instructed to put most of us on different flights so we could get to our destination faster and she’s not sure why that didn’t happen, she also said that there is no way they would hold flights for 45+ minutes and “the customer service agent [at SEATAC] knows that.” She then explained that I had two options:  Get on the next flight to Miami, departing the following evening at 11:55pm, or they could refund the cost of my ticket ($234) and I could fly with a different carrier. That doesn’t sound too bad! I pulled out my laptop and found a flight for $219 with United that departed at 8:27am the next morning. I showed them and said I’d just take the refund but was informed me that they can’t issue refunds at the airport and that I had to call some number to get my refund during regular business hours. At least I wasn’t trying to fly to Orlando. Two of the other passengers were put on flights that departed on Thursday and it was Monday. The following morning I call the number given to me and explained the situation but was told they can only process refunds that are submitted by a customer service agent at the airport and ultimately wasn’t able/willing to help me. I go back to the airport and talk to the manager at the ticketing counter who explained to me that Frontier was actually being very generous offering a partial refund and they were only doing it because Frontier messed something up with the staffing which caused the delay, they said “the delay was totally preventable.” He then explained that he did have the ability to give me a full refund, and I felt so relieved for that brief moment before he told me that he wasn’t going to give me the refund, because “I already used part of the service.” Ultimately, while I paid for service from Seattle to Miami, and Frontier only provided service from Seattle to Denver, that because some service was provided, even though it wasn’t what I paid for or what I wanted, that the transaction was perfectly fair. I had to burn another vacation day for work, sit in an airport for almost 24 hours, and Frontier could have prevented this entirely. At the end of the day, if there is anything I am sure of, it’s that if something does go wrong, you can be sure Frontier will do absolutely nothing to try to help you - even if it was 100% their fault."

The new website is a nightmare. I have spent over an hour this morning trying to navigate it.

We were allowed one smaller carry on bag for free, and we were charged $35 each way for each carry on bag in the overhead compartments.

I've flown friends and family out to visit me from those locations as well. It's great for a weekend or 3-4 day visit. Seating is not incredibly comfy, but as someone who is 5'8"" and 140lbs the seat fits me well enough and was fine for the less than 3 hour journey. My father is 6'1"" and he fits the seat as well. He preferred an aisle for the room to stretch out. The tray table is small, but I was able to prop my Kindle Fire 8.9"" table up on it to watch using the stand on the cover. Food and drink : not tried any of the snacks (I brought my own). The first trip I was on crutches and didn't want to walk back to a vending machine in the airport so I bought a soda on the flight : cost $1.99 for a can. A little pricey but with $38 roundtrip for the flight, that put me at exactly $40 for a round trip to Denver. Boarding and staff: all the flights I've taken have boarded within 10 minutes of listed boarding time, no delays, and have arrived early. One flight had a medical emergency on the flight, but still landed in a timely manner. The staff has always been friendly or at the very least non-cranky. Some people just don't have bubbly personalities but were still polite. When on crutches everyone was insanely nice, giving me extra time for boarding, helping me stow my crutches in the overhead and getting them out for me at the end.

I find that they cycle some amazing promos every month or so and you can get incredibly discounted trips as long as you're flexible on your dates and are booking 1-2 months out. I've flown Denver for $38 and Vegas for $75. That's round trip, non-stop. I can't even drive there for that price! Get the e-mails. Be flexible. Understand what counts as a free personal item: a backpack. I recommend the Motherlode Weekender JR if you're flying them often. It's a good investment that meets the dimensions. I also used a dell laptop backpack I have that meets them as well.  Use the app for your boarding pass! No fee and it's super easy. Who travels without their phone these days? Great budget airline if you shop the promos and pack light."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to IAD,February 2016,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,Orlando to Washington with Frontier Airlines. My first flight in 3 years and a fear of flying. Checkin was simple and fast. Staff friendly and nice. Could not have had better experience on both flights. Thank you Frontier for giving me the courage to fly again and the little reminder from flight attendants that I was safe - will fly Frontier whenever possible.
,,Business,Economy Class,DEN to MCO,February 2016,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier Airlines appears to be the most poorly managed business, I've had the displeasure of dealing with. Their website is not user friendly, they charge for every little thing so when you think you're getting a good rate on your ticket, think again! I chose the car rental offered on the website but later changed my mind. Tried to cancel the reservation but cannot on Frontier's website. They provide a phone number to call to cancel car reservations, but the phone number is to one specific car rental company, not necessarily the company you made reservations at. Our flight has been delayed now for seven hours - not due to weather problems though. We've heard several different stories from the Frontier staff on why the delay from mechanical issues, to changing out planes, to bringing in another plane from another state. Seven hours later, here we still sit, really? Keep in mind, we were not notified of this delay until it was almost time to board. We are told there is nothing they they can do, not another flight to get on, and cannot move us to another airline. We are told maybe we'll get a voucher in compensation for the delay to use on future Frontier flights. Useless when you will never fly with Frontier again. I suspect they are stringing us along only to cancel the flight altogether, then we will have really wasted our time and money. This is a business trip with four of us traveling together. We have invested a great deal of money on a trip that depends on an on-time arrival to our destination. This is not merely an inconvenience, it is a big deal."

I flew from Denver to Seattle with no problems but on my way home I encountered and huge in convenience. I had checked one of my suitcases at the check in thinking I take my carry on, on my flight. When I get to my gate there's an announcement made that if your boarding pass doesn't state carry-on you have to pay $60 there to put it in the overhead bin. I have a backpack, and my boyfriend and I each have a carry on suitcase. If I had known that I was going to be charged at the gate I would have checked it at check in. So I am forced to check my bag here. I am beyond mad. I tell the lady at the gate that I've never heard of being charged for my carry on before and she tells me the price is usually built in to the ticket price but to keep prices low they tack it on at the airport last minute. Even so someone should have informed me of this before I get to my gate. This is ridiculous, I've never been charged for a carry-on right before my flight. Not only that but my carry-one would have fit on the floor in front of my seat. Knowing this I will never fly Frontier again."

,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,IAH to DEN,February 2016,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Houston to Denver was my first and last time flying Frontier Airlines. I really have not one good thing to say. Getting checked in took forever and wasn't done correctly. We had to wait at the gate while they re checked us in. Once on the plane we sat for almost an hour in the most uncomfortable seat without explanation, we had to attempt to keep a 2 yr old happy during this time and were lectured by a flight attendant for letting the child move. The the attendants were rude. We had to return a day early because our 2 yr old was ill and the change fees were criminal! A drink of any sort will cost you and you'd better have a credit card handy. The flight attendants on the way back were more friendly but could not make up for all the minuses. Warning the miserable seats are so small and leg room does not exist so if you are any bigger than I am You will really be cramped. I am a 5 ft 3' 100 lb person. Hopes this helps someone avoid what could be a miserable experience."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SLC to ATL,November 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"They lure you in with low fares, but then nickel and dime you for everything. Guaranteed you will end up paying the same amount as other airlines with all of their surprise fees. The cabins are extremely uncomfortable - thin seats pressed together as closely as possible, and tiny little tray tables. I've flown with Frontier a couple of times, and each time the flights have been severely delayed without explanation. In November 2015, I was trying to get from SLC to ATL. My flight out of SLC was delayed and there was no gate agent to help anyone for the first two hours of the delay. In the meantime, people were already missing their connections and there was no representative from Frontier to help people. I ended up calling Customer Service because I was going to miss my connection in Denver, and the woman on the line told me that she couldn't help me and that I should just wait for a gate agent. Finally a gate agent showed up and she was grumpy and rude to everyone she interacted with. I told her I was going to miss my connection in Denver and that I would rather stay in SLC where I had family and friends than fly to Denver only to miss the connection and be stranded there for god knows how long. She said she could not re-book me from SLC, and the only way to get help with a new connection was to fly to Denver and they would sort it out there. This was during Thanksgiving week when it is extremely difficult to re-book. Terrible customer service, terrible accommodations, hidden fees everywhere."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to MCO,February 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Denver to Orlando with Frontier, I used to love flying this airline but standards seem to have fallen. Expect costs everywhere for everything. I thought Spirit was bad but shockingly, Frontier is worse. Their new seats are uncomfortable. Then waiting for the costly beverage service - we got passed twice and the staff started collecting trash before we were even asked if we wanted anything. I am now sitting at baggage claim over an hour after I landed and there are 2 Frontier flights ahead of us still waiting on their bags. One of the flights landed an hour before ours did. Do not waste your money with this company as they clearly do not value their customers at all."
,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,DEN to DCA,January 2016,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier used to be Denver hometown airline, not at all anymore. Whoever took them over last year has stripped the cabins bare. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable, narrow and packed together. I am a small person, 5"", 110 lbs. We flew from Denver to DC January 2016, 2.5 hour flight. I sat on my jacket the whole way for some cushion. I recommend bringing a seat cushion, like you would if you were sitting on bench for a game. There is no plugins for devices, coffee is $2 - really? You pay for everything. Pack your own water and your own healthy food, because all they have is junk food to purchase. Leg room, unless you pay extra, is non- existent. They charge for checked and carry-on luggage. By the time you add everything you need to a basic ticket you are paying more than most other airlines. They also make you buy a subscription to get the lowest basic prices. I always flew Frontier in the past, not anymore. Southwest is looking really good to me. Finally, getting the luggage out in a timely manner has somehow escaped them in all these changes, too few staff? At both ends we waited about 45 minutes for the luggage to surface from the bowels of the airports."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DTW to MCO,December 2015,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5,yes,8,"Detroit to Orlando return, and Frontier Airlines was great, staff was friendly, plane was clean, price was right. Flights were on time with no trouble at all. I read reviews before we flew with them and were expecting terrible service but it was fine. For the price I am not sure what they expect."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to DEN,January 2016,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Every time I've ever flown on Frontier the experience has been sub par at best. This last time my wife had a horrible experience with them that made me never want to fly them again. She booked a flight from Los Angeles to Denver. I've found their website to be horrible, and every time we put in our credit card it says that confirmation code is declined. After multiple tries it will finally accept our card. To make a long story short they had two transactions pending on our card and never informed us that the transactions where in fact declined on their end. The night my wife goes to check in they say she did not actually purchase a ticket. We had to fight the manager on the phone to get the price of the ticket close to what we purchased it at. There is a reason why this airline has such low ratings. For a 300 dollar flight from LA to DEN I get small rows, no carry on, no bag. "
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DCA to DEN,January 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier Airlines promote it as ""you get the basics"" from our low fares and then ""customize"" from there. Apparently the basics does not include luggage, beverages, or comfortable seating. It was by far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever used. What is worse is that we received an email that our flight was cancelled. My husband called to see if that was correct, spoke to a incompetent individual who not only answered the question if our flight was cancelled incorrectly (which it was not), but then proceeded to put us on hold and hang up on us. When we called back, they said that he had moved the flight (we traveled from DC to Denver and he placed us on another flight from DC to Denver!). The airline was terrible, saying that our seats had already been taken and that they could not get us on a new flight until three days later. "

Polite and helpful staff, great take off and landing. Flights were on time and at great prices. Didn't expect any frills for the price and none were needed. We'll fly them again. We have flown many other airlines and Frontier Airlines compares equally in most catagories."
,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to IAD,January 2016,2.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9,"Pleasant experience. Had no problems with the airline or either of these Frontier Airlines flights. I really like that they have a separate ""bag drop"" line from the ""check-in"" line. It allows those that check in ahead of time to get through faster. The staff at check in was very friendly and helpful telling us where to go after dropping bags. Orlando TSA is horrific, but obviously that doesn't count against Frontier. The actual flight was just the same as any other airline. Okay, you didn't get free peanuts and a drink! For this flight, I paid $340 for two people and two checked bags. I would have paid upwards of $600 for the same on Delta or United. It was also nice that flight attendants announced what baggage claim you can find your bags on before exiting the aircraft. That's a nice touch. My only complaint is that the A321 seats are rather hard and the tray tables are about 6 inches deep."

When I reached the Philadelphia airport 2 hours prior to the flight time, I got to know that the flight was delayed till 6:30 PM. After sitting and waiting at the terminal for another hour and a half, we were told that now the flight was delayed till 8:30 PM. After another hour, finally we were informed that the flight was cancelled. For the earlier delay, the reason cited was that the airplane was coming from an international flight so was checked by authorities. For the cancellation, they said that it is due to weather conditions. We could either get our refund, which was really low since I had booked 2 months in advance, or re-book the flight. The next available flight was on 4 days later. There was no advanced info about delay/cancellation and the customer service was very rude and said due to weather related reasons they won't listen to our concerns. When I finally did fly on the 1st January, the flight was again delayed by half an hour, the seats were highly uncomfortable and the less I speak about customer service, the better. I would never recommend Frontier to anyone."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,CVG to DEN,December 2015,3.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,8,"Cincinnati to Denver on Frontier Airlines. There were several agents to assist with check in and they were friendly and efficient. The flight was on time, even arriving early. No problem with baggage. The plane was clean and the temperature onboard was comfortable. The seats do not recline which is a plus in some ways as I didn't have anyone coming back into my space. The seats could have been more comfortable but seats on most airlines are not very comfortable. Frontier does a nice job of offering a discount trip. Other than having to pay for drinks, there is little distinction between them and the other carriers."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ATL to DEN,January 2016,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5,yes,9,"Before making our trip from Atlanta to Denver we had read horror stories about flying with Frontier Airlines, however, I wish to report that we were very pleased with Frontier. When you fly with Frontier you know up front what you are getting and what you are paying, so why complain about things that are saving you a great deal of money on your flight. I thought the seat comfort and room were comparable to other airlines. If you want more room, buy a set with more space. If you want a particular seat location, pay for it rather than complaining about your assigned seat. If you do not want to pay for snacks, bring your own, and they will give you water. If you do not want to pay for carry on luggage, purchase checked luggage. Our flights to and from Denver were on time or earlier. The only problem we had was in getting our checked bags at DIA. Things happen. We will use Frontier in the future, if the rate is better."
,,Business,Economy Class,PHL to CUN,January 2016,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"I was extremely disappointed that Frontier Airlines charged extra for just about everything on our trip to and from Philadelphia to Cancun. They charge extra for your seat at check-in, even those at the back of the plane that do not recline even an inch. Frontier not only charges for checked luggage, they also charge you for carry-on luggage. With luggage and seat costs, it cost my family of three approximately $300 extra. Frontier also charges you for a soda and juice. You can get water for free. In addition to the numerous extra charges, I checked in and was billed. I received a call about three hours later asking me to check in again because the system was not working properly. I am waiting to see if I get charged twice on my credit card for the two check ins."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PHX to SFO,January 2016,5.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3,"I would only recommend Frontier Airlines for short trips and if you have your own entertainment (computer, Tablet etc) and you bring your own drinks and food. Only water is for free and we only got on the flight from Phoenix to SFO not on the way back. The flight attendants were nice. Our flight back was 3 hours delayed and nobody told us about that or the reason. Even the crew didn't know what was going on.  Its more expensive to pay for a carry on than a checked bag. The nice thing is, that even in the normal Economy Class you have a lot of room for your legs. Not again if I don't have to."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AUS to DEN,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"This airline does not take care of its elderly passengers. Further it does not acknowledge poor service. Our 86 year old Mother with rheumatoid arthritis was not accommodated with a wheelchair upon arrival in Denver, she was told there would be one coming to get her, she waited at the gate for more than an hour, along with another elderly lady needing assistance. After asking multiple of times for assistance, knowing their families were waiting, they proceeded to walk the entire airport assisting each other. We called the airline the following day to report the poor service and requesting we be contacted to acknowledge our concerns for the lack of care for their Elderly passengers - that was nearly 3 weeks ago and we have not heard anything from them. We fly our mother to Austin yearly and sometimes multiple times yearly, this was our first and last time to use Frontier. I don't recommend using Frontier for elderly flying alone or children flying alone. They have the worst customer service I've ever encountered flying."

Denver to San Francisco, and delayed over 6 hours when all other airlines are on time.  They charge for everything except water. Baggage fees cost more than other airlines.

,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to ATL,January 2016,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"I took my daughter home for the holidays as I have done for the past 11 years. After she turned 14 on most airlines I don't pay an unaccompanied minor fee, however I have always been able to get a gate pass as a courtesy. They let me know it is a courtesy and when she is 18 that will stop and that is fine with me. During her first portion of her trip her father got a gate pass and was able to take her to the plane. On the flight back, I asked for a pass when I came to drop off her bags; I let them know that she was 17, the response of the agent was that she was sorry but children over 14 were adults and they should know enough to get to a plane. In LV casinos have enough sense to prevent minors from being alone after 10 pm. However, Frontier airlines have no shame in letting a child walk to a gate alone at 12am in the morning. I went back to the desk and tried to explain and another agent told me to ask TSA because there was heavy volume. I went back to the Agent at TSA and they told me there wasn't heavy volume. By this time I was very upset because I had no choice at this point. I work in customer service and the cold and heartlessness of these counter agents and the concern of my child's safety made me upset. I really didn't expect the lack of concern and caring about this situation."

This happened to our family off four during the holidays. Our flight from SFO to RDU was delayed for 7 hours. After 7 hours of waiting at the airport, we were told that ""unfortunately you will miss your connection in Denver and we won't be able to take you to North Carolina tonight"". When we asked what our options were, he suggested if we really wanted to be home for Christmas we should ask for a refund and walk to another airline's ticket counter and try to find tickets! Sure, it is the week of Christmas and all other airlines had tons of affordable tickets - all we had to do was just try! When we told the rep that was not really an option, he said ""well, I can take you to Denver tonight. Then from Denver every night we will try to fly one of you to RDU and by Christmas Day, you should all make it home"". Again, we did not think living at Denver Airport 4 nights and waiting for our family to be flown home separately a day apart each over 4 days was a serious alternative. There were dozens of angry, stranded Frontier customers were in line behind us waiting to get their chance to talk to the only agent there who had nothing to offer. We called  got 4 Delta tickets from Denver to Raleigh portion and flew back home. When we tried to call Frontier to request a refund, they argued with us about how much of a refund we should be getting. The refund they offered was 1/4 of our total purchase price, plus with new on the spot tickets we had to purchase out of our pocket, this trip cost us double the amount and of course, Frontier Airlines did not offer to accept any responsibility. Customer Service agents apologized saying they cannot offer any thing above this amount of refund which is predetermined by their airline and we should go to their website, look for a form to fill and send our request to their corporate offices. We will never fly Frontier again. We had the financial means to purchase new tickets from a different airline, what about the planeload of others whose flights were cancelled too and were told they needed to wait ""days"" to make it home? I still feel so terrible about an older lady trying to go to Phoenix to be with her grandchildren and agent telling her next possible flight will be in 48h - she kept asking us (she was behind us in the line) ""Can they legally do that ? Can they really keep you waiting at the airport 48 hours?"" I had no good answers for her. Frontier Airlines, you are supposed to be in transportation business and reading the previous reviews, it is my understanding that this kind of thing is common for you. It is disgraceful, terrible business."

We knew that weather could be a factor so we checked in several times prior to driving an hour to Chicago O'Hare airport. Upon arrival they even let us pay for all of our bags with all the additional fees for carry ons, full luggage etc. We asked if the flight was on time etc before we proceeded to purchase bags and try to get through security. We were just over an hour away from the flight taking off. They assured us we were fine before we paid. As soon as we walked up to our gate the flight was cancelled. We waited in line to see how they were going to accommodate us with another airline or a flight tomorrow. They offered us nothing except that they could get us on a flight 4 days later. We were told they couldn't do anything but here is a piece of paper with a number on it that we could call and see what they could do. Well what about our checked bags? They were on the carousel two downstairs we were told. We went down to the carousel and there were all the passengers one and not one representative was there at the carousel nor was anyone's luggage. The luggage was never even loaded on to the plane because there was no plane. It took over an hour and a half to finally track down an employee who finally took our baggage receipt. After 30 minutes they showed up with our luggage. I had never used Frontier Airlines before but did so as this was an economical fare and the only flight that worked with the timetable I had to travel back home to Florida. "

Rude crew, not accommodating and they charge you for everything even soft drinks. There is no inflight entertainment and row 4 doesn't recline for some weird reason. They were rude to my husband for carrying my carry-on because I was pregnant and went on the plane before him. They made him step out of line and threaten to charge him.  You end up paying over $100 on bags and drinks/snacks, you might as well fly someone else."

The next one wasn't until the 27th. So my mother resorted to driving 8 hours to Denver herself.

The seats were as comfortable as a folding chair, no padding, they didn't recline. The tray table was about 3 in deep and 6 in wide. Ridiculously small. No movie, tv, music, absolutely no entertainment. No wifi. Beverages were $2. Snacks were even more. We witnessed a flight attendant shout at an elderly man to sit down when he was waiting for his elderly wife (who was seated in the middle seat) to walk back from the lavatory. The flight attendant made him sit down for max of 15 seconds and then he struggled to stand back up so his wife could pass him back to her seat. "

Once they finally told us what was going on and that they had cancelled the flight and would be giving us a free flight the next day. I was so angry we called the hotel we were supposed to be staying at to push the reservation back a day. I suggest that you don't fly on this airline.

When I got to the airport, the ticket counter said since I was already checked in, I would have to go to the gate. When I got to the gate, no one was there until 30 minutes prior to boarding. Called the customer service number and all I got was an apology. I am going to miss a dinner that I paid a lot of money to attend, and an ""I'm sorry"" doesn't cut it. If you have the option, stay far away from Frontier. Their only solution which they stated a dozen times was to book me on the next flight four hours later. Unbelievably ignorant and uncaring."

So I decided to wait with my 78 year old mom with Parkinson's in a wheelchair. But then at about 6:10pm they said it was delayed till 11:45pm.  I wouldn't recmmend anyone fly this airline.

After the 2 hour disappearance it reappeared with a new flight time of 10.40pm, just as we are about to board the the plane at 10.45 the airline personnel actually made people disboard because of the lack of flight personnel. We were informed that the crew member was on the premises and it would take another 15 min before they got to the plane, after an hours wait, another captain from another flight made the crew board the passengers to get the process going. After an 8.5 hour delay we finally left for Atlanta. Got to our rental car company in just enough time to get the car drive to my sons graduation from army bootcamp without any sleep. Barely made it there because of this airline. No voucher, not even a free bag of peanuts. Never again with Frontier. Another delay on the way back from Atlanta to Denver, 6 hrs because of maintenance issues in another city."
,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Santa Ana,December 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,Denver to Santa Ana. I witnessed a Frontier Airlines employee assist a blind passenger this morning and I have to say it is rare to see such compassion and empathy these days. She went outbid her way to reassign a seat closer to the front even though the flight was full. I commend this employee on her present personality and willingness to go out of her way to take care of customers. Way to go Frontier!
,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,CLE to SLC via DEN,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Cleveland to Salt Lake City via Denver. Plane delayed 3 hours out of Cleveland due to mechanical issues. Cleveland agents would not confirm a new connecting flight because they said we would make our connection, which we didn't. We were told we were on standby for another flight, we weren't. Confirmed on a 6:30pm flight. Our original flight was supposed to leave at 5:30am. The employees have been totally unhelpful and so rude it is stunning! Even after a 3 hour delay of our flight they charged for drinks and food on our flight to Denver. We were emailed a $100 certificate for our next flight. No Thank You! This was our first time flying Frontier Airlines and it will be our last! Believe all the bad reviews and ratings you read. Fly someone else. There are plenty of discount airlines that will at least be helpful and considerate."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DFW to DEN,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"I think it absolutely ridiculous that Frontier Airlines now charges for carry-on luggage. Flew DFW to DEN. This fee was not well enough highlighted during the booking process, or I would have most certainly not booked the ticket-would have paid an extra $20 to fly with another airline that includes carry-on luggage instead of a total of $80 roundtrip with Frontier. I am a frequent flyer (although not with Frontier, to be fair) and hence well familiar with booking flights online, but this fee did not even cross my radar during the booking. Or if it did, I must have thought it so ludicrous that it was referring to something else. These extra airline charges are getting to be absolutely absurd. Who flies with only a purse? This has certainly influenced me to not choose Frontier in the future.

,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to Chicago O'Hare,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,We booked a nonstop flight from SFO to Chicago OHare. It is required to pay for luggage and only a purse size personal item. On our return flight we were delayed 2 times. Scheduled to leave at 7:55 and departure scheduled for 2:00 pm. Hopefully the last delay. Their other flights left on time. I would think they would try to get us a different plane. That didn't happen. Needless to say the low fares are not low after paying luggage fees and delays. No free snacks not even drinks. I will never fly with Frontier again.
,A319,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Denver,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"The seats on Frontier were very uncomfortable, they no longer have cushions and will not push back. So your left setting up in a prone position with a very small arm rest. Even worse the fold down utility tray is now only 5 inch deep, so because the space between you and the seat in front of you are so close now you can no longer use a ipad or laptop. No inflight entertainment anymore either, the seats are not big enough to hold a small 6 inch monitor. You pay $30 dollars for a carry on and for normal luggage. Onboard I felt like a I was strapped into a child's car seat in the floorboard of a compact car. Never again!"
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Tampa,December 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"I had been a long time supporter of Frontier Airlines for many years. Having flown on the airline likely over 50+ times in the past 10 years. Over the past few years I have experienced the steady decline in both service and quality, nonetheless continued to utilize the airline for both business and personal travel. My recent flight from Tampa to Denver represents one of the most disgraceful flying experiences. The seats on this airplane are not only poorly designed and uncomfortable, they are unsafe. These seats represent what happens when an airline crosses the line in an effort to cut costs. I will never book another ticket on Frontier Airlines."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to DEN via MEM,November 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,2,"Las Vegas to Denver via Memphis. This is the worst airline ever! I thought Spirit was bad, but nothing compares to Frontier. I traveled with Frontier Airlines on 11/24/15, going to visit my family for the thanksgiving holiday and I boarded from Las Vegas to Denver where I had a seven hour layover before reaching my destination. When I checked in at the ticket counter in Vegas I did not have any checking luggage but I did have a carry on bag but was never told by the agent that I had to pay for my carry on, neither was I told anything before boarding the plane. However, when I got ready to board in Denver, I was told by the lady who was taking the boarding passes that I had to step out of the line and go to the next counter because my bag needed to have a ticket associated with it. When I went to the counter the lady that I approached told me that I had to pay USD60.00 for my carry on. Of course I questioned that since I was not told that initially, I asked to speak to a supervisor but got no satisfaction from him. Said they were doing their job and the people in Vegas did not do theirs. This is my second time flying with Frontier and both times were bad experiences. The only reason I flew with them again was because I had a voucher from the first bad experience and was compensated for what my fiancé and I went through. I know they try to entice people with their low fares but they get you with their outrageous fees for baggage and carry on, which when you look at it you really is not getting a deal at all! If you could avoid flying with this airline, please do and save yourself the headache. I would not recommend this airline to anyone! Frontier Airlines put you through all that and their seats are not comfortable and nothing is free except water. "
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Memphis,November 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,I received a text from Frontier Airlines stating my flight was delayed by 2 hours which would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. So I called Frontier and they had no reason for delay and no other flights available that day so I cancelled the flight with refund agreed by agent on the phone. I then booked flight with Delta to fly on that date. I was told I'd receive refund from Frontier within 10 business days. Three weeks went by and I called them. I was told no refund and no record of my call. Be very careful with this airline!

The seats on Frontier were most uncomfortable, you pay $30 dollars for a cary on, $25 for normal luggage,from SFO back to Denver there was no place to put my carry on so I had to place it under the seat. Onboard the plane I felt like a sardine in a can. "

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,TPA to DEN,November 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Colorado had a major snow storm night before I was due to depart. My flight was 1159 pm and we left Colorado Springs at 4 pm so we could take our time. Well we hit icey roads and ended up totaling daughters car. Thank God we were not hurt. I called Frontier to see if I could change flight to next night since I wasn't about to ask someone else to drive dangerous roads to get me there, I explained the situation with the accident and road conditions and rep said sure we have room on next nights flight, it will cost $547 total. That is ridiculous! I can get last minute round trip flights for less than that. Anyway, I no longer care how cheap their flights may be, due to their lack of compassion and nickel and dining tactics, I will never fly with them again. I would rate them a zero if possible."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Detroit,November 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier went from my favorite airline to the worst in one trip. In addition to charging for everything (including the seat, checked and carry on luggage and in flight drinks) they changed planes again and the seats are small with no leg room. My flight back from Detroit to Las Vegas included a 8 hour layover in Denver, overnight, when the entire airport closes down. Can't even get a drink of water for 6 hours. The inflight staff is just about the rudest I've ever seen. They are annoyed with you before you even board, and don't need anything. The scoffs and eye rolling are free if you do. "
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Las Vegas,October 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,Milwaukee to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Terrible seats were like sitting on a sheet of hard plastic. The seats do not recline. There were extra fees for carry-on and seat fees. We have flown to Las Vegas for over twenty years and this was one of the worst trips. Not worth the savings flying with Frontier Airlines.
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,IAD to DTW,August 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"Frontier Airlines doesn't even deserve one star. On my way to a funeral from DC to Detroit, they lost my luggage on a direct flight. Minutes after the luggage was distributed, you can't find anyone at the airport from Frontier to help you out. The two adjacent airlines tried their best to help me but to no avail. I spent over 15 hours from the airport and at my destination trying to reach a person who can help me and no one knew what they were doing. I was giving alternate contacts that had nothing to do with lost luggage. I spent hours trying to reach a live person and 90 percent of the time I was disconnected. Although I gave everyone I spoke with my number to call me back after being disconnected, they promised to call back and no one ever did. Left numerous messages at the Detroit airport but I was called back Monday morning to let me know that the luggage was found at their office and I didn't not receive it till Monday late. I spoke to several supervisor to let them know that all my clothing, cosmetics, etc were in the luggage for the funeral that weekend and they said go ahead a purchase the items. When I tried to get a budget, no one would give me a figure. On my return to DC, I filed the 3rd., claim with the person in charge at the office. Gave her the receipts and I assumed all would be well. It's been close to three months now and many, many follow up calls and the same untrained phone customer service people who get you no where. Finally someone informed me that I can file a complaint on line. I couldn't believe that I got a call from the Detroit office claiming that they never received messages from me. I assured her that I have phone documentation to prove how many calls I made to Detroit and the national number. She then informs that I should have been give an authorization to purchase items. I screamed at her that no one ever told me that and that I tried to ask for a budget and no one would address it. She asked me to email her the receipts because the Detroit office didn't have them. The apparently lost them, and it was my responsibility to resend them to me. She gave me a gmail number which surprised me that it was not a Frontier email. Guess what - the email kicked back. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever received from anyone. Although people think they are cheap, after you pay all the extra, they were much higher than Delta. Never again would I ever use them."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MCI to SEA via DEN,November 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3,no,5,"Kansas City to Seattle via Denver. I chose Frontier Airlines for a one way flight back home to Seattle from Kansas City. All in all, Frontier was mediocre. Pros: cheap airfare, flights on time or early, convenient flight times , customer service was pretty good.  Cons: charge for carry in bags, additional charge for seat, no complimentary snacks or beverages offered in flight (other than glasses of water), minimal options of food and beverage for purchase, no in flight entertainment of any kind. Almost no padding on seats - tiny (half size maybe?) tray tables, no wifi. I may fly Frontier again for short trips, but it's not up to the standards of other airlines as far as in flight experience goes."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Chicago,November 2015,3.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9,"Frontier Airlines was the smoothest flight I've been on. From the checkin at the kiosk, the flight and baggage claim. Everything was on time. I didn't have to wait more than five minutes for my bags. The flight was great, the price is unbeatable. To top it all off we flew right over the city skyline and turned right over lake Michigan, it was beautiful. Definitely flying Frontier again. The only down part was leg room, but there's even an option to upgrade of you want!"

I talked to airline employees from gate agents, to ticket agents, to flight attendants, to customer service employees. All were unhelpful. They could tell that I was an irate customer. I would think they would want to make me feel better. I'm not asking for free stuff. Just a smile - which I never saw. They advertise low prices but dont tell you they will charge you $40 to carry an item on. $2 for a coke. $5 for a cup of coffee.  I will never fly on Frontier again. "
,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CLT to PHL,November 2015,,,,,,1.0,1,yes,1,"This review is to prepare other Frontier ""possible"" passengers of the potential additional costs of flights. Due to a family emergency, I quickly found a flight to be with an ill family member. The most direct flight at a reasonable cost was selected - It just happened to be Frontier. The cost was slightly less expensive than other carriers. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, I was impressed and even purchased the ""DEN Discount"" for $49. That was then. Today, I see there's a $30 fee to Carry-on my luggage. (Yes, I said carry my own) baggage. Then there's the $6-25 fee for your seat. That's an extra - $82 costs! After I realized, I was more cost effective using another carrier and that I would never fly Frontier again. I asked to be refunded for the DEN Discount. Sorry the rep said after 24 hours it's non-refundable.  My flight isn't even scheduled until tomorrow. After looking at these reviews - I'm regretting my choice to go Frontier! Run, Passengers - Use another provider who's up-front andre reliable! Boy, do I wish I did. 0/10 for overall rating."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Denver,October 2015,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1,Frontier Airlines is absolutely the most awful airline. Hidden fees. Terrible times. Horrendous website. Paid for their 'Discount Den' and cannot use it online - keeps asking for me to re-pay. Can't e-mail directly with concerns until after the fact. Service has deteriorated over time. Just awful.
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ATL to MCO,October 2015,4.0,4.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Frontier Airlines explains everything about extra charges for bags, seats etc. My family and I flew to Orlando this past week and could not have had a better experience. We got the tickets dirt cheap $152 and I did not choose seats and checked in 1 bag. Our family was seated together. Staff was helpful and welcoming. I just hate to see the negative reviews about how they charge for everything - they explain that to you when you book so it's your fault if you choose to ignore it. I paid for 1 bag round trip and the total price for 4 tickets was $202 which is $50.50 each. Best deal around by far. I have flown on Delta, US Air and other major airlines and I haven't had a perfect experience with them and 1 ticket cost more than all 4 of mine. "

My son is active duty military and returned home last week from a 8 month deployment. I had seen Frontiers ads about inexpensive fares, and since the military does not give you more than a few days notice, I decided to fly them. After booking them through Orbitz (package deal) I loved onto Frontiers website (not easy to use) and choose our seats. To my shock, you had to pay extra for your seat ($9-30) AND pay for your luggage whether checked or carryon! Really? I asked customer service about the seat charge. If you want to sit where you want to, you must pay the extra fee. My husband is tall and needs extra leg room. The head flight attendant both directions were very cranky, the seats do not recline, but the topper is the charge for anything other than a half a cup of water (2.5 hr flight)! Coffee, soda or a bag of peanuts are all $1.99! So in closing, if you add up all of the fees tacked on we could have flown an airline that we actually enjoy! "

This was my first time flying with Frontier Airlines, I will never do so again. My tickets were purchased from Frontier's website, so I was hoping for a good experience. I checked in online the evening before, printed my boarding pass and paid for my bags. I was thinking that I was good to go. When I got to Frontier's counter to actually check my bag, this is where the problem began. The kiosks weren't working, so people who were flying couldn't do this part, and had to wait for a counter person. This caused a huge back up. When I finally got to the counter, the clerk said you aren't going to be able to check your bag, you will need to take it to the gate and see if they can do it there. Then all of us had to go through the TSA checkpoint, which normally is pretty efficient, but not today. They decided to take my ""bag"" and go through it, which then caused me to miss my flight. I had to then go to the counter at the gate, wait for someone to come and find out what to do next. They rebooked me for later, to leave Minneapolis at the time I was to arrive in Portland Oregon.  I'm not happy, very angry as Frontier employees just seem to be unconcerned for my plight. "

Due to a nationwide computer glitch my flight was delayed 1.5 hours. The ground crew professed to have no information about where our aircraft was, when it would arrive, or the impact on the ability of myself and other passengers to make connections. They repeatedly broadcast to the passengers that there was nothing they could do. Despite this glitch, the ground staff stated that the flight was oversold and that they could book willing passengers on later flights (this, to me, seemed to contradict their statement that they had no information on any other Frontier flights). I detest airlines that do not state fees up front which is tricky when buying through Expedia or other sites. I had the nasty surprise of having to pay for cabin baggage ($30). I was unfamiliar with Frontier before this trip, and will not fly with them again. Lack of communication, lack of information, frustrated ground staff, late flights, missed connections, bag fees, seat-selection fees."

Their approach to customer service was fantastic and who wouldn't love the chocolate chip cookies they served in flight. Fast track now to 2015 - my hubby and I needed to make a trip to Denver from DC for a medical specialist appointment. The trip out was uneventful but we saw significant changes from the Frontier we loved back in 2009. This airline has been transformed into an ultra low cost carrier (eg Spirit Airlines) and as I have learned since my flight, was purchased in 2013 and torn apart by Indigo Partners. Our return trip on Oct 5th was an absolute nightmare. While the surgeon was late for my appointment, this cut us very tight at DIA. Security lines took over 50 minutes (one of the most inefficient TSA operations I have ever seen and I fly a lot for work). We ran through the terminal to the gate only to find out that they flight had left early and there were no more flights back to DC that night. We were sent to Frontier's customer service desk in DIA's A terminal and they were completely worthless. Were willing to rebook us both (for a $95 fee x2 of course). We paid it after contacting other airlines and determining there was no other way to return to DC that afternoon/evening. We were left with a hotel bill for a night we hadn't planned, an additional $25 in parking fees at DCA and lost work for both my husband and I. I have tried calling multiple times but no one will return my call. Very dissatisfied customer who has learned her lesson and will not fly the 'new Frontier' again."

Let me just say, I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to those reviews. My flight from Houston to Denver was an absolute breeze. We took off early from Houston and got to Denver early, and we didn't have to wait to be deplaned. I highly recommend upgrading your flight to the ""works"" when making the reservation. I will definitely fly Frontier again."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to MIA,September 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"After booking the first thing I was charged was an ""occupancy"" fee. Isn't it implied that I'll be occupying the plane when I buy the plane ticket? My girlfriend was charged to bring on her purse. Keep in mind this isn't some outrageous huge purse. This is a small 12 inch purse. But still we were charged for that along with our carry on bag. So after already being in a bad mood from paying the hidden fees we get inside the plane. The seats were uncomfortable, provide no personal space and I spent the entire trip with some guy laying on my shoulder. Don't get hungry or thirsty unless you feel like paying even more. The only positive comment I will give is there was a fox painted on the wing of the plane. That's not spectacular but what else was there to be excited about on this plane. If you're thinking about flying on this airline I suggest you walk. you'll have a better time."

Upon reading the fine print about baggage fees, I went on Frontier's site and purchased their classic plus option. For a little extra added on to the ticket, I was able to choose my seat, add checked/carry on luggage, and not pay anything at check in. They sent me an email with the details of the flight a day before with advisories on when to be there. The staff at both check in counters were efficient and friendly. Both flight crews were knowledgeable, and friendly. Here's my advice to all that are in it for a cheap flight, check on the airline's website for fees, and rules. The other airlines charge more because they add those fees in the ticket price already. You are going to pay one way, or the other."

I have been a Frontier Airlines supporter and used to like the airline. After flying on an aircraft with the plastic seats and 6"" tray tables I will never fly on Frontier again and go out of my way to let others know how miserable the airline has become. In addition the website seems to be incapable of understanding an expiration date on a credit card. Sold me baggage tickets and then credited them back out. Tried to charge $13 for seats behind the ones I got for no charge. Refused to offer aisle seats. Looked like plenty of people are still willing to put up with this experience."

This added $92 to my flight cost. Round trip will be $184. The seats are ridged and dont recline. A greyhound bus seats are better. Most uncomfortable flight ever. 
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AUS to ORD,August 2015,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"I purchased my tickets from Frontier Airlines and after a satisfactory trip to my destination, my return trip was absolute misery. Frontier cancelled my return trip and I was stuck for 2 days without a way home. I tried customer service several times. There was always a long wait and it always took several times explaining to get my message across. Finally, a rep promised to offer a full refund and email confirming such. I never received the email and never received the refund. After I finally returned home on another airline, Frontier Airlines customer service once again would not honor their word for a refund. Frontier is fine to save a few bucks but if you have any problem whatsoever, don't expect it to get resolved."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Orlando,September 2015,1.0,2.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"Only positive of our Frontier Airlines trip is we arrived from our flight from Vegas to Orlando.  If you are planning to book with Frontier you might want to consider their business practices. The price they give you is not the price you are paying. There are surcharges left and right. They consider any suitcase, regardless if it is a small carry-on or a checked bag, an optional service and charge you 30 to 50 $ per bag extra. This is not disclosed properly on booking sites. So if you plan to bring anything aboard you will be charged extra. They also charge extra if you want an exit row (its their version of first class). They want to charge you for a soda. I basically did not drink during the flight.  They do not provide anything to eat, not even a bag of peanuts or a single pretzel on a 4 hour flight. Looking for something to plug your headphones in? Keep looking. No entertainment options whatsoever, not even if you would pay for it. No screen showing your travel stats, no movies, no music, no plug to recharge your electronic, no onboard wifi, no in-cabin skyphone. They don't even have a blanket or pillow on board.   The absolute worst are the seats. Forget regular airplane seats as you know them from other airlines. The seats in a Frontier plane are made of a hard plastic shell with a very thin vinyl cover over it. They have pretty much no cushioning. The back of the seats are not a high as regular seats and sit very upright. They are incredibly uncomfortable. They are kind of curved forward so you remain in a slightly hunched position all the time. I had flown many 12 to 14 hour trips with a number of airlines before. Because of these terrible seats this 4 hours was worse than any other of the much longer flights. The seats are not only terribly uncomfortable, they are also very dangerous for tall people. The seat back is short and ends in the height of my neck. I am 6 foot 6 inches tall and if we had any turbulence I would hit my neck right at the hard upper edge of the seat. No cushioning to soften the blow. If you could choose another airline, even if you had to detour, I would strongly suggest that option. Jetblue and Southwest are pure luxury compare to the Frontier version of travel. Frontier is neither cheap nor a good experience."
,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,IAD to DTW,September 2015,4.0,4.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,9,"There are many horror stories about Frontier Airlines lately, given their recent carry-on baggage charges, new skinny seats, etc. I wanted a good fare for an overnight trip to DTW from the Washington area. The choices? Delta from DCA was over $500. United from IAD the same. Southwest from Baltimore around $300. So I went to the Frontier website, and due to a special sale, I paid a total of $48.00 return, including a charge to select my window seats. The A320 in both direction was clean. Boarding was fine. The seats are indeed thin, but for me the ergonomics worked great and plenty of lower back support. Of course, this is a 55 minute flight one-way, and I only had a backpack. But I would try Frontier again, no question."

We had flown in 2013 with Frontier and were surprised they now charge $30 for one carry on. Also, it seems all the seats have been changed with less padding. Less than an inch of padding in backs and seat, which makes for a very uncomfortable flight. The tray tables are half the size of a normal tray. The staff on the flight were rude and unprofessional. I am anxious on flights, and watch crew a lot. The fight attendants seemed frantic. At one time the co pilot spent 20 min outside the cockpit chatting with a stewardess. Very unprofessional!"
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Denver,September 2015,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"I am incredibly disappointed in Frontier Airlines. Over the last 15 years I've flown numerous times and had never had complaints about them, but this new $30 for a carry on bag? Are you kidding? It has always been a free personal and free carry on bag as it is with many other airlines. There is absolutely no reason to be charging for a carry on bag. And the paying to sit together deal is ridiculous as well. Especially when it takes you through the screen to charge you $25-$30 to choose seats together, and then when I chose no thanks I'll take whatever, it gives me both seats together anyway. So I would have just spent more in stupid bag and seat fees than the ticket cost itself was. Get it together Frontier. You've just lost a long time customer."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Washington DC,September 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier Airlines sent an email describing unreal fares. I bought 2 tickets from Vegas to Washington DC for $75 each. Incredible, right? Wrong. There was no entertainment. Well, ok. The seats didn't recline and the table was smaller than half the size of a laptop. Well, again, for $75 ok. There was no free snacks or drinks. Soda was $2. If you purchased more than 1 seat and wanted to sit next to the other person the cost was between $9-$50 more. When I tried to board for the flight back to Vegas they kicked me out of line and told me I had to pay $60 for my carry-on bag. When I got my receipt for the bag it also included $107 for ""fees and taxes"" and $110 for ""services"". My total bill for my $150 flight ($75x2) was $316. Some of the airline employees that I dealt with were ok but others were unprofessional and rude."

No one could tell us when the flight might leave, so we couldn't leave the gate area but for short periods. No effort was made to book passengers on alternative flights or airlines. They claim not to have partner airlines and I can understand why no one would partner with them. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again and would never recommend Frontier. The worst experience in 30+ years of flying."

As far as the flight attendants were concerned they seemed to do a very good job considering they had to spend more time as sales people than flight service. What bothered us most was we had to pay piecemeal for every item totaling $50.00+ more than another airline. I am unable to sit by the window and noted it in my reservations and was than given a seat next to the window. On the flight back we had to pay so I could get an aisle seat. Then nowhere were we told we would have to pay more for carryon than to check our bags, had we known this we would have combined luggage for one checked bag. Last the seats were hard, did not adjust, no entertainment and the instructions were jammed in as an afterthought. I am sorry to give this kind of report as most often I prefer to complement to complaint."

I luckily did manage to print my boarding pass at a self-checkin machine. At the gate I was told that it would have been possible to put my luggage on the flight simply by bringing it with me through security, although the lady at the counter had told me I couldn't get my bag on the flight anymore. The next day I called customer service for the error that was clearly made on their part. I was handed off from one person to the next and no one was willing to help me. "

You pay extra for carry on's, check-in's, seats, seat changes (even if on accident), food and even drinks except water. They charge you for everything. So there was really no savings at all. Airlines have forgotten the art of good customer service and in the future I will try to avoid Frontier."

The add on fees are basically required for any sort of convenient travel. The customer service is a total joke. I understand that it has been totally outsourced and it is evident from the lack of compassion shows to travelers after my flight was cancelled. I used to be a loyal Frontier traveler with a rewards program membership and credit card. I have since cancelled my card and gifted my several hundred thousand reward miles to friends and family. I actually feel a little guilty for this. Frontier was once my preferred airline of choice, now I'll pay in excess of a $100 premium not to fly them. This is what happens when you quit making your employees and customers a priority."

I was a bit nervous having purchased the ticket as a surprise and not knowing how things would go. However, I must say he was extremely impressed with how well things went. The flight to Tampa was on time and he said the staff was very friendly and helpful. The flight back was also enjoyable, both flights were on time and he felt the staff at both airports as well as the attendants on both flights were friendly. I would recommend."

We were already on the runway, got sent back to the gate to ""fuel up"" again because of a ""reroute"". After an hour, they open up the gate because all of a sudden, there was another technical difficulty (same for first flight) that affected all Frontier airlines nationally. After waiting 6 hours upon arrival, our flight was cancelled. All the passengers marched to the front desk to wait in a line that soon turned into a rally. The employees were poorly equipped to handle scenarios like this. They decided to call the names of 180 passengers individually to hand them their hotel vouchers. They called about 50 names then the front desk agents decided to just abadoned the rest of the customers who were left to find their hotel vouchers with their name. They did tell us before hand that we can book our own hotel and be re-imbursed afterwards. I had no choice but to just book my own."

They nickel and dime you to death. We had to pay extra not only for all luggage but also for our carry-ons. We had to pay to reserve any seat except the ones in the middle. We were traveling with a child but they wouldn't let us reserve seats to ensure that one of us could sit with the child without paying. Even a cup of water cost money on the plane. They were out of the most attractive snack. They told me I had to pay for these things because I booked with Expedia, but I don't think that is true. When I needed help with the boarding passes I got a woman I could hardly understand that I talked to for 45 minutes and she still couldn't tell me how to print the boarding passes. I called again and got somebody who told me in about 7 minutes."
,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to New Orleans,July 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"The ticket price was cheap, and ""you get what you pay for"". From New Orleans to Denver I carried a bag on, after checking in the night before, and choosing to have a random seat instead of paying an extra $13 to choose a seat. The plane was standard with standard seats and tray tables. For the return portion of my round trip ticket, it was a nightmare. These folks are after every penny they can rip you off for. 45 minutes before the take off time, they called anyone who had a carry-on up to the desk, and had not paid while checking in. I was charged $60 for a small bag, and when the 40 or so people in the line complained we were told very abrasively, we could pay or stay on the ground. There was 1 employee trying to handle all the people who would need to pay and only when we collectively complained and asked for a supervisor did they bring another person out. That person was extremely rude, and when I asked for her name she refused to give it. The family behind had checked in at the main Frontier counter, had boarding passes printed for them there, and were not charged for bags. They had to cough up $240 at the counter 20 minutes before flight departure to board the plane. I will never fly this ariline again. I think their tactics are very deceptive."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DCA to DEN,August 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"What was ""tolerable"" travel on Frontier has been reduced to a form of punishment - at every level. The telephone customer service is truly the worst I have encountered - repeatedly. A simple call requires repeating the most basic information many times, only to be put on hold many times, and asked the same questions. The reps have a script that they know how to read, but beyond that, there is no actual problem solving going on. They speak English, but comprehension is lacking. I don't need to check luggage, but I end up paying another $80 for seats and luggage on top of a not so great fare. The inflight experience is another worst in US travel. A broken plastic lawn chair would provide greater comfort than the new rigid, horribly uncomfortable seats that do not recline (unless you pay another $100 round trip (or pay to bundle) for one of the 18 ""stretch"" seats in the first 3 rows. The web site frequently has issues. The flight crew - no complaints, no compliments. They're no different than any other airline, which is to say they tolerate us passengers. "
,,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Denver,August 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"I used to like Frontier, and I would pick it over higher cost carriers. They had comfortable seats, their staff were pleasant and helpful, and I never had a problem with them. Then I flew them this weekend. It was the worst flying experience I have had. They charge you for everything, your seat, carry on luggage, a coke. We easily spent a couple of hundred dollars over the ticket price, so their ""low cost"" ticket turned out to be pretty expensive. Secondly, the seats are now just a frame with cheap plastic slung across it - it's very uncomfortable, they are packed in there, and you can't even recline. Thirdly, it's poorly run. At the airport, we had to wait in line for a half hour at the ticket counter, even though we had already checked in online and were just dropping off a bag. In short, pick any other airline-it will be cheaper in the end and you'll have a better experience."
,A319,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,August 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"Absolutely horrible. The seats are unbearable. No padding and they do not recline, they squeezed in two extra rows of seats at the cost of customer comfort and the seats are comparable to a city bus. The seat back is less than 2 inches thick of molded plastic covered with 1/4 foam and material. I would have paid double instead of being on that flight."
,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Denver,August 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Awful. I cannot possibly list everything bad about this airline. Buying tickets is a pain because it is almost impossible to figure out exactly what the trip will cost. Redesigned cabin seats are horrible. Hard plastic with minimal padding. Staff is completely unwilling to help you out. Frontier management believes this model is what customers want. Comfort, pleasant staff and simple amenities are not important. Flying is hard enough. Frontier does everything they can to make it even worse. Avoid."

Frontier has 2 lines, one for check-in and one for bag drop for online check in passengers. The kiosks were located in the front of the check in line meaning you still have to wait in the check-in line to use those (so much for saving time by skipping the line). I went through the usual security and onward to Houston George Bush Intl Airport Terminal A, nothing special there except the fact that the gate Frontier was to depart from (Gate A25) was horrendously crowded and so I had to resort sitting on the other side of the terminal. Boarding commenced at 3.05pm and I was welcomed onboard by a very enthusiastic and welcoming flight attendent, and went towards the back portion of the aircraft where I was shown to my seat. The seat itself was ok, it was the older dark green-black leather seats with the T Vs and full tray tables, they could recline but barely, but the headrest was pretty comfortable. The usual takeoff proceeded, I wanted to change seats as a gendtlemen talked onward endlessly and was spitting on my arm for over an hour, I went to a flight attendant and asked for a seat change and  I was relocated towards the front of the aircraft. I was pleasantly pleased with the enthusiasm of all 3 crews."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver via Cincinnati,August 2015,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier happened to have a cheaper fare for my Atlanta - Denver flight. I arrived at the airport just over an hour before my flight which was very early in the morning. I had no bags to check and I figured it would be a brief swipe at the kiosk and I'd be on my way. I had no idea that Frontier has a 45 minute cut-off where they refuse to print boarding passes after that time, forcing you to miss your flight. The kiosk refused my information and wouldn't let me check in. I waited in line and watched the 45 minute timeline arrive and pass. By the time I got to the counter they refused to give me my boarding pass and suggested that I book the next flight at 8:10am. Frustrated, I called the airline with the number provided by the staff and was told it would be $100 to move me to the next flight, plus Frontier charges a $40 carry on fee? I'm used to paying $25 for my checked bag with Delta, which is why I made the effort to do only carry-on luggage this trip. I moved back over to the counter where there was no line and asked for my boarding pass. It was 1 hour before the flight. The staff told me the 45 minute window had closed again. Patiently, I told them I had gotten off the phone seconds ago and the woman told me that it was still ""open"" and that they could print my boarding pass. I also alerted them to the actual time. ""Oh"" was the response! Do they have any clue the extent of the inconvenience they cause by simply not using their few active brain cells? They printed my boarding pass - never once mentioning that my original flight had been delayed to 8:45 - thereby saving me $100 and the stress and hassle of dealing with their ineptitude. Their flight attendants are sweet and I have nothing bad to say about them, but the staff that book flights and checks people is a study in illiteracy. I have never been so frustrated with an airline in my life. I've never written a scathing review on anything before now! Sorry Frontier, but you've lost my business. Your nickel-and-dime antics and lack of service will eventually earn you what you deserve. "

Representatives behind the counter were disinterested and refused to help. Seats were painfully uncomfortable for a 5 hour flight. Return flight paid the extra $50 per ticket for upgraded seats (Padded, reclining, and extra leg room). Got on the plane and found out the seats had extra leg room but were not padded and did not recline, another painful flight. Called for refund and was offered 50% back in vouchers.

This is the worst possible air carrier you could fly, pay the extra money and take another carrier. Frontier lost our bag in the midst of our best friends wedding, the staff at Denver were horrible and unhelpful. The phone numbers after 5 pm do not work. If you want your luggage lost and poor customer service, this is the air service you would want to choose. I was on the phone with them for about 4 hrs and they transferred me from person to person with no resolution. At the end of the day we never received our luggage. "

Outbound - we were about to depart MSP when they started counting and recounting everyone. An hour later they were still counting passengers. Finally told they had a security issue and started checking off everyone's name on the flight. We ended up taking off 2 hours and 15 mins late! On the way return we got to the airport and were told our flight would be 3 hours and 10 mins late. Then told it will be 2 hours 55 mins late, left us waiting in a very small and cramped departure area with no food."

If you elect to not pay, the system chooses for you. Baggage fees: Many so-called low cost airlines now charge baggage fees for carry-on bags, however, it is as if Frontier has a scam to collect extra baggage fees. At no point in the process was it apparent there is a fee for carry-on baggage. I checked-in online and paid checked-bag fees, I did not see anything about fees for carry-on bags. At the check-in desk, the agent said nothing about carry-on bag fees. At the gate I was forced to pay $60 for a small carry-on bag. I was one of at least 6 other passengers who learned this at the gate, all of us were surprised and appalled about the lack of information on this fee. The gate agent told me they aren't req'd to inform passengers about the fee at check-in. He said the cost is $25 if paid online, $40 if paid at the check-in desk, $60 if paid at the gate. If I had known this, I would not have had a carry-on bag. We were 3 passengers with 2 checked bags and 1 small carry-on bag. If we had taken 3 carry-ons, I would have had to pay $180 dollars at the gate. Also, the seats were terrible, and the service reps were cold and uninformative. Last trip with Frontier. "
,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Miami,July 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"Frontier Airlines say their seats don't recline, but Row 13 is the only row where the seats do recline on their A319. I was seated on row 14 and as soon as the flight departed Denver (Flt 612 on July 26), the three people in front of me recline their seats and laughed loudly that they paid $50 more for a first class seats. Row 13 is an exit row. It made the overnight flight very uncomfortable for me since my seat did not recline and my knees were firmly pressed up against the seat in front of me for 3.5 hours. During the beverage service, the flights attendant approached each person saying, ""would you like to purchase a cocktail, soft drink, or snack"". I ordered a water and was surprised to hear her serving wine to the person directly behind me. I looked up at her and said excuse me and she just said, ""I'll be right with you"" with a bit of an attitude. I guess if I paid $4 for the water I would have been served before the person behind me. When you add up the flight, extra costs ($3 for a seat selection, $25 for a carry-on bag, $30 for a checked bag, and $4 for a soda or $6.99 for a beer), I really didn't save anything by flying Frontier. I am most surprised that Frontier apparently charges $50 more for Row 13. It seems very unfair the only row that reclines is Row 13 and anyone seated on Row 14 gets a seat back in there face. I gave it a try, but I will not make that mistake again. Frontier may be a discount carrier, but they are not the cheapest once you start adding in all the extras. Buyer beware."

Our return flight was scheduled 6am on 6/30/2015, flight 917 from Trenton to Orlando. We started to board on time but were told to return to the terminal due to a mechanical problem. After waiting three hours with little information from Frontier staff we were told our flight was cancelled!Two staff members from Frontier Airlines were at the gate passing out letters stating Frontier airlines would reimburse passengers up to four hundred dollars for another flight and assist with accommodations so passengers could complete their travel. There was no one from Frontier to assist with anything! Due to the fourth of July holiday we were unable to get on another flight for several days.

Mother is elderly, so had I not checked her boarding pass, she would have ended up goodness knows where. Secondly, when I arrive in CLT my bag did not arrive with me! No apology, nothing! The rep calls me the next day (July 5th) to tell me the bag had arrived and I should go get it. Of course, it was too late for that being that I was scheduled to return to PHL on Tuesday 7/7.

The seats directly in front of the exit row will not recline backwards, so on a late night 4-hour flight, I had to sleep in an upright position. It was very uncomfortable. You can ask for a cup of Frontier's very fine water on ice and they will give it to you at no additional charge. "
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Austin,June 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,Second delay in 4 days. First delay 4.5 hours. Second delay was going home. One hour and still waiting! Both due to mechanical issues. Bags took 30 minutes to get bags at baggage claim.
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to PDX via DEN,June 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,4.0,2,no,1,"I understood that Frontier was a low cost airline and that many ""extras"" had additional fees associated with them. What I didn't realize was that if you paid the fees, they would not provide the service you paid for. I chose to pay the extra fees for seat selection so that my party could sit together and my children would not have to sit next to a stranger. I booked 8 seats and chose the seats from Frontier's seat selection menu. When we arrived at the airport, the seats had been changed and we were no longer seated as a group. The agent told me there was nothing they could do about it since our seats had already been assigned to someone else. So, we were split up on our flight. I was told that not only could we not sit together, they had no power to refund the seat selection fees that had already been paid. I would have to call and talk with ""Customer Relations."" I have now made 3 phone calls to customer relations and spent a total of 2.5 hours on the phone. Again I am told that ""customer relations is working on it"". I waited and again, no call back. "
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to LaGuardia ,June 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"I checked into the airport 5am on the 11th June. I'm a wheelchair passenger. I was told someone would be with me shortly. I sat for almost an hour waiting. Finally a lady told me they were short staffed so I would have to wait so I waited. My flight left for New York at 6.15, I barely made my flight and I was the last one on the plane. My flight on the other hand was ok. Would fly with Frontier Airline as long as I'm not in a wheelchair."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,DFW to SLC,April 2015,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Frontier is no different from other US based airlines. Same lower quality interiors, comfort, poorer service and lack of respect for economy class passengers. Frontier goes a step forward and uses the following tactics to foster its revenues: 1) Bait and switch schedules. 2) Nickel and dime everything from seat selection, food, beverages, and carry on bags. My family booked a flight back in January for a journey in April. We thought we got a good price and a schedule that fit our needs. Few weeks later we were contacted by our travel agent to inform us that Frontier had canceled the return flight. We were offered the following choices: 1) Go on a flight the following day - Frontier would not compensate for any added expenses. 2) Cancel for no charge and rebook on another airline for an additional $400, because tickets prices had increased in the interim. We were pretty much forced to go with option 1. Also, while doing an online check-in the Frontier system pretty much ""confuses"" you into paying unnecessary fees. We had the foresight to skip that process during seat selection, whereby it automatically assigned us a seat without additional fees. We were not so lucky as it suckered us to pay cabin baggage fees that no one bothered to check at the gates and smarter passengers had avoided. Essentially the system threatens you will be charged more at the gate and that you are better of paying online. I'd take my chances at the gate. "
,,Business,Economy Class,DIA to CUN,June 2015,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"If you're traveling for business, or travel where you need travel to be on time and reliable don't fly Frontier Airlines. My wife and I made the mistake of booking Frontier Airlines for our honeymoon. We had our flight information changed 3 times. They changed the whole day of travel, causing us to have to reschedule our motel, they changed times on us and then on the week of my wedding when we had enough other things going on they changed our flight times just a few days before we left. I called to ask them about this and they offered no explanation.  I can't imagine using them again when I need a reliable flight."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington-Dulles to Orlando International,June 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"I compared Frontier with other airlines before purchasing my ticket. I paid $253 for a round-trip ticket from Washington-Dulles to Orland- which included upcharges for a seats $40 ($20 each way) and a checked bag fee of $50 ($25 each way). I checked in and boarded without a problem. The seats are incredibly thin and hard.  I was in row 6 and the seats don't recline. There are no TVs in the headrest and no inflight entertainment. I arrived to the airport for the flight back extremely early as the rest of my family was driving back and Frontier only has only one flight departing Orlando at 8:40PM. Around 8, I was texting my parents in DC and they told me they lost power because of a storm. There was no agent at the gate to tell us the status of our flight. At 8:30 there was still no gate agent. Then with no announcement and no gate agent present, the flight went from saying ""on time"" to 11:40PM. People started to get panicky. A little after 9PM finally a gate agent comes up and gets on the loud speaker and says ""Your flight has been cancelled, please see an agent to rebook your flight."" I went back to check-in and the agents were confused. ""We didn't know the flight was cancelled. We're just finding out like you. You need to call customer service.""  Since there is only one departing flight per day, I knew the rebooking situation would be bleak. So, I decided to get a hotel room rather than spend 24hrs in the airport. It was after 10PM before I checked in. I then spent over an hour on the phone with customer service, who rebooked me on the 8:40PM flight for the following night. But the thought of spending another 10hrs+ in the airport literally brought me to tears. So I booked a one-way ticket on US Airways to DCA. Attempting to save $100, ended up costing me more than $340 - not to mention meals while I was waiting. In the end Frontier credited me $56 to use on a future fare, which I will never use because I'm never flying with them again."
,A319,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,TPA to CLE,June 2015,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,3,no,4,"First time on Frontier, Tampa to Cleveland. Went ""Classic"" which included free bag check-in, assigned seat (in ""Stretch Seating"", aisles 1-4), and Zone 1 boarding. Inbound aircraft was late. The other plane at TPA due for DEN was 3 hours late to properly rest the crew (obviously late the night before inbound). The one good thing were the seats, very comfortable and in dark green leather, with plenty of leg room, at least in the ""Stretch"" area. Cabin service was mediocre, $4.49 for an oversized Rice Crispie treat and a cup of coffee (and the stewardess had forgotten the coffee, granted a mistake, until being reminded, and she was very apologetic about it). Timekeeping is a problem at Frontier, this seems to be a regular thing. Would only fly them non-stop, and have contingency plans at the ready."
,,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,June 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"I have never written a review, much less a negative one, before. Frontier used to be a great airline from start to finish. Found out they were bought by Spirit, considered the rock bottom airline. I was careful to pick a good connecting airline considering baggage rates. I was gouged at check in with my large purse fee. Frontier has clearly taken on Spirit's m.o.'s. "
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Orlando via Denver / Chicago,June 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"Horrible customer service, horrible planes. I was flying from San Francisco to Orlando with a layover in Denver (at least that's what it said on our itinerary email). We're then told there's actually two stops, one in Denver, one in Chicago. The flight from Denver to Chicago was 2 hours late. Then we sat for an hour on the tarmac. Then we arrive at Chicago and they tell us our flight to Orlando left 3 hours ago - they knew they were sending us to Chicago when the last flight to Orlando had already left. There were no apologies issued at any point, they just kept insisting that it was due to weather. Then of course they did not offer any refund, or partial refund, credits, nothing. The employees ""helping"" us get out of this fiasco were rude. They kept telling us there were no more flights until Wednesday (this was taking place on Monday). Other passengers started just booking flights on other airlines and when most of them had disappeared they actually started helping us. We got a direct flight to Orlando 17 hours later and had to fly back to Denver first. Horrible experience."

Our flight to Denver (due out at 7.50pm) was cancelled. Option to transfer to another airline flying to Denver? Nope (not unless we pay). Complimentary hotel due to the fact that we are now Stuck in New Orleans overnight? Nope. Complimentary meal tickets? Nope. Flight out in the morning? Nope. Refund? No-one was forthcoming on that so I still don't know if that was an option. Rescheduled on another flight almost 24hrs later, lets hope it's not delayed or cancelled"
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Denver,June 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Encountered the worst customer service with Frontier. From the desk agents who stood around for 20 minutes and then claimed we came in late to the customer support, they all were rude and unfriendly and offered absolutely no support to help get us home in time. They lure you in with cheap tickets and then charge ridiculous for everything, and by the time all is said and done, you spend more then you would have to just fly Southwest or something. Will never consider flying with Frontier, and suggest the same to everyone who doesn't want to get a headache from something as simple as flying A to B."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to New Orleans,,5.0,5.0,,,,,5,yes,8,"One way flight from Atlanta to New Orleans. Was very worried after booking and reading so many bad reviews. Flight was delayed almost 2 hours due to a storm but we were well informed with updates by staff in waiting area. When I got on board I was pleasantly surprised with the leather, or what appeared to be leather, seats and they were very comfortable. The flight staff were very attentive and the flight was smooth as glass. So I'm glad I had what seems to be one of the rare good flights. No problems except for the delay. Would have spent way more money driving down and didn't have that long drive. I'm satisfied!"
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Cleveland,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Frontier has officially landed at the absolute bottom of the airlines.  Planes have recently been ""remodelled"" to include hard plastic seats that don't recline and tray tables that are the width of a cup.  On our last flight from Las Vegas to Cleveland, we arrived early (big mistake).  Ours may have been the only boarding passes printed with the wrong gate.  When we finally realized it, the plane was pulling away from the gate.  No announcement or email message (but they can bombard me with ads on my email account).  Next plane was nine hours later (overnight).  And to add insult to injury, charged us a $75 per person change fee.  No offer to food or hotel or alternate airline.  Just tough luck.
"
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,,2,no,1,"Sure, you might expect that when booking with an ""ultra low fare"" airline that it will be skimpy. Come on, though. Charging for a carry on? Does the airline actually think people travel with only a purse or briefcase? Of course not. Just add $35 to the price of the ticket. And for coffee? The flight attendant actually told me that one cup pays for the whole pot. That piece of data is not surprising, but the fact that she told me only reinforced my observation that the majority of the staff of Frontier display an embarrassed, apologetic demeanour. I would too. There is just no room for this type of nickel and dime approach in a competitive space. Cheers to Southwest for not going this direction. At some point Frontier will run out of first time fliers to fool with their supposed lower rates. Then, everyone will have made the same decision I have made: never fly them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I had to plan a cheap trip from Texas to Delaware. I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to get through security and get to my gate however the line to get my ticket from Frontiers desk at IAH was long. No one was at the front because it is their policy at IAH to not take customers until two hours before the next flight. When I finally got my ticket I found out I had to pay an additional $35 to carry my suitcase on the plane because the ticket prices do not include carry ons. I guess Frontier thinks people that travel do not need to take anything with them. Then I had to get through security which the lines were long. By the time I got to my gate the plane was already boarding. My return flight I had to pay another additional $35 for my carry on. My total price for my ticket went up by $70. If I had known that I would have gotten a ticket through Delta or US Airlines. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"Flight 506. Denver to LaGuardia May 15th. Don't fly frontier! The arm rest has been reduced to less than an inch in width the seats are plastic without any comfort and they don't even recline. The tray table is only 4"" in depth which I guess is all you need for the extra small cup of water you get which is the only complimentary beverage. No snacks no inflight TV no business or first class and actually no class whatsoever. For a 3.5 hour flight to the east coast it was miserable."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,F9 916 5/31/15 and F9 1287 6/1/15. The seats were uncomfortable my seat woul not recline and it was hard as a rock. The hidden charges made the flight overly expensive added 90 dollars to my trip each way for seat choice and small bag carry-on. The service was terrible and no one around to answer questions at the Chicago airport. I ordered a Chardonnay off the menu and it came in a can with a gorilla face on it marked white wine and it had bubbles in it I took one sip and could not drink the rest it was horrible a waste of $7. None of the attendants or counter people were friendly or helpful. I usually fly Southwest and hope I never have to fly frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,,5 hour delay coming from Miami Fl to Denver Co on June 2nd 2015. No complementary anything was offered. Worst planes. Now the seats are very small the tray in front of you only hold 2 cups. My last time flying with Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,First time flying with them and my last. I was flying from Atlanta to Orlando could not check in online. Kiosks were not working so I stood in line to check in and the attendant gave me attitude for coming to the desk. The airline gave me the incorrect gate number and once I figured out which gate I needed to go to the airline changed it and we had to move - very unorganized. Once they found a gate for us the plane was delayed 2 hours for mechanical issues. No one informed passengers of the delay. I wouldn't have know except that my smart phone informed me. After waiting 2 hours we boarded sat for 30 more minutes before going out to the runway. Once there we were told the plane still had problems so back to the gate we want where we were taken off the plane. I gave up and went home as I am not getting on a broken plane with such unorganized and rude staff. The plane was supposed to depart at 12:15 it is now 6.30 and it still hasn't left Atlanta. I will never fly with them again. Very unprofessional staff.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,I had a flight from Miami to Washington Dulles with Frontier. When I searched on google I was a little worried when I booked this flight since the price was only half compared to those of other airlines (even after adding the baggage fee). But nothing was wrong. Perfect flight. Take off and landing on time. Check-in fast. Baggage fast. I have nothing to complain. That they charge for the baggage and the food is quite normal in my opinion. The prices for those services are reasonable. If you accept the cheap airplane tickets they provide that is part of the additional costs one has to accept too. Anyway highly recommend!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My fiancé and I flew from Portland Or to Memphis TN. My first slight shock came when it was apparent that we had to pay for drinks which on every other airline I have flown this was complementary. It also seemed that anything extra had a cost to it. But my biggest complaint was when we were returning home. Our flight was delayed an hour. No announcement was made to the passengers or any explanation was given. When we boarded we waited another half hour to take off due to computer issues. We ended up missing our connecting flight to our home city. It took the customer service reps two hours to give us our stand by tickets and food vouchers. They also were unsure about how the hotel voucher worked. Speaking of hotel they didn't have any rooms in their system for us so the voucher was pretty much pointless. So as a well traveled person I would not recommend this airline to anyone no matter how cheap they are.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,1,no,,This was by far the worst travel experience. I flew from ATL to PDX with a connection in Denver. Our flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours and we spent an additional hour on the runway because Frontier was short staffed and could not find anyone to direct the flight out. We were told that our connecting flight was aware of the delay and waiting at the gate for us. Little did we know they rebooked the entire flight before we even departed from Atlanta with no intention of holding the plane. When we arrived there was no gate available and 20 passengers missed their connecting flight. Frontier customer service was extremely rude. They did not offer any vouchers and told customers that all hotels were booked and passengers would have to remain in the airport for up to 2 days. There were elderly and sickly people scattered all over the airport sleeping on floors and chairs. One family had to purchase 6 new tickets on Delta airlines because Frontier did not have a flight to put them on for 2 whole days. Although airfare appears reasonable please keep in mind that there is a seating fee for up to $35. Both carry on bags and checked bags cost between $25-$35. Water is free but all other beverages cost $2.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,We boarded Frontier flight 607 from Miami on 5/15/15 at 1.08pm. We watched the flight land and unload and within 5 mins we boarded the plane. After everyone boarded this was a full flight the door was shut the captain came on and stated we had to have a tyre change. After over an hour the captain came back on and said we needed to have a 2nd tyre changed. We spent from 1.08pm until 3.40pm on this plane before takeoff on a fully booked airbus shoulder to shoulder very uncomfortable seats and without a single offering of a drink or food item. While I appreciate and understand safety this is absolutely uncalled for! The very least they could have offered was a complimentary drink but no we had to pay $2 for a canned soda. We spent a total of 4 hours on this plane! The seats on Frontier are plastic and very uncomfortable! They also state they are committed to serving customers but that is not what we experienced on this flight. Customer service is lacking.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,I took Frontier from LAX to DEN to DWT. In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,I took Frontier Airlines from Houston IAH to San Francisco SFO on Saturday May 2nd and returned on Wednesday May 6th. The airline gives complimentary water and was punctual to the destinations. Had no issues with luggage nor seating.
,,,,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I flew Frontier from SFO-MSY. I had to pay for seats on both flights totalling $70 plus a checked bag fee for both flights totalling $40. On top of a $500 ticket it cost me $110 extra just to get a seat and to check one bag. All the drinks and food on the plane are extra. On top of that when I arrived in New Orleans only half of the passengers received their checked luggage. The rest of us waited over an hour for someone to help us and after that they found our bags in the back of the baggage claim where someone forgot to put them on the carousel. Today (5/7/15) I get to the airport for my return trip - everyone was ready to board when someone comes out at the gate to tell us that our flight was delayed for four hours because Frontier didn't have a crew for the flight. The woman who made the announcement quickly walked away leaving all the passengers standing in disbelief. I go to the ticket counter to have them find a flight from Denver to San Francisco because I was going to miss my connection. I was put on hold 45 minutes and talked to four different people.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,I've been flying Frontier between Dulles and Orlando on a regular basis (once or twice a month) since they started the service last summer. They are having scheduling issues flights are late 70-80% of the time. They charge for everything since I have no luggage only a computer bag that's ok. I reserve a seat since I don't want a middle one and that recently went from $3 to $8. All this is ok for a two hour flight (beats driving) except that the plane I have been flying on lately has the thinnest most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on in an airplane. Not sure if this is an exception or this is the new normal? Overall they're ok and the flight delays are becoming shorter and less frequent.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,yes,8,My family and I flew round-trip from Cleveland to Orlando and I am happy to report that we had great experiences on both flights. All Frontier airport staff/flight attendants were very friendly. Neither flight was delayed at all in fact we reached our destination ahead of schedule both times. I will say that we were annoyed by the extra charges for choosing seats (which I did because one of my companions is a very nervous flyer and I didn't want her to be alone) and carry-on bags (which again we did - checking bags is the cheaper option but I prefer the ease of carry-on luggage whenever possible) however getting to/from our destination safely and efficiently is top priority. I would certainly recommend Frontier to others but just make sure you look into all the charges before you book so you know what's coming.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Denver to Dallas 4/22 flight 124 and from Houston to Denver 4/26 flight 247. I fly Frontier all of the time out of Denver and have never had any issues at all. One of the few carriers to have TVs on every flight. I have never been delayed. It blows my mind that there are so any bad reviews. You just bought an airline ticket for 100's under other carriers and you don't expect to be charged other places? It's not even that terrible of up charges. Yes to pick your seat if you want to and to check or carryon a bag but you still are 100's under other carriers prices. Go into knowing there will be fees it's nowhere near as bad as spirits fees and the prices are cheaper. The planes are nicer and the pilots are top notch.
,,,,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew at the end of April 2015 from CVG-LAS round-trip. First experience on Frontier. I had researched pretty well so I knew all about the extra fees. I paid in advance for a checked bag and an upgraded stretch seat. Seat was very average at best but on a long flight the leg space was worth it. It was my first time checking a bag in years as I couldn't justify spending more to carry my bag on. A bit of a hassle but probably would not stop me from flying them again. Flights were on time and went off without complication. They really hustle to turn the planes around quickly. That also means that they don't get cleaned very well as this is the flight crews job. Floor of the plane was filthy and general upkeep was neglected. Definitely no frills but they did get me and my luggage from point A to point B safely and on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Always remember that you get what you pay for. This airline lures you with low fares then has lots of add ons. $35 for a carry on #25 for a checked back and also you have to pay to select a seat. Minimal staffing at airport so unable to answer questions. Flight from DEN-LAS delayed 4 hours due to mechanical delay no support from airport staff. Return flight boarded 45 min early with final call 30 min before scheduled departure because they wanted to leave early. Worst turbulence ever on approach into DEN never had with other airlines even in bad weather. Would not recommend. Crew not particularly friendly.
,,,,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"I have been a ""road warrior"" for over 15 years. My schedule for weekly air travel has been fairly consistent throughout that time-I'm usually on a plane every week. Needless to say I have pretty much flown every airline out there. When we moved to Denver 4 years ago Frontier became my ""go to"" airline. Great staff great service lots of direct flights and they were usually on-time. Wow with the new ownership and pricing model apparently you can kiss all of that goodbye! Sad to say that the best air carrier has completely imploded. Stay away. Do not buy into the cheap airfare inducement."
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"Worst experience on an airline ever for this frequent traveler. Due to mechanical failure on the aircraft they left us stranded in Orlando in early March. They kept us at bay until they boarded three other flights in their terminal ""pod"" I suppose to thin the crowd that could have got fired up. 5 hours after scheduled departure they told us flight cancelled. They were working on getting hotel accommodations and transportation but could not tell us about return flight info. It was approaching midnight and I had to be back home in the AM. We booked a flight on US Airways who as always took great care of us. We spent the night on the floor in the airport. They do not respond to complaints nor have they made any effort towards remedying their failure. Horrible customer service. Horrible airline."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,I took a 5 hour flight from Dulles to Vegas. I wasn't sitting with my boyfriend who I booked the flight with. We were delayed nearly 2 hours. The seats were like sitting on a rock and my seat recline was broken. To watch TV was 5.99 to get a soda was 2.99! On the way home we got to sit together but there weren't any TVs and none of the seats reclined. The flight home boarded a hour early and took off early which those of us who were there appreciated but a lot of people got left behind. I will go back to flying with Delta!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight F9 1256 4/15/15. I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus. Expect to get from point A to point B nothing more. Plan on bringing a pillow and a book to make the flight more comfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,March 15 flight #1127. March 20 flight #1126. I booked flights with Frontier Airlines before knowing anything about the airline. My husband researched them and had us very nervous about flying with them due to reports of cancelled and late flights. I called customer service and they were very helpful and courteous. After talking with them I felt comfortable with the reservations. The flight out of Dulles was 30 minutes late but we still arrived in Las Vegas 15 minutes early. On the return flight we left 15 minutes late and arrived at Dulles 45 minutes early. I have no complaints at all.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,Denver to Seattle April 8 2015 flt 137. Seattle to Denver April 12 2015 flt 146. The seats were uncomfortable and leg room was not sufficient. The extra carry on bag fee was $40.00 and cokes were about $3. Terrible experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,The only thing that had any value was my seat and I was by the emergency window. I had great leg space but as for the service on the flight. The flight attendant seemed she didn't really care no smile. As for the pricing it was a cheap flight but everything else cost: the drinks (non-alcohol) on the flight and the snacks. The bags I got charged for every bag. I will not fly Frontier just like I have not flown Alaska Airlines.
,,,,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Been flying from Orlando to Washington Dulles every week since June their inaugural flight. Never saw such a decline in service. Upgraded seats went. From 25 to 45$. Seats went from a nice leather to a hard smaller seat that does not even recline. Just cram more seats. No leg room. Seven out of ten flights are always delayed. I have three more flights then going back to another airlines. Would rather pay more. Actually everything Frontier charges for it is cheaper to fly elsewhere.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,1,"I am laying on the terminal floor as I type this. I was scheduled to fly to ORD from MCO this evening at 6.45. There were heavy storms in the Midwest so our flight was initially delayed. This happens. However the way this airline handled this delay was nothing short of appalling. The website said the flight would be delayed a little less than an hour. Upon arrival at the gate there is absolutely no info on out flight. Finally after 3 hrs the young woman at the gate tells us that the flight should get to Orlando around 12.15am and that's ""all she knows"". We all wait. Meanwhile the skies are all clear in Chicago and all other flights are starting to get moving. Then at about 11pm we are told that the plane has not yet pushed back in Chicago and is sitting at the gate and now the flight will be around 2:45am. At this point we all start to ask if the flight will be cancelled so we can all make other arrangements and find lodging. The attendant once again says that this is all the info she has. One man asks ""you work for the airline can't you at least call to see if you can find anything out?"" Her response ""no I can't."" She eventually disappears. Then shortly after midnight a man get on the intercom and informs us (very casually) that the flight is cancelled but ""since it has do to with weather we aren't going to make any accommodations for anyone. If you want we can give you s number that you can call to try and figure this out fit yourselves."" They preceded to write down the same 800 number from the website on ripped pieces of paper and hand it out to anyone who asked. In defence of the attendants they seemed like they honestly had no idea what was going on and were just as frustrated as many of the passengers. Upon calling the airline I was put on hold for over 45 mins with no response. All in all it was an awful experience and the incompetence of this airline seemingly knows no bounds. I am currently stuck in Orlando with a choice of paying over $700 for a one way domestic flight or renting a car and driving 20hrs to get home because this airline cancelled my flight and offered no solution or assistance whatsoever. I will never fly Frontier again!"
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,Even though we enjoyed the convenience of the 5 minutes walk between our parking spot and the check-in counter at Trenton Airport having to pay for any checked luggage and specific seats so my partner and I could seat side by side was vexatious. Flight attendants were very pleasant but the 2-hour wait after disembarking at Hartsfield- Jackson (Atlanta) to get our checked luggage was exasperating.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,0,no,1,"Flight was delayed on my way to Naples FL from Cleveland OH. No notification and no staff around. Finally 1 hour later we were told there wasn't staff for our plane. On my way back home my seat was double sold! Tried to offer me another seat but it was away from my daughter whom I was flying with. Staff were difficult just said ""you want to get home don't you""? Then to top it off my luggage was lost! How does that happen on a non-stop flight?"
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,"Bad service. Paid for seat upgrade but video monitor did not work. Every seat except middle seats behind the wing have an upgrade fee. Beverage service is poor at best and even a Coke costs $3 (""but you get the whole can""). Bag fees are increasing yet again. As a Denver native I am sad to say I will never fly Frontier again and will discourage anybody else from doing so. Like with Spirit Air Indigo Partners ruined another once great airline. But hey they turn the biggest profit in the industry so screw the passengers."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I did not have any baggage to check and my only carry-on was a backpack that fit under the seat. I arrived at SeaTac in plenty of time for my flight so that I could print out my boarding pass (I had already checked in online) only to find that none of the kiosks were working. So I waited over an hour for the counter to open only to be treated to a rep yelling at everyone for not checking in at the kiosk. Finally the other rep got her to listen that the kiosks didn't work. Upon arrival at the airport my flight was listed as on time. After a gate change to clear across the airport we were told that the flight was delayed by 4.5 hours. No one to speak with since no agents at the gate. By 10pm 3 hours post original flight time the flight was listed as delayed another 3 hours! Again no agents to speak with. I had signed up for text/phone/email notifications and none were ever received. We ended up arriving 8 hours after our arrival time. I had to take another day off of work and it was a very long night. The flight crew was pleasant but again no compensation of any kind for our troubles. You would think that if Frontier cared at all about their passengers that we could at least get a free soda. This was my last Frontier flight! Not worth the time and aggravation. We never did get a realistic reason for the delay.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,,Will never fly Frontier Airlines again. We were scheduled to fly to Tucson via Milwaukee to Denver to Tucson. When checking in in Milwaukee we were told our outbound Milwaukee to Denver flight was delayed by two hours. As a result we would miss our Denver to Tucson flight. For the next 75 minutes we waited to be rebooked on a flight arriving in Tucson 24 hours later. Terrible service. No apologies nothing. You get what you pay for with this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,Frontier Airlines is ranked as a 3 star carrier. Really? On a scale of 1 to 5 stars 3 stars means an airline is average. That has not been my experience on Frontier and I think on a whole the airline is substandard. My recent flight round-trip from PDX to DEN was miserable. They charge for baggage-checked and carry on and they even charge for a cup of coffee or soda! The flight attendants are grumpy and not customer service oriented flights are late without any reason or apologies from the ground crew and leg room is non-existent. Better fares abound on Southwest so choose wisely.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I bought my tickets before reading the reviews and when I started to read the reviews I started to regret buying the cheap tickets but it was too late. I flew from Orlando back to Chicago and I have to really say that I'm glad I bought the tickets before reading the reviews or I wouldn't have bought them. High points of the flight? They have a TV and the seats were actually comfortable. I'm a plus size girl and I fit and my legs didn't feel cramped at all. So for those of you who had a bad experience try it again maybe it was a bad day for everyone that day. But do bring your own snacks and drink because the prices are ridiculous onboard.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,The customer service is unacceptable and unhelpful and the flights are frequently delayed and canceled. This airline will tempt you with lower fares and then make you pay for each carry-on bag and each checked bag as well. It's a tactic that has apparently been working for them because their buyers are ignorant and don't check these things first so please don't be one of those customers like I was. My only advice is turn around and book somewhere else.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"I have been a summit member for over ten years. They have methodically reduced all of the benefits for being a frequent flier until they are now nearly non-existent. The staff on the phone when you can get through are tired and it is easy to see that they very much dislike their jobs. The flight attendants on too many of my recent flights are also grumbling and service is sketchy at best. On a recent flight from Denver going south the attendants did not start the beverage service until we were more than two thirds the way to the destination and did not prepare the cabin for landing until the pilot announced ""Attendants please prepare for landing."" Speaking with a number of people we have all encountered hang-ups when trying to speak to an agent."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,The usual complaint about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. We packed individually a total of four carry on for a total of $200 round trip and we had to checked them not bring as carry on. Second they changed our returning flight from 11pm to 9am we lost a day of our vacation! Then we had to purchase assigned seats to ensure we sit together. Third they only provide free water everything else had to pay even $3.00 for a can of soda. Only snacks for a 7 hour flight to Las Vegas. Fourth staff did not communicate we had special service stop in Cincinnati and we're told to get out of the plane and then they called us in about 5 minutes to hurry up that we should have never got out of the plane. Six our returning flight was awful we sit inside the airplane for an hour they said it was a light bulb they needed to change. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'3 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour. Seven we had to get out of airplane in Cleveland Ohio for special service again and only had 10 minutes to purchase cold food and drinks for $60. Insane! And then ran back to the same airplane. Eight we finally arrived to Orlando Florida the staff could not tell us were the luggage will be. After we arrived to baggage claim we waited for over an hour! Nine a lot of passengers went to the counter where staff had no idea why the luggage was not available they said that probably they were waiting for other flights! Finally a supervisor came in and her only consolation comment was that we needed to wait 5 more minutes. Everyone was outraged and started asking for their baggage money back. The frontier supervisor started yelling back to all passengers and threat to call police on us. No meal voucher or baggage voucher. We had just keep waiting after a 12 hour trip. Ten this was the worst experience I've had. The cheap flights are always more expensive and service is awful.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,,Flight down to Florida delayed 30 mins because the plane over-fuelled. On the way back flight was delayed for 6 hours then canceled until the next day with no explanation. The Frontier workers wouldn't even come down to the gate to tell us we had to go by the Departure board. Next day flight was delayed 3 hours because the crew was legally required to have a certain amount of time before next flight. If they had to delay flight for 26+ hours you would think the flight would leave on time. Also because so many people just jumped on another flight back they had to role call to see who was on the plane. Never felt less secure on an airplane.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,"I flew at the last minute from San Diego to Denver. Frontier had better flight time selections and fares than Southwest (won't make that mistake). It was impossible to check in online as the hyperlinks didn't work. I called their ""customer service"" number and after being on hold for 30+ minutes I gave up. I don't understand their baggage and carry on policies and pricing and quickly realized that any money saved by not flying Southwest would be eaten up by these stupid nit picking fees. I finally prevailed on their horrible website and arrived at the airport to hear that their whole software system was brand-new and everyone was trying to figure it out. Then the flight was delayed with no notice to my email or phone. At the gate they had one poor employee trying to handle all these passengers and get the inbound flight all set up to de-plane. This was a bad experience and I will attempt not to fly them ever again."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Where to start? Booked over 4 months ago and was not able to sit with spouse. Charged an extra $30 for a carry on have been sitting to go into the hate at Orlando for over 20 mins now. Got asked once is I wanted a drink but 3 times about trash. Never again!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Went to Punta Cana from Rockford IL on flight 32 on Feb 27th. Flight was on time and the crew made the experience fun and enjoyable. The stewards were funny and even played ""happy"" when we landed! Now for the flight back to Rockford on March 5th on flight 33 I have to say it was by far my worst experience flying! We not only had a 5.5 hour delay but the pilot mumbled when he addressed the passengers to the point no one had any idea what he was saying. I was in row 9 and it took over 1.5 hours just to get a beverage! They didn't even make it halfway through the plane and had already run out of some snacks soda liquor and of all things ice! We had asked if their were any other seats available because our seats did not recline due to the emergency exit behind us we were informed yes there was but the passenger in the end seat had decided to lay across all the seats and they were not willing to ask this person to sit up! Once we landed we had heard many other passengers say how bad their experience was as well. In my opinion the next time I fly anywhere I will stay far away from flying on Frontier."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,,What attracted my husband to try Frontier Airline to Vegas was the cheap fare. Sad to say we got what we paid for. I had no problem with a 2 hour delay nor getting our luggage after 10 hours. I do understand this. But poor customer service and waiting over an hour after disembarking to get our checked luggage is too much. Flying Frontier will be my last option the next time I travel.
,,,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Flight from Cleveland to Denver. Mid day clear skies. They boarded the plane on time. Departure time was no problem but came and went. Captain comes on saying a small paperwork issue. Same story for the next two hours until they made everyone get off the plane. Then their reservation system goes down. Can't get anything but more lying to the passengers. Flight was re scheduled for after midnight. This airline has turned into a really bad airline. So after spending all day being lied to they offer a 10 dollar meal coupon. That will get you a bottle of water and some crackers. No help with booking another airline. Avoid the aggravation and go on another airline. It will be cheaper in the long run.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"They were incredibly inconsiderate. The first leg of my flight was delayed by weather at the destination airport yet the second leg departed from that airport ahead of schedule. Half of my flight was told that the next available flight was 24 hours later or that we could go to an alternative airport 1.5 hours from the original destination in 12 hours. No meal voucher no hotel no compensation - we all slept on the floor. The desk attendant's consolation was ""Well it's better you don't have a hotel because you would have had to come back very early in the morning regardless."" Also add the usual complaints about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour leg. I'd hate to imagine what the larger passengers had to endure."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,"New seats do not recline. My friend and I just flew a quick RT CLE-RSW over a four-day span. We paid for seats with extra legroom. What they don't tell you now is that they just ""upgraded"" (their word not mine) their seats for the whole plane and now none of them recline. The FA told me that doing so resulted in them being able to squeeze 9 more seats into the cabin. So - what good is ""extra"" room if it is actually less roomy than previous experience? Very frustrating - I won't be flying Frontier again."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I have never flown Frontier before my trip from CVG to MCO. I was attracted to the airline because of the lower fares which is great for my family of 5. We no issues on the flight to MCO. Fast forward 3 days later on our return flight from MCO to CVG. We arrived at the airport only to find that our flight had been delayed for 2 hours because of maintenance issues. Understandable. From the time we left the main terminal to the gate the delay went from 2 hours to 9.5 hours. Again we were told it was a maintenance issue. The delay changed again to 10.5 hours. It turns out it wasn't a maintenance issue at all it was a crew issue - they don't have a crew to fly the plane. Supposedly the do now (thus the delay). I'm not sure where the plane is - CVG or MCO. The attendant at the gate told me planes are delayed at least once a week because of no crew but usually the delay is shorter than 10.5 hours. I only wish I would have read the reviews before I booked my flight. It can only be a matter of time. Southwest/AirTran and Delta are substantially more reliable and if you have someplace to be it's worth it to pay a little more.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Flying from Denver to Chicago round trip. Delayed 6.5 hours to get cancelled. Tried the same flight the next day and so far we are delayed two hours. This is the last time I will fly Frontier. They are really bad.

Southwest - here I come."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,World Strides trip home from Fort Lauderdale to Dulles International. Flight canceled on 2/21/15 due to weather which is understandable. We were traveling with 32 middle school students and 9 adults. No flight available for 3 days 2/24/15! After a week long event we had students who would need medication before that date (we expressed this to the agent). We had to sleep in the airport that night because there were no hotels available that was not Frontier's fault but having to stay there 2 more nights with 41 people would have been. When discussing flight options with the very nice ticket agent we discovered that not only would we not be able to fly out for 3 days only part of our group could fly out then. Another group would have to fly out on the 4th day and another on the 5th day! This was totally unacceptable. During our lengthy stay in the airport we discovered from other customers (we were camped out right across from the Frontier ticket counter) that almost all customers were delayed the next day (the weather was beautiful) and those who had flown before stated their flights are always delayed (our flight to Orlando was delayed). The lines for check in were crazy long compared to other airlines. People waiting hours to check in. This could have been a marketing dream for Frontier. Imagine the story of helping out a group of stranded middle school students because Frontier cares. Instead they left us stranded for up to 5 days. No refund. No credit. Now 32 parents will never fly Frontier. 9 chaperones will never fly Frontier. For a price gouging company that advertises low prices then charges not only for checked baggage but for carry on bags and charges for water and sodas and basic channel TV I would think Frontier would at least want to retain the customer base they have. I for one will never use Frontier again. The flight attendants and ticket agents are super. The business model is horrendous. They should be ashamed.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"This was my first experience flying Frontier and will be my last. The outbound flight from Cleveland to Phoenix was adequate but it took over 1.5 hours to receive my luggage. The return flight was a disaster. I arrived at 4pm for my 6pm flight only to find that the fight had been changed to 4.10 pm. I was never informed of the change but the agent lied and stated that I had accepted the change. I was forced to fly Delta through Detroit. Frontier offered a small partial refund for my flight but nothing for my Delta flight. I will never fly frontier again. Interestingly my friends have had similar experiences. In fact Frontier has engaged in a classic ""bait and switch"". Frontier initially offers convenient schedules and then changes the flights to save on landing fees. I will be back flying United."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,This was my first trip with Frontier. We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it. I will have no hesitation in recommending the airline with that caveat.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"No leg room I am a small 5'2"" female and I felt cramped I felt sorry for my brother-in-law who is 6' tall his knees touched the seat in front of him. Apparently the only thing free on Frontier anymore is water everything else will cost you. I got extremely ill on the return flight and they told me they had no blankets or pillows to offer. My thought what do they do if they have an emergency needs to lay down and be kept warm put them in the aisle? No entertainment at all not even TV or music and a 5 hour layover I will never fly Frontier again."

Refunds were offered but what you supposed to do now - book another airline at the last minute? That's triple the fare in most cases!

,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,"Our first flight was great but it was only 45 minutes. We sat in the ""extra leg room"" seating but it was just normal seating… or so I thought. Our connecting flight had us in the very back row. There there is no leg room whatsoever and your knees are directly against the seat in front of you. They do not offer complimentary snacks or drinks but you can pay for half a can of soda for 2.99. The flight attendant was very rude and patronizing. Not only this but our seats were moved from the front all the way to the back without notification to my family. I do not recommend Frontier to anyone. Pay the extra and take United."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,First they delayed our flight leaving Milwaukee to Denver. Then we miss the connecting to Bozeman. Since Frontier does not and will not work with any other airlines we were stuck in Denver because the next Frontier flight to Bozeman was a day an a half away. Very unhelpful and horrible customer service. The only thing they offered was a discount on the next trip. Will never use this airline again. The connecting flight only needed to wait an extra 15 min for us. No beverage service for a two hour ride.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I have only flown this airline once (RT) and will never fly them again. Both times the flight was delayed once by 1/2 hour and once by 2.5 hours. They actually had the nerve to post 'on time' on the electronic board along with the rescheduled departure time. When I questioned the 'on time' the customer service agent said they hadn't yet updated the sign. Um then why does it say 11.30 instead of 9.35? Unfortunately it wasn't until I made my reservation that I noticed a review (1/2 stars) that they are consistently delayed. If you are needing to get somewhere especially if you have a connection I strongly advise you avoid Frontier and if you must pay a little extra for an airline that cares about their customers getting to where they want to go relatively on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,0,no,,Where do I begin. So my cousin and I got to Orlando airport at about 11am. We waited in a line for about 39 mins just to be told that we could not check our bags yet. So we waited an hour and went back to the bag drop off line to check our bags. Again we waited about 30 minutes. Luckily we had paid our baggage check fee online so the process went fairly smooth. We were scheduled to leave at 4.10pm to go to IAD. I received an email saying the flight had been delayed to 5.07. Not even 30 minutes later the flight was changed again to 5.27. Eventually I was notified that the flight was canceled. So we went back to the desk to confirm and the board still stated that the flight was on time. By this time the line was obstructing the flow in the airport and wait times were over an hour long. The cancellation was confirmed but we were told that they were not going to be rebooking and flights or giving any refunds. They gave us food vouchers and a hotel voucher and said we had to call a 800 number. I waited to speak with a representative for over 3 hours and still did not get in touch with anyone. They still did not offer any resolution as to how we were going to get home. So finally my cousin and I had to book with another airline in order to get out of Orlando. The workers were very rude. They had no answers whatsoever. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that I had to go to the end of the line and wait until the supervisor had time. This customer service experience was the worst ever.

After buying the tickets we needed to buy seats pay for bags pay for soda TV peanuts overall cost is higher and service is awful.

Naturally I missed my connecting flight to my destination. Frontier graciously offered to book me onto the next connecting flight - 2 days later. The delay was not because of full flights. It was not due to bad weather. They simply had no scheduled flights for 2 days (48 hours). Frontier provided no offer to book on another airline no offer to refund my ticket except for the single connecting leg no offer to compensate for costs on another airline. No voucher no flight credit. I contacted customer service 3 times. I received 5 hours to sleep in a run-down hotel a half hour from the airport and $15 for an airport dinner. Several weeks earlier I had to book a one way return on United because Frontier changed my return to a 16 hour itinerary with a 9 hour layover. Then I had to book a third ticket just to get out of the airport on my outbound - United to the rescue again. Fly Frontier but be prepared to suddenly spend a couple-few days in your layover airport or city. Or be prepared to buy a last minute fare to get to where you were going. Frontier: Discover a whole new way to fly like driving which is faster."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,0,no,,My family of four which includes a 2 year old and an 11 year old just flew Frontier from DFW to Denver in January and paid in advance for seats in the forth row for easy boarding and u boarding due to my youngest and so we could all sit together. My seats were bought and paid for well over a month in advance and confirmed via email. Upon arriving at airport and boarding we were placed in 4 different rows in the very back of the plane. Luckily a fellow passenger switched seats allowing my 2 year old to sit beside my husband. The same thing happened on the return flight even after spending 1 hour and 57 minutes on hold with Frontier to make sure this didn't happen again. The lady on the phone told me that the 4th row did not exist on the return flight and so once again we were shoved in the back of the plane. The 4th row did indeed exist with some very happy passengers sitting in our paid for seats! Not a happy Frontier past customer!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"My original flight from Chicago was supposed to get me home on Sunday night but was cancelled due to weather despite other airlines flying out. The agents in Chicago were completely unhelpful and utterly lacking in empathy or any semblance of customer service. My only options were a flight two days later (with no food hotel or transportation vouchers provided) or to book with another airline. I didn't have the money to rebook a last minute flight across the county and had to swallow the cost of a cheap nearby hotel with a shuttle. However when I went back to the airport two days later it was to find that my flight was massively delayed due to ""weather"" again despite other airlines having no problems. This makes no sense to me and makes it appear that Frontier just sticks the words ""weather related"" in front of any problem to avoid having to take any responsibility for their delays and cancellations. My flight was delayed more than four hours (with no food vouchers offered) and sat on the runway for a further hour and a half with everyone aboard while the plane de-iced. I asked Frontier agents in Chicago before I left that if their delays caused me to miss my connection in Denver if I would be provided a hotel voucher. I was assured that I would. However when I arrived in Denver myself and the 15-20 others who had missed connections were offered no vouchers or assistance but only extremely impatient and disrespectful service from Frontier agents. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport waiting until the following night for my flight. I'm currently sitting in the airport waiting for my flight and have just found out that it's of course delayed. I'll never fly it again. The cancellations delays lack of communication disorganization and horrible customer service are absolutely startling."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,This nickel and dime airline is the definition of Caveat emptor. In hindsight I should have read the reviews rather than enduring the abominable travel experience between MCO and LAX with a layover in lovely Denver. I can only reiterate what so many have said before. The cheaper price is what hooked me but I would have rather paid the difference for another airline because in the end I probably spent about the same. Frontier reeks of cheapness with no complimentary snacks zero legroom and Direct TV only available to those willing to dish out even more money. The flight attendants barked orders and scowled and the customer service couldn't be more useless. When I asked to move to an earlier flight they informed me it would be an additional $75 per ticket as they do not offer stand-by. So while I wait for my later flight I decided to make good use and warn any curious travelers to avoid this airline at all cost. For me I can say this will definitely be my final Frontier. The best thing I can take away is the valuable lesson to always look before you book.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"My husband and I booked two round-trip itineraries from Denver to Ft. Lauderdale last September for travel this coming March. Just 8 days after the booking Frontier changed our flight destination to Miami and we were told they would not provide a way to get us from Miami to Ft. Lauderdale. Despite the added cost and inconvenience we accepted the flight change. Since that time our flight itineraries have changed 3 more times (that's 4 itinerary changes in 4 months and counting). Today we were informed that our non-stop flight has changed to a 3-leg itinerary flying from Denver to Indiana to Alabama to Miami. We are now arriving over five hours late and in a different city! I waited over an hour to speak with an unsympathetic customer service rep (as is typically the case) who could offer no acceptable remedies and no explanation other than ""they are making many schedule changes at the moment"". Once upon a time I loved this airline! I was one of their elite frequent flyer members and flew them almost exclusively. I don't know what went wrong but over the past decade they have become ""a whole different animal"" indeed!"
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Chicago O'Hare to Denver on January 25th flight 1067. My flight was delayed 12 hours because they didn't schedule a pilot. Staff were rude and did nothing for passengers who waited all day. Flight that was supposed to leave at 1.55 pm finally left at 1.15 am. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Used to love Flying Frontier but they have really gone downhill. There were 6 of us flying to Vegas on Jan 4th and meeting 2 other family members from other states. We were ready to leave and my sister checked to make sure our flight was on time to find out they had cancelled it due to mechanical problems. No email no phone call nothing. We found out that they no longer affiliated with other airlines so we would have to wait and fly out 24 hrs later! We had already paid for a room in Vegas had 2 people already waiting in Vegas for us and were only going to be in Vegas for 3 nights so we had to rush and book a flight on Delta. Not to mention that on Frontiers flights you have to pay for carryon luggage picking your seats if you want anything to drink. This party of 6 will never fly with Frontier again!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,We were supposed to leave Orlando at 9.30am. I checked the website before we left for the airport and it showed a 30 minute delay. By the time we got to the airport it had been pushed back twice more totalling a 1.5 hour delay. I looked at the screens inside the airport to see where the flight stood before we checked our bags. It showed our flight was on time. We went to the ticket counter to check our bags and there was no mention of a delay. We went through security and made our way to our gate. Still no mention of a delay. At the gate our flight didn't show up but instead they had a flight leaving an hour after our scheduled departure. I made my way to the counter and it was the first time Frontier acknowledged there was a delay. After being told nothing I had to keep checking the website for updates. The flight was pushed to 12.00 then to 3.30 then to 6.30 and eventually to 7.30. I did over hear a couple walking away from the counter saying Frontier was flying a part from Denver to Cleveland hoping that would fix the problem. They couldn't arrange for a plane to take us to Cleveland we had to wait for that same plane. The poor folks in Cleveland were in the same boat we were in Orlando. We rebooked on another airline and I lost track of when if ever our original flight left. Last I heard it was delayed 10 hours and counting. They never updated us as we sat waiting and you had to wait an hour plus on the phone to cancel your seat to be eligible for reimbursement. The reimbursement was meagre to say the least. It only covered a fraction of what I paid to fly home.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,"Flight from Miami to Philadelphia 1/18 after a cruise. Arrived at airport at 11 am for 8.30 pm flight. Couldn't check in bags until 3 hours before flight. Learned flight delayed until 1 am. Checked in bags at 6 for flight told flight delayed until 4 am. Frontier was supposed to text delays but did not. Offered to refund money and cancel our flight but couldn't reschedule us to leave for 3 days. Arrived for 4 am flight delayed until 5 because of ""security issues with plane"". Never explained delays. Last Frontier flight for us."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I used Orbitz.com to buy round trip tickets from Raleigh to Trenton price was great. No complaints about the flight into Trenton however I was notified hours before it was time to return home that my flight had been cancelled. There were no weather issues the representative could not tell me why the flight had been cancelled. I explained that I had checked out of the hotel and had nowhere to go I asked the Frontier representative to connect me with another airline or to cover my hotel expenses and received no assistance whatsoever. The next available flight was 2 days later. I ended up having to stay in a hotel another night and used AMTRAK to return home that morning. I will never use Frontier again this way of doing business was unexpected and I was totally unprepared. The cheap fare turned out quite costly.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,,After repeated late and canceled flights I will no longer fly Frontier. Their ticket prices are cheaper but if you can't reach your final destination (like I was unable to) then it ends up costing you more in the long run. After a delayed 3 hour flight and missing my connection I was forced to cancel my trip to Vegas since I couldn't get on another flight for another day and a half! I have never flown on a Frontier flight that has arrived on time yet. Will not use again.
,,,,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,"I am a business traveler with over one million lifetime miles spread over several airlines. I am a Frontier Summit member and have had that status over the last several years. In the early days I found the airline to be of good quality. Under the new management Frontier has plummeted in my estimation under this guise of ""low cost"". First it is not low cost when the ""nickel and dime"" charges are added in. The under-staffing at my home airport (DIA) and the various regional airports is quite apparent. If one talks to staff or flight attendants the low morale becomes apparent. Needless to say I have a few award miles to spend and then it is adiós to Frontier. What a shame that an airline that was of reasonable quality has been driven down by these new owners."
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Came back from Chicago on Monday Dec 29. Was a great flight arrived into Orlando 10 minutes early the crew were friendly. Would take Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew round trip from Trenton to Raleigh for $89. The flight was on time and coming home I was actually late to my plane and they waited an extra couple minutes to allow me to board. Would definitely use them again. Prices are unbeatable. Complaints are from those expecting a commercial airline. This is a discount airline and you get what you pay for. Our family uses Frontier for business as well and have never had an issue.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,,Terrible service. Did not inform us that we have to pay for carry on bags ($35). Not enough staff to help you to check in. Our flight was supposed to board at 5.40. At 5.40 they started boarding a plane going to a different location at our gate. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6.15 and the flight they began to board was leaving at 6.30. We had to stand around and wait to board after their flight left at 6.30. We didn't leave until 7. Very disorganized. Anytime anyone asked what was going on they sent us away with no explanation. It wasn't until after 6 when they informed us of the other plane. Never fly Frontier!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"Flew on a Saturday Jan 3 2015. Flight was delayed in Houston because of ""weather"". Missed our connection in Denver Frontier said the next available flight to Seattle was Jan 6th. Would not put us up in hotel. Frontier lied to us it was a mechanical issue in Bozeman that started it all that was from the Pilot. Plane finally loaded but after sitting for 30 mins on runway the pilot told us she had reached her limit on hours went back to gate and sat for 1 hour before they rescheduled flight to next morning Frontier didn't pay for hotel rooms. At airport the next morning Frontier board the plane going to Denver with passengers going to San Francisco had to de-plane and remove all luggage. Finally took off."
,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,This was my first experience with Frontier. Even though I saw bad reviews I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it out. I booked online through Orbitz and my reservations never made it into the Frontier online system. I could not access my info so I had to use their 800 number for dealings. I paid $40 to upgrade my seat selection and another $20 for my checked bag at check-in. The only part of their online system that worked was online check-in but I had to try twice before it actually worked. At my departure I waited 45 minutes to drop my bag. The customer service was unorganized and rude. Why check and pay ahead of time if I still have to stand in the same line as those who haven't? At the departure gate it got worse. The screen displayed the flight information and they announced boarding so I naturally proceeded to the line. I was zone 1 and when the agent scanned my boarding pass he abruptly informed me that this was not my flight. It was in fact a delayed flight that was supposed to already be in the air. The screen continued to show my flight info and half the people in line were misinformed about where the plane was actually going. We were told that our plane was at the airport and would arrive at the gate once this plane had left. Meanwhile our captain co-pilot and flight attendants were also sitting in the waiting area and had no clue where the plane was. They were laughing and joking (rather loudly) about the delayed status and disorganization of the airline. Everything was very unprofessional. An hour after our scheduled departure we finally took off. I still have to take my returning flight so I hope they will redeem themselves. I will never ever book a flight with Frontier again!
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Terrible airline. Will never fly again. On one of the busiest days of the year Frontier delayed our departure for almost 4 hours and then cancelled. Since they have no airline affiliations they couldn't offer any other travel options only option was a flight two days later or refund of ticket. They gave us our money back but it doesn't exactly cover the loss of our vacation planned months in advance. I've learned to always check if the airline has co-operating airlines with which they can rebook passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,,This is the first time I took the new version of frontier. The experience is not at all good not on par with other airlines. I will gladly pay the extra $50 next time to go with a better carrier. My flight was delayed by more than two hours. I only found out about the delay at the airport when I picked up my boarding pass. Desk agent didn't tell me you figure it out on your own from the hour-later boarding time on your boarding card. No one at the gate and the gate monitor said flight on time for a whole hour while I waited. Then told the flight was delayed another hour. Still Frontier doesn't show the delay. Reason for the delay? None I could find. All the other flights in this concourse were on time. Not a happy customer and I will not be back. I rate even Spirit better than this.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,0,no,1,Horrible customer service and lack of empathy for guests flying with them. Flight was scheduled to leave at 12.40 to Georgia and was delayed until 1.11 pm. Around that boarding time the announcer made another call to let everyone know that the flight would further be delayed until around 4.30 pm due to the incoming aircraft having a cracked windshield. If they were aware of the situation beforehand why lie to the entire crowd of people waiting and expecting the initial delayed flight to depart at 1.11. To further add insult Frontier never offered any service recovery discounts fee waiver etc. Their guest service and accommodations are terrible. Many people were complaining to the staff that they were on a tight schedule for weddings birthdays etc and Frontier Airlines did nothing to help myself or those guests. Never again will I be flying with this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,Trip from Atlanta to Denver. No issues in Atlanta crew was very nice. In Denver the desk staff were borderline rude and wouldn't acknowledge you unless you use the kiosk to print the boarding pass but no one was willing to explain how to use the kiosk. Then had to reprint the boarding pass at the kiosk for unexplained reasons. I want to deal with people not computers. Desk staff was rude in Denver but flight crew was refreshing. Flight from Atlanta was actually early and return flight was on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Flight 133 Dec 2 Dallas DFW-Denver DEN. Flight 657 Dec 2 Denver DEN-San Francisco SFO. Very unimpressed. They charge for carry-on bags which is bad enough but they actually charge more for carry-ons than checked bags. The employees I encountered were very unfriendly and unhelpful. And lastly they charge for everything but water. Bad experience overall.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"After arriving at Dulles it took well over an hour to get luggage off loaded from the plane. When we finally found someone who worked for Frontier they advised that baggage is contracted out at Dulles. We were told that there were only 2 people working baggage as they had ""a bunch of people call in sick."" They waited for 3 planes to land and unloaded all 3 planes before sending bags to the carousels. It took so long that the hotel shuttle left and I had to pay for a cab. Return flight after a 20+ hour international flight I was told I could not check my luggage through on my final leg until 2 hours before the flight. Family connecting with Delta and Southwest checked their bags immediately. I had to sit in the airport lobby for 5 hours before I could check my 1 bag. I will try to avoid flying Frontier in the future!"
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,I am a frequent business traveler and I will never fly Frontier again. Having to pay for carry on luggage is ridiculous. If they are trying to reduce the number of carry-ons then they should just allow 1 free checked bag. But that wasn't the most frustrating thing. Even though I checked a bag on line and had my printed receipt I had to re-check the bag at least he kiosk at Denver because I was told that was the only way they could print my baggage tag. If that's true then I'm going to fly an airline with the capability of printing their own baggage tags from this point on!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,$30 for a carry on drinks $2 and up snacks you also have to pay. I didn't select a seat to upgrade the first time and I was put in the back of the plane. On the way back home I paid for an upgrade seat and it didn't recline back.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,I honestly can't complain. We paid for seats that didn't have much legroom. Because they were only $3. I would say we got what we paid for. Nothing was complimentary other than the water. The flight attendants were nice and we got from LAX to Denver right on time. We paid for carry on. We followed the instructions on measurements and weight of our luggage. We had no problems whatsoever.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,"I am a frequent traveler. I booked round trip tickets for two. The first flight was to leave at 6.05 am. We loaded on time but sat on the runway for 2 hours while the computers ""rebooted"". This delay of course caused us to miss our connection flight in Denver. Causing us to miss much of the first day activities. On our return flight we made it out of LAX on time on arrival in Denver it appears that our connection flight was on time. 30 min after we landed our flight was delayed for 5+ hours. No explanation was given to us. They did give us $15 food coupons 45 min before all restaurants closed ""after we had already paid for our meals"". Every gate in the Terminal had an unused plane sitting at it. Not any cheaper "" when you count baggage fees"" than any other carrier and I have never had so much trouble keeping a schedule. There was no weather in any part of the country by the way. We haven't made it on the delayed flight yet. Entirely possible that we didn't make the 3am flight either. Avoid at all cost."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,This was my first time flying Frontier and perhaps my last. My main complaint was assistance for customers with reduced mobility. I am a stroke survivor and was forced to walk up stairs because there was no ramp. The crew offered no help. Also you could board the plane from either the back or front. It was confusing because people bump into each other trying to store their luggage.
,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,My reservation was lost although they billed my card twice and I had to pay the higher last minute fare. Both flights delayed. They lost my luggage and it was not found for 3 days. There is no on site help desk for lost luggage just a phone number (not toll free) which no one answers after leaving a handful of messages. After returning to the airport the next day I was told to call the complaint number - it is only open for 3 hours a day and a recording told me there was an hour wait. Fly an airline that is customer centric if you don't want to get surprised like I did.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,no,,Frontier Airlines poor planning in notifying its passengers in a timely manner is ridiculous. Frontier waited until 6.30 am to make an announcement to its passengers about the flight being delayed due to crew rest. Boarding time was scheduled for 7.10 and flight schedule to leave 7.45 am moved to 8.55 am. So why didn't the airline notify customers via phone (text) or email concerning this change so that passengers could have stayed at their hotels or homes little longer. Why ask for phone number when check in online if you not going to use for that purpose. Ridiculous Frontier Airlines and inconsiderate of your customers.
,,,,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,4,no,4,Frontier should be ashamed of their lack of customer assistance at Chicago ORD on October 31 2014. The customers were completely aware of the fact that all airlines were not able to land or take off due to heavy winds. That was not the problem. We were frustrated by the fact that nobody showed up at the Frontier gate until 7.30 pm and our flight that was originally scheduled for 4.10 was changed 3 times before a Frontier staff member made an appearance at the gate. On my return flight on November 4 we were expecting to board at 7:10 as stated on the boarding pass but there was no gate agent available again. Then every passenger who had paid to bring carry on luggage was asked to fit their bag into the measurement apparatus at the gate - the delay was ridiculous.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Frontier Denver to Seattle - Oct 7 - Oct 22. Both flights were great! Love online check in - member of Rewards Club so $15 bag. I think the problems that others may experience are back east more than the original Frontier areas. Has some very decent employees. Enjoyed the flights and will travel with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Three of us travelled round trip on Frontier between Washington Dulles and Fort Myers Florida. Our experience was excellent. Frontier was not only $100 cheaper per ticket than any other airline flying the same route but it was also the only airline offering direct service. We opted not to reserve seats to save money yet when we checked in Frontier assigned us seats together. Usually when traveling each of us would have brought a separate carry on bags but because Frontier charges for carry on as well as checked bags we opted to share a large checked bag for the same cost as a single carryon. Boarding was orderly the plane clean the crew pleasant and the flight was on time. We definitely will use Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,,I'm a frequent flyer so for me to say that this is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on is quite accurate. Where do I even begin? After purchasing a ticket that was supposed to have one free bag checked I was told at check in that I'd have to pay $25 to check in my bag. In addition I was told had to either pay $35 for my carry on or get it checked in for $30. Are you kidding me? That's already 3/4 my ticket. Then I arrive at the gate just to find out there was a delay. Not to mention the customer service was rude and made us wait 30 minutes in line to check in. Please if you care about your money and time do not fly with this airline. They rip you off completely and are shameless about it. Please spare yourself the trouble.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Drove to Chicago on 10/24 and paid for a hotel to be at O'Hare by 5am 10/25 for a 7.30 direct flight to Cancun. Due to a scratch on the nose of the plane that we were told would take 45 minutes to fix we waited and waited until finally leaving at 5.30pm. Instead of being at our resort by 1pm we arrive there after 10pm. While delays can be expected with any airline a 10 hour delay was ridiculous. The gate agents were rude and aside from a food coupon for each passenger they did nothing. Our vacation was cut short by an entire day. The agents announced that if we wanted to complain to call the travel agency. I will avoid Frontier. We've flown extensively and again delays happen. But not 10 hours and if it did happen I'd think they would do more than give you an attitude and a cheesy food voucher. Very disappointed.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,2,no,,"Just flew SLC - Denver. Paid extra for classic plus which was to include early seating extra leg room free checked bag and carry on and one free alcohol drink and other drinks free. Guess what: after 22nd of this month - no free drinks. ""Didn't I get the email?"" How can Frontier just take away something I paid extra for? Will avoid this airline if at all possible."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,My Frontier flight was scheduled about 3 hours after a long intercontinental flight to Denver supposed landing and I was really scared after reading all bad reviews. However the experience was very nice. We did not do online check-in but it took literally 1 minute to check-in on the counter. When making a reservation I paid for carry- on items instead of check-in. When I found that out I called and wrote to customer service and they told I'll be able to check my item in and so it was. The staff were helpful the flight departed and landed without delays. When we landed one of the bags was damaged (whichI think is not airline responsibility). We went to Frontier representatives in Bozeman airport (it was around 11 pm)and they just brought us a new bag. You have to pay for carry-on and check-in baggage and drinks but the ticket price is still good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2,no,1,"Arrived two hours early for a flight from O'Hare to Dulles. We had pre-printed our boarding passes and paid for our additional checked luggage. We simply need to check the luggage at the counter. Our party of five - along with several others were redirected out of the line to some type of ""domestic"" holding area as they attended to an international flight. About a half hour into our wait the redirection stopped. However those of us in the holding area were left to stand there for another half an hour without further direction. There must have been twenty travelers that arrived well after we did that found their way in front of us in a very long line. My son- in-law took matters into his own hands as it was obvious that the Frontier service reps had no intention of returning for us. Had it not been for his negotiating with the people in line we all might still be sitting there. Upon arrival at our destination we sat at the gate for a half an hour before de-boarding. Despite this wait we waited an additional 40 minutes for luggage to begin flowing at the baggage claim. I am a well seasoned traveler for both business and pleasure. This was my first experience with this airline and it will certainly be my last. I would never fly this airline again!"
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Unpleasant staff; unwilling to assist in any way expensive baggage fees including carry-on old planes with broken seats extra charge for a soft drink and the list goes on. The price of the ticket was not any cheaper than any other airline but the service and lack of customer care made it a very negative experience across the board. Especially for a handicap passenger or anyone with special needs it is a bad choice to fly Frontier!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,,My wife and I flew from Denver to Minneapolis. They changed our seats at the last minute by calling us up to the counter. We argued to no avail. Rude agent says they don't have to explain. We were reassigned seats to the back of the plane and separated. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Due to storms our flight was over 30 minutes late leaving Atlanta. Knowing that we only had 35 minutes to make our connection I expressed my concern to two of the flight attendants on the plane before take-off. They assured me that due to flights being late that it shouldn't be a problem making our connection since the tower was aware. We arrived 15 minutes after our connecting flight left. We were offered stand-by on the last flight to Phoenix along with 10 other passengers. We were told that there were no seats available the next day and would have to fly stand-by on any of the flights to Phoenix on Tuesday. We were confirmed for a flight on Wednesday. This was unacceptable since we had to return to work on Wednesday. When I asked if we would be provided with food and hotel vouchers I was informed that it wasn't Frontier's fault and that we would not be given any form of compensation. Taking matters into our own hands we chose to fly into Las Vegas and rented a car to make the 5.5 hour drive home. I was told that flights cannot be held yet as I sat waiting for the stand-by flight I witnessed Flt 583 to Salt Lake City at 7.05pm being held for a flight that had arrived late at the gate next to it. I have been flying for 40 years. I have seen a drastic decline in the quality of air travel over the years. To go from getting a hot meal on the plane to having to pay for a can of soda. The lack of compassion from Frontier's customer service center is disturbing to say the least. I wasn't even offered a discount voucher for a hotel as I was told I should have been. It's a shame that the customers who pay for a service are treated with disrespect.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,My daughter has flown Frontier Airlines from Seattle to Denver to Bismarck and back on several occasions so I should have known better. Her flights were almost always late and there were several times they were late enough for her to miss her connections to Seattle or to Bismarck. Still the cheaper fare wooed me. Well after leaving 45 minutes late on my flight to Denver and 3 hours late from Denver I am no longer interested in the savings. Goodbye Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,6,Like some of the folks here I questioned my sanity for booking Frontier after reading the reviews! But it was the only non-stop to Denver from Reagan National. I was pleasantly surprised OK so my standards are not that high but was more then comparable to US Airways I normally fly to Florida. As another reviewer said read the rules. There was a woman on the Denver to DC was arguing about the size of her carry-on at least this airline sticks to their guns about the size allowed.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,3,no,,My family and I recently traveled using Frontier Airlines. I must say the ticketing counter staff Frontier has are the most incompetent representatives I have ever seen. We arrived at the desk approximately 90 minutes prior to flight. We had our tickets and baggage all previously taken care of online. We stood inline for 45 minutes waiting to just get our baggage checked and placed on the conveyor belt while the only representative spent this entire time with one customer ahead of us. When we finally got to the desk we were informed it was too late to send our bags to the plane. After attempting to explain we have been waiting the representative charged an additional $225. then put us on a flight 12 hours later which created a domino affect with our rental car and hotel being cancelled for a no-show. I am disappointed with our service and trip therefore I warn others to look elsewhere for air travel.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Flying from Ft. Lauderdale to Cleveland on 9/28/14. Flight was supposed to leave at 8:00 PM. At the airport flight posted a delay to 11:30 PM. Good weather. Flight then posted to 10.30. Got something to eat just outside terminal. At 9:30 went to gate. Fight cancelled with no announcement and nobody at the gate. Found all the passengers at the check in. Only two employees and one line. No alternative fights until Wednesday. Missed my appointments and had to forfeit the return fight on another airline. Buyer Beware. Read all the bad reviews.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Charlotte NC (CLT) to Washington Dulles DC (IAD). Sep 19 2014 - Sep 21 2014. Beware: Extra fees. You will have to pay for you carry on going to the city you are traveling to and on the way back $25-35. Staff are extremely unprofessional and I do not recommend this airline to anyone.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"We flew Frontier from Tampa to Denver and back again on 9-17 to 9-26. I had read reviews thought I was insane while booking and decided to get familiar with the rules and regulations posted on their website. We used the check in baggage after signing up with early rewards and it cost us $15.00 each way per checked in luggage. Had no problem toting a decent sized bag on board as our ""personal"" item. Seating was $3.00 each way - still not a lot to pay to have a seat on board together. Thought the flight crew was rather bland on the flight to Denver our return trip was the complete opposite. I totally enjoyed all the jokes both by the pilot as well as the rest of the crew! Very relaxing flight. That being said I would definitely without a doubt let Frontier take me where I need to go in the future."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Surprised by all the fees. Their ticket price is deceptive as Frontier charges for carry on and seat assignments and provides nothing in the cabin for economy. Website charged x2 for a single carry on. Dropped the second passenger for return trip. Could not get boarding pass online or at the airport check in device. Had to wait for the staff to show up. Absolutely no chance of getting through to a person at the 800 number tried x3 minimum wait was 34 minutes (they said). Minimum leg room. Passenger in front could not recline seat all the way without breaking my legs which she tried several times. The single plus of the experience was the cabin crew. They were fine both ways. But flying is too much of a hassle to put up with the likes of Frontier's bait and switch and poor communications. We actually paid more once all the extra fees were added in. Will be willing to pay a lot more to avoid Frontier in the future. Plus the aircraft we flew in were extremely old Airbus 320s. The 320 went into service 26 years ago.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,I arrived with my family to fly to Atlanta GA. We arrived with more than enough time to check our baggage and make the scheduled flight. There were two representatives when we arrived one representative just closed his site and walked away leaving only one person to service the remaining passengers. The lady left alone was very slow helping one customer which lead to the remaining passengers being left without enough time to process their baggage. When we got to the desk she informed us that it was too late and she would have to reschedule our flight. We tried to explain that we have been waiting in line for at least 20 minutes and there was more than enough time if they were properly staffed. She just apologized and rescheduled our flight for an all night red eye flight that will leave us short on time if not late for the graduation we planned to attend. She also charged us $75 each totalling $225. This was my first attempt to use Frontier Airlines as of now I will never use this airline again. I now see why they are rated number two in airlines with the most complaints.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"There will be additional fees. You will have to pay for your baggage (both checked and carry-on). Your seat will not be guaranteed unless you pay a minimum of $8 to select your seat. Frontier has a strategy of overbooking presumably to ensure full flights. Every day groups of these extra passengers are forced into later flights. ""Check-in is 45 minutes prior to departure"" means that you will be charged $75 and forced into the next flight if you do not check-in 45 minutes prior to departure. Frontier is the only airline that pulls their employees from the check-in counter and shuts down their check-in computers 45 minutes before departure to ensure that you will not be allowed in if you arrive late. I was running late to my flight this morning and called Frontier's 1-800 number at the suggestion of the friendly JetBlue check-in folks as Frontier's counter had recently been abandoned. I manoeuvred my way through the expected automated system and finally reached a woman who handled my situation with the patience and understanding of a grizzly woken from hibernation. I was interrupted and rudely instructed to be quiet and listen to the rules before rebooking my flight. By the way this airline treats its passengers I should not have expected their employees to be any happier. Frontier employs bait-and-switch policies to maintain the ""cheap ticket"" reputation. In reality Frontier's customers are not presented with an honest estimate of the cost of their travel at checkout. My conclusion is that the service one receives from other airlines is well worth the additional 20% in initial ticket costs. You will end up paying that much more to Frontier anyway."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I have flown Frontier many times over the past several years. My last flight with the company will be my last! I flew economy class knowing that I would have to pay extra for checked and carry on luggage. Prior to my trip I used Frontier's website to determine the acceptable dimensions of a carry on bag. I then measured the bag I intended to take. It was within the guidelines provided on the website. I paid to check one bag and proceeded to the gate to board the flight. Just prior to boarding the gate attendant required me to place my carry on bag in a little box to ensure that it was of proper size. It did not fit by less than a 1/4 of an inch in the length. They immediately charged me $50.00 for the carry on. I have flown with this same carry on bag for many years it has even taken several trips on Frontier and fits perfectly under the seat. Needless to say because of this experience I will pay a little extra to fly on Southwest and/or United at least then I will know exactly what its going to cost me before I leave the house!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,"I recently flew from Dulles to Atlanta and back and for the most part it was a pleasant experience. I have flown AirTran more often than another airline and Frontier is comparable. I bought my tickets directly from Frontier about 4 months in advance. I paid $20 for a carry on $15 for an exit-row seat and $3 to choose my seat at time of purchase (twice coming and going) and my total round-trip fare with fees was $198 so if I had not paid the extra fees it would have been $122. In reading the reviews here I see that many people buy their tickets from third party sites (Orbitz etc.) and are surprised by the ""hidden fees"" when they reach the gate. I really think that they have only themselves to blame. First every time you fly you should check the airline's website for their policies; the fees are very clear on Frontier's site. I think even the third-party sites tell you to check the airline's site. I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for people who make assumptions and then become indignant when their assumptions don't match reality. I also read below that the flight attendants wouldn't help lift luggage because of ""policy."" On both my flights the staff were very helpful with luggage so clearly it's either not a policy or one that not all attendants heed. The only minor complaint I have about Frontier was that both flights were late to take off by about 20-30 min. There seemed to be no particular reason for the delay. I didn't have a connecting flight so I didn't care but it might be useful info."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Never mind extra fee's! How about no show flights! Recently stranded in Milwaukee flight 996 - Milwaukee to Trenton. Arrived 4 hours early for the flight and saw on status board that the flight was cancelled. Went to ticket counter and no one was there when staff showed up for work I addressed them with the problem and was told a matter of factly that the flight was cancelled. I was treated like a fool and no one - not one Frontier rep cared that we didn't have a ride home. I had to rent a car and drive to Trenton from Milwaukee. Do not fly with this airline they will strand you and leave you to fend for yourself.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,"Frontier used to be a solid budget airline and living in Denver I was comfortable using them. I must admit that the last month I've told many how my wife was recently treated. To start they are getting very skimpy on extras so she found out that her bag check would cost $35 when she got to the airport. This all but kills the advantage they have over United for 'cost' though if she had known earlier she would have bag checked to save money. More important though was the way that first the agent at the gate treated her about how she should have checked after she obviously didn't know about the fee. It was more of a ""it's your fault"" thing. Then she explained that she is recovering from shoulder surgery to the agent who told her to discuss this with a flight attendant and they will ""Assist"". Unfortunately when she boarded the less than helpful person said ""Well you should have bag checked if you have an issue lifting your bag and then told her per policy she couldn't help"" My wife is very kind when speaking and pretty tough but the really rough attitudes had her crying. I'm sorry but I fly a lot and will do anything in my power to never fly them again and I live where the hub is."
,,,,,,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,I took time to read the reviews of previous passengers of Frontier Airlines and if I had relied solely on what I had read I would not have bought tickets. I disregarded the reviews read all the requirements for baggage fees and seating costs and bought tickets for my daughter and I. Did round trip from Baltimore to Florida and back. It was a pleasant experience. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. Even after paying for luggage seats and hand luggage the total fare was less than most airlines if not all. I will definitely fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"We arrived 90 minutes prior to our flight and (despite discrepancies in their fee structure from what their website stated) we made it to our gate trouble free. Only then did we find out that our flight was delayed by 2 hours because the co-pilot didn't show up (come to find out they had known for hours but didn't update their system so we woke up at 2.00am for nothing). They told us we would make our connecting flight despite the delay which was an impossibility given the schedule. Of course we missed our connecting flight and Frontier representatives were unhelpful and unapologetic. No one can tell us where our luggage is or when we will get home. Other carriers have open seats going to our destination but Frontier refuses to buy us a ticket. The next seat they can ""promise us"" will be 24+ hours after we arrived here!"
,,,,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,Another Frontier flight where the TV's don't work. On the way out from Denver today no TV and on the way back from Los Angeles tonight the same problem. Planes are as dirty as I have ever seen them. What happened to my favorite short run airline. I'm a Summit member who can't believe how quickly things have gone bad. Date of flight 9/6/14.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,We will not fly Frontier again. My husband and I bought our tickets through cheaptickets.com and picked Frontier because it had a non-stop flight to our destination and because they had the cheapest fare by about $20 a ticket. We were only going to be gone a short time so we both packed a carry-on so we could avoid paying to check a bag. When we checked in for our flight we found out that we would have to pay $35 for each carry-on! We thought Frontier was ridiculous to charge so much (if at all) for carry-ons when no other airline we've flown with charge for that. Also Frontier charges almost $2.00 for a can of soda or juice. You only get one free cup of water after that the price goes up to the same as for a soda. Frontier lures it's customers into buying airfare by offering tickets that seem to be the lowest priced but then rob you with all the hidden fees. Frontier also has its flight attendants pitch a credit card offer to the passengers during the flight. I know that it is their job to do so but I found it extremely annoying. Although the flight attendants were friendly it does not make up for the feeling of being robbed. I will give Frontier a point for the flight attendants being friendly and a point for it being a non-stop flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My husband and I arrived 55 minutes prior our 10.13 flight from Seattle to Denver on Labor Day. When we arrived to the ticket counter we saw a small sign that stated that a Frontier representative would not arrive until 11am and to use the nearby kiosks. We attempted to use the kiosks but the system stated that due to our late arrival we would need to speak with a Frontier representative. Since there was no representative at the ticket counter we had no way to check in for boarding. When we call customer service they let us know that there was no way we would make our flight but Frontier would graciously charged an additional $150 to place us on another flight. We then were charged $50 for our 1 carry on bag.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,"We flew Frontier for the first and last time this weekend. We purchased our tickets online with the assumption we could carry on our bags for the weekend. We were charged $60 each way. This was not disclosed when we purchased our tickets through Expedia. We were not able to sit together as the selection online required more payment to select our seats to ""upgrade"" in which we were not even upgrading we just wanted to choose our seats. They now even charge for a pop. We fly 1-3 times per year. Just charge what you want up front (offer discounts for those who have no luggage which would probably be one in thousands) so people know what the total bill will be. It is very deceitful and unfair practice to get more money when it's advertised as the lowest fare etc."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,"My daughter needed a ticket from Dallas TX to Minot ND. There are only 4 airlines that go to Minot. When we started looking at prices Frontier offered the one-way flight for a total of $174 which included a lay-over in Denver CO. Regarding the ""nickel and dime"" tactics - I actually appreciate them! It provides the option of taking the services for an additional cost or leaving them and saving some cash. The day before the flight we checked in online. During this check-in process I added a checked bag for $15. The option was there to select a seat for $3-$25 but we opted out of the choosing. We printed the receipt for the bag the boarding passes and a receipt. The flight was scheduled to deport at 2.15pm so we arrived at DFW at 11.30 to make sure we had time should any issue arise. When we walked up to the ticket counters a Frontier service agent was standing by the kiosks to provide assistance. Since I had printed my boarding passes she directed me to a counter clerk who was checking bags of passengers who did not need to check-in at the counter. The checked bag weighed 50.5 lbs. They checked the bag. I asked about my daughters purse/bag to make sure we would not have a problem with it being too large to count as the free personal bag. She assured me it was fine. Both agents were friendly. This entire process so far had taken 5 minutes. The plane arrived to the gate boarded and took off on time from DFW to Denver. I asked my daughter about the seats and such and she said it was the same as most other flights she has been one. She did take her iPad with movies on it and watched that during the flight. Landed in Denver on time. The Denver to Minot flight arrived boarded and departed on time. She had a smooth flight the flight was relatively uneventful and arrived in Minot 5 minutes early. After getting off of the plane it took her about 20 minutes to get her luggage and she was on her way out of the airport! Overall a budget airline with great prices."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Frontier seems to be doing their very best to consistently frustrate and anger the people who fly with them. My first experience I was stuck in Denver for 18 hours due to cancellations and delayed flights. Then when I requested another flight staff did absolutely nothing to help me switch my flight book a different flight or even refund my original ticket. They had me on the next available flight at 9.30 am the next morning (which would have been a 29 hour layover). I ended up just booking another ticket with another airline to fly to out. I understand weather causes delays but at least work with the travelers to accommodate them on different flights/airlines or give them hotel/food vouchers to help. It was ridiculous. The next experience (and hopefully the last) I had to fly on a different date than the date on my ticket. They tried to charge $450 dollars to change the date by two days even though I had just purchased the ticket a few hours earlier that day. They refused to refund the ticket (it would be issued as ""credit"" for a different ticket) and wanted to charge me an additional $75 dollars to cancel the ticket. The airline employers are extremely rude. The line was long the travelers were getting frustrated while the only two workers did everything in their power to take as long as they possibly could. They denied military checked bags (even though I had travel orders) because I had 3 of them and the girl was too lazy to tag them. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and was able to get them all checked for free. Will do everything in my power to not fly with this airline again. Even if I have to pay 50 bucks more for United it still comes out even since I don't have to pay $35 to bring a carryon."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Worst airline experience. The employees are rude and snotty they airline charges you for everything. $15 to pick your seats for a family of 4 that's $60 $30 for a carry on $25 for each 1st checked bag $4 for water no free refreshments here. I can't understand how they stay in business. If you want a roomier seat that's $30. On take off there were unsecure bins in the galley so when the plane pitched up there was a loud crash. We flew this airline because it was the one Priceline recommended for our trip. They took an hour to get everyone's checked luggage to baggage claim. Save yourself the headache pay a little more and fly a real airline carrier.
,,,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"Flight 754 on 8/17/2014 from Sky Harbor to DIA. They have all these rules about when we are to check in etc but when we get there to check in where are they? The Sky Harbor ticket counter was horrible. Not only did we have to wait on them for 15+ minutes when they did show up they sauntered like they had all day. No comments to anyone about our wait. We happened to be first and actually got our bags tagged after the sixth person in line behind us. The gal ""helping"" us was rude and I swear moving as slow as she could. Maybe I should not have said anything about being there first! I have over 200k frequent flyer miles-Southwest here I come!"
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,I have been flying Frontier Airlines for years. Not anymore. Both flights had broken down planes. My flight out of Milwaukee had a flat tyre. There was only 1 maintenance person on duty. They had to call another in to help fix the tyre. Our flight to Denver was delayed 2.5 hours. Of course our connecting flight was gone once we landed in Denver and there were no other flights available. Frontier shuttled everyone to a hotel for the night. On the way back home my flight from Denver to Milwaukee also had a broken plane. Flight delayed by 2 hours because we had to wait for a plane from Los Angeles. I have flown almost every US airline and this is the worst.
,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Flying from Phoenix to Denver. Frontier has all these rules about when passengers need to check in but it is ok to make us wait 15-20 minutes to check our bags. The staff come sauntering down to the ticket counter no apologies and no welcomes. My husband and I were the first ones there had checked in and reprinted our boarding passes and ready to go. Did a ticket agent ask who was there first. Of course not and then we ended up waiting while they dealt with six groups before we were taken care of. When I said we were there first I got the evil eye and then had to wait until the agent got to us and deal with her snarky attitude. I swear that cost us even more time. When I tried to call customer service the edit time is 35 minutes. Guess I am not the only one with issues. I have 200k miles in my frequent flyer program. Guess I will have to be desperate to us those. Southwest here I come.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,What you get on Frontier Airlines is one glass of water free. Everything else costs something and all those something's are so under par that the whole Frontier Experience becomes a terrible experience and a costly one. You really don't get a carry on unless it's as big as an old computer case. Customer service will split up families and try to seat two year olds from their mother and they don't follow through with handicap assistance. I found the whole Frontier Experience not one to do again. I advise you to get a credit card with baggage allowances and fly those airlines. They are better and cheaper. I forgot about my credit cards but I won't forget again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Thunderstorms in Denver are common and although they cause delays the delays are typically limited to 45-60 mins. We flew from Milwaukee to Denver to Santa Ana and back the same way. Our flights were all on time and even arrived a little early each destination. All of the staff were very friendly from the people at the check-in counter the flight crew and even pilots. The check-in counter people were very accommodating to our family with two small children. My husband is a veteran and with his military ID they gave us free checked bags and also even upgraded one of our flights to stretch seating! This was a very appreciated surprise! This was definitely an excellent experience flying with Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,,"Was set to fly out on a Friday to Denver then Bozeman from Atlanta. ATL airport had a fire in a tram which shut down passenger travel between concourses. Long story short we were stranded in a tunnel. I wasn't worried as I told my wife and kids that the airport is shut down so our flight will be delayed. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the monitor had every flight delayed but the Frontier flight it took off without us and several other people. I still thought ""It's ok they will get us out to Denver to catch our connecting somehow."" I was incredibly let down as the airline did nothing to help us just put us on a flight 3 days later. They didn't offer any apologies made no efforts to fix the problem. To make it worse they redirected our bags from Bozeman back to Atlanta on a Saturday. Of course the bags did not make it to ATL. Another 2 and half hour conversation with Frontier - more rudeness. I got a security guard in Bozeman to get a luggage woman to finally locate our bags and hold them for us. It took me 15 minutes what Frontier couldn't do in 2 days."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,,,1,no,,Trying to get home to Orange County CA from Orlando. Flight was scheduled for Monday but I tried to grab an earlier flight. Frontier had zero flights leaving until Monday. On Monday as I arrived at the airport I was notified the flight had been changed to 5.48 am the following day. I was given a hotel voucher. A few hours later I happened to be walking past ticketing and noticed my flight to Denver was now showing 11.48 pm same day (in a few hours). I asked if the flight at 5.48 am tomorrow was still on schedule. She said no that now tonight's 11.48pm flight. No one called or emailed me letting me know about the change. I asked if I could fly the 7.45 am flight next day instead of this 11.48 pm flight. Was told no it's full. When asked if they could try to change my connecting flight time in Denver from 2 pm to something a little earlier they said they didn't know how to do that. I was traveling with a 9 year old and they didn't put us together. I look forward to my 12 hour lay over in Denver now. Will never fly this awful airline again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Excellent service. I flew to Nashville from Montana round trip I have no complaints that's over 4 thousand miles with frontier. We had a delay in Denver but that will happen with all the top notch planes as well.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,I am a medical student in Omaha and took a quick trip out to Durango with friends. The airplane broke down before the scheduled departure the mechanic was not available I missed my connection in Denver and have been here for the last 24-27 hours. Apparently Frontier does not work with other airlines - or other airlines don't work with Frontier. The two men at the gate where I was on standby were less than courteous the ladies at the customer desk were nice but unhelpful. They have no way of checking to make sure that my luggage arrived in Omaha either. For a company that nickels and dimes its customers for seat assignments carry-ons etc. it sure isn't making itself seem worth the money. Just save yourself the headache and fly another airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,,Thunderstorms in Denver are common and although they cause delays the delays are typically limited to 45-60 mins. My flight from STL to DEN was delayed 2 hrs then 4 hrs I wasn't worried as my layover for my flight to SEA was 5 hrs. When we arrived in DEN we were informed that flight was delayed 6 hours (leaving at midnight as opposed to 6 pm. The plane arrived but the outgoing crew had left. They changed the flight until 1.45 am and finally cancelled the flight stranding all 150 passengers in the airport. No rooms offered no meals offered not even a toothbrush!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Flew from SLC to Denver then to Puerto Vallarta. First flew with small children all separated from parents when asked to change seats was told by a very rude stewardess that we had to stay in assigned seats. What person flying wants to sit next to someone else's crying two year old? Then the stewardess had the nerve to talk to other passengers about us very unprofessional. Pay the extra fly Delta.
,,,,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"Flew in and out of Trenton from St. Augustine. A little nervous after reading review however our experience was great. I didn't go in with high expectations and was very pleased with the outcome. First we flew Classic Plus which allowed more leg room (my son is 6'3"" and needs extra space). This allowed us to check a bag each and have carry on for free (in addition to the allowed personal item). The seats were roomy and comfy. The staff at each airport was friendly (we arrived 1.5 hours before the flight with boarding passes printed at home as instructed). Had read horrible reviews of Trenton but found it very nice though small. Restrooms available at the gate a nice little eatery upstairs (before security). If you plan well and read the fine print you should have no complaints. It was 100 times better than my latest flight on United to Newark last month."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,5,Flight Cleveland Hopkins to Fort Lauderdale. Flight was delayed already when we got there because of domino effect of previous flights. It was delayed even more when previous delayed flight to Atlanta had a bad tyre which delayed theirs and our flight by one hour. Total delay time for our flight more than 2.5 hours. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews because they never read the small print. Use your common sense a $30 flight is not going to include baggage fees. Plane was airbus A320 featuring fin the tiger shark. Seats were very uncomfortable and needed new cushions. No IFE. Crew was friendly and we received free drinks for late time. I expected this from a cheap airline so that's why the review is not too negative.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,I've flown 8 times with Frontier airlines and I couldn't be happier with their service. The flights were laid back and quiet. Once I even lost my boarding pass after I went through the security checkpoint. The lady at the terminal was very nice understanding and knowledgeable. After verifying my identity with a few clicks at a computer she printed me out another pass and I was able to catch my flight without a problem. They've never lost any of my luggage either. The inflight crew were always very nice and quick to respond to questions and concerns. The only down-side I could find is that you can only buy in-flight refreshment with a credit card - no cash.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Each time if you are in the front three rows the crew restrict usage of the overhead in preference to the people not already boarded. This usually means that we end up putting their bag further down the plane and the first three bins usually end up not full and people boarding further back of the plane end up using the bins. It is illogical and rude to the passengers already boarded. Now we have to wait to go down the plane to get our bags. It makes now sense. Frontier you have lost me with your ridiculous policy.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,,July 29 2014 was flying from Minneapolis to Idaho Falls one stop in Denver. Ladies at the ticket check in said the flight was overbooked due to weather and we would not make the connecting flight until Aug 3. After 2 hours of going back and forth talking to them about options which they were unwilling to help with we asked how many seats were available well we found out 6 or 7 so why could we not go on our assigned flight? We arrived in Denver the flight to Idaho Falls was delayed and yes there were seats available their too. So why did the ticket ladies not just let us check-in in the first place?? It would have saved us 2 hours of stress. I'll never fly with them again!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Plane departed and returned to the gate three times while in Atlanta due to a warning light. On the fourth try the plane took off - now 5 hours late. Connections were missed in Denver by nearly everyone on the plane resulting in a mass of unhappy yelling customers. Options presented by Frontier were to wait for the next flight - in 48 hours - or get booked on a different airline with additional legs and a long layover. Frontier offered a hotel voucher for what ended up being a 3 hour stay and meal vouchers which were not usable at 1 am. Through this I had a toddler with me who became exhausted and dehydrated. Never again will I consider Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,I had no problems with my flights (PDX-CVG via Denver) either with Frontier's service personnel or my expectations. It strikes me that most of the people posting really bad reviews didn't read the information Frontier provides when purchasing a ticket. Frontier is exactly what it says it is basically an al a carte airline. My flights were on time the staff was professional and courteous. Check in online and print your boarding passes at home and you'll have no problems at the gate.
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I've flown Frontier numerous times and never had a problem except once my luggage was on a later flight. Minor inconvenience and it was returned to me at 2am the next morning. It happens with any airline. The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I guess there's always a first time but I still plan to fly with Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,My sisters and I went to Minneapolis. We left Idaho Falls flight 446 and 120 on July 25 2014. Flights went smoothly and staff were nice. July 29 2014 on our return flights 115 and 447. We arrived at the Frontier counter to check in and were told a tornado hit Denver and all seats were taken and no seats available until Aug 3 2014 so we could get a refund that night. In a panic we checked other airlines to Idaho Falls we could get another flight the next morning Delta or United. We asked the Frontier counter to help us book a flight they said they could not help us either a refund or travel Aug 3. We were about to ask for our refund when my brother in law suggested we try again to get to Denver options were better there to get to Idaho Falls and cheaper. The ladies at the counter said they could not help us we asked if their were seats available on flight 115 finally they said yes there were seats available but we would miss the flight to Idaho Falls. We told them we would take our chances since the flight going to Denver was delayed 1 hour maybe the flight to Idaho Falls would also be delayed they would not assign us seats to Idaho Falls just to Denver only check our baggage to Denver which we opted to carry on. We barely arrived at the gate for flight 115 after 2 hours of fighting with staff at the check in counter as they were boarding. Staff on the flight were very nice and apologetic. Flight 447 was delayed due to weather as we expected and had to wait for seating assignments just as they were boarding. Boarded the plane and again their were a few empty seats. Arrived in Idaho Falls only 30 minutes later than the scheduled arrival time! Had we not insisted that staff get us on flight 115 we would still be in Minnesota.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I arrive with more than 40 minutes to spare for my flight from Trenton to Raleigh. Due to a website issue I was unable to print out a proper boarding pass. Upon arrival the kiosk would not allow me to print my pass as it was under the 45 minute deadline a deadline that I have never encountered in all my years of flying. The Frontier reps at the counter were of no help and were quite hostile to my (and the 7 other passengers) complaints. They are essentially running a racket. Trenton airport is small and the time to the gate from the ticket counter would have been 5 minutes or less. Yet Frontier asks (though I have yet to see this information anywhere other than the Trenton ticket counter) you arrive a full 2 hours before a flight to get a boarding pass. My flight was at 6.25 this morning. It was an absurd experience and easily the worst I have ever encountered flying.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I can only speak to our experience on Frontier and it was good. Flew from Cincinnati to Punta Cana DR on a chartered vacation flight in July 2014. Non -stop. 1 free checked back carry on and soda. Food was extra. Both round trip flights started boarding early left on time and arrived a few minutes early. I would fly Frontier again if the price was right and departure times made sense.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,"I fly Frontier only when I have to that is when there are virtually no other choices. I don't mind some product differentiation in which they charge extra for ""extras"" but it is completely ridiculous that they intentionally won't allow people traveling together to sit together without paying an extra fee. Also charging for carry-on bags is very annoying but I can live with it. The Frontier company attitude appears to be one of ""screw the customer"" and as one who works with customers all the time this attitude really bothers me."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,no,,I flew yesterday from Trenton to Ft. Lauderdale. Was very excited to be flying from Trenton - much more convenient than going to Newark or Philadelphia. Check in was fine - security easy and waiting area adequate. The problem came when the flight was delayed for 9 hours - yes 9 hours. I spent the entire day and evening at the airport. the problem is two-fold - why I am not likely to fly Frontier again: 1) The communication throughout the ordeal was worse than awful - it is pretty clear that they knew early on that this was going to be a horrific wait. They kept stringing us along - many of us could have gone home for the day but instead we were there not knowing what was going on. 2) Second issue - staff are incredibly rude. Staff upstairs at check in were great but those in the gate area - with the exception of the manager were rude unhelpful and without basic knowledge needed to be interacting with passengers. 9 hours late and poor customer service are problems that need to be addressed.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"I took this flight this AM 7/19 with my family Atlanta to Denver. Departure 8.47 on time. Good. Flight was safe landing was nice. All good. Cannot complain. The main reasons I log this review is because if you are flying on a budget (which you likely are on Frontier) then beware of the surly attendants the lack of snacks coffee and beverages available on a 3 + hr flight. This was a 8.47am flight no coffee no individual snacks for purchase one box snack available for purchase and some sodas/juices. I don't look forward to airline ""snacks"" but when you fly with kids creature comforts are welcome at times. Very strange airline. Very strange flight. Not worth the $1400."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,We flew Frontier from Trenton to Tampa because the flight appeared to be the least expensive and because of the convenience of Trenton Airport. It was a mistake that we will never make again! No free luggage at all - the first piece checked in costs $25. If you have a carry it costs even more - $35. When we factor in $8 a day for parking at Trenton Airport we ended paying more than what we would have flying other airlines. The flight was delayed both ways. The fight from Trenton was over an hour late and it was just seem as par for the course. No apologies whatsoever. We're waiting for the flight from Tampa and it is delayed as well. The service is awful - you'll get a cup of water for free. That's it. It is just not worth it.

,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I had checked in online and printed boarding passes and coupons for my luggage. I arrived at the Madison WI airport 40 minutes prior to my flight. Madison is a small airport and usually does not take much time to check luggage and get to the gate. The Frontier desk was closed. There was a sign on the counter stating someone would return after the flight left. We did not make our flight to Seattle. I think it would be most helpful if Frontier stated on their website that the gates close 45 minutes prior to take off and that you will not be able to board your plane. I paid $75 to get a flight out a day later. I asked if I could travel to a nearby airport and take their flight later in the day to Seattle and I was told this was not an option unless I wanted to pay full fare $600. They were unwilling to put us on another airline going out today. I also paid to select my seats so I could travel with my daughter. I am sorry I did not read any of these reviews prior to my trip to avoid such a disaster. I will avoid Frontier at all costs in the future and can only hope my trip tomorrow goes without problems.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,July 11 2014 I travelled to Portland Oregon from Des Moines Iowa via Denver on Frontier Airlines flights 155 and 799. The ground personnel at the Des Moines and Denver Airports were extremely helpful and personable. The air personnel (both flight attendants and flight crew) were courteous and attentive. As for the newly revised baggage policies of Frontier I understand and accept them. Frontier Airlines is no different than legacy airlines. They are here to provide good and comfortable air service to their passengers. But they are also here to make a profit. Again hats off to Frontier for providing courteous friendly and helpful service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight 527 Cleveland to Denver and 745 Denver to Phoenix. Return flight 1112 Phoenix to Cleveland. July 7- 15. My family of 7 just flew to Pheonix from Cleveland and back and I have to say I was very pleased in fact impressed with how smooth things went. I had read several reviews about Frontier and I have to abmit I was nervous about flying with them. We have flown on several airlines and I must say I will be flying Frontier in the future the associates were very helpful and the aircraft were very clean.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,My family and I also had a horrible experience with Frontier and will never fly them again. We had no idea that we would have to pay $35 for carry-ons and $25 for checked baggage. We would have packed differently if we had known this. Each of my children had a small rolling suitcase which we ended up checking and it cost us $250 total extra for the trip. I feel like they robbed us! This extra charge is not common practice among any other airlines I have flown before. Then we get on the plane to discover that all drinks and snacks cost as well. They didn't even offer water on two of the flights. There is very little leg room so you feel like you're packed in like cattle. The whole trip gave us a terrible feeling about Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I am so frustrated with Frontier's new policies to charge you extra for everything: seat assignment carry-on bag checked bag coffee on the flight etc. I'm sure they will be charging for seat belts soon. Frontier used to be my favorite airline but now I avoid them at all costs. I am happy to pay a little extra (or not in many cases) to fly Southwest Airlines where they still let you check a bag for free and carry on a bag with your personal item. If Southwest isn't available I look for anything other than Frontier now. We are spreading the word and on my recent flight from Cincinnati I heard several passengers complaining saying they wouldn't fly Frontier anymore - it's so ridiculous. And because passengers have become so frustrated this has caused Frontier employees to lose their patience... what was once one of the friendliest airlines is now the rudest. Shame on you Frontier - this is the worst example of customer service I have seen in many years.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I arrived at the Sioux City airport an hour before my flight. It's a very small airport with just a few flights and a few gates going at one time. 30 minutes prior to my flight the man at the ticket counter announced they were closing the check-in desk and no one else would be able to print boarding passes or check luggage. I had checked-in previously from home and just needed a boarding pass printed. Frontier did not have a single self- service kiosk at the airport so I wouldn't have to wait in line with people who needed to check baggage. Myself and about 12 other people had been in line for 30 minutes but were turned away from our flight because they closed the desk. The next option they presented was rebooking in Omaha which is a 90 minute drive without offering a complimentary rebooking or even a discounted ticket. Frontier claimed it's their policy that guests arrive 2 hours prior to their flight (but neglected to mention their counter closes 30 minutes prior) so their desk closure was our problem - not theirs. It's pretty appalling that they were able to turn people away like that when there was adequate time to get everyone checked in and boarded if they hadn't closed the counter. The entire situation was unfortunate and handled poorly by the airline and by their employees. I will avoid flying Frontier going forward.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flying to Denver from Seattle and back Frontier failed to get me on either flight. In Seattle the check-in desk was empty at 6pm Saturday with a sign that it would reopen 10 hours later at 4am. The automated machines were not giving boarding passes and I along with other passengers were stranded unable to reach our flight. On the return trip in Denver recent changes in timing cost me my flight. At the start the desk representative wasn't aware that my boarding pass could be printed for me after I'd checked in online. Unlike all other airlines the doors are closed early and baggage handling is closed early in Denver so I forfeited my pre-paid $20 baggage fee to try and make it to the airport. Luckily for me my bag was small enough to be carried on. Arriving at the gate I was told the doors had already closed and myself (plus some others who arrived after me) were told to go to customer service. It seems a policy change at Denver has Frontier closing their doors earlier than any other airline meaning I had no realistic time to reach the gate. Arriving at the customer service desk after being turned away from my plane I was told they would charge me $75 to be put on standby for a full flight 3 hours later. The staff were unsmiling unsympathetic and unapologetic. I'm now sitting through my first wait at the airport on standby for the next flight. I'm told my odds are not good and I'll probably be spending all day waiting for a flight home. I will not fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,"TTN (Trenton-Mercer airport) NJ - CLE (Cleveland-Hopkins) OH. The customer service couldn't have been nicer. They were very nice on the plane. Sure they charge you for a carry on bag and beverage but what do you expect for an incredibly cheap fare. For the most part they were on time it was a bit delayed in Trenton because of minor issues going forward. This is essentially the ""T-Mobile"" of airlines. You pay for what you want how do you expect they make those fares so low. Great Airline gets you where you want to go recommend to anybody who is on a budget."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Pretty good for a low-cost airline. I know they recently changed their policy on carry-on luggage where I believe you have to pay to have a carry-on bag using storage above. My last trip with them was in January of 2014. They were on time friendly bathrooms were clean and the flight was comfortable. In September of 2013 I flew from KC to PDX with a stop in Denver. On the way back to KC we did miss our connecting flight by about 5 minutes. They hadn't taken off yet but they wouldn't let us on because they were to leave the dock in just a few minutes. While it was a bit annoying they got us on the next flight to KC which left about 90 minutes later and I understand why they couldn't let us on that original connecting flight. Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight. With the changes in carry-on costs I'm not sure I will fly with them again because it all really depends on where I can get the best deal but if they are still the cheapest I have no qualms with flying Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,Denver to SFO July 2nd. This is an inferior airline due to its policies and poor customer service. It is a myth that it costs less when you are done with their nickle and diming. The flight crews are fine it is everything leading up to it. The extra charges are over the top. The only thing that does not cost is a glass of water and using the toilet but I would not be surprised if this will change. I witnessed a young woman traveling with a baby who had paid for a checked bag. When she decided should needed to carry it on she offered to pay the difference and was told there was no way to refund and she would have to pay full carry-on fees or she could not board. Robbery by any other name. Any company that gouges the customer to stay in business needs to close its doors. Buyer beware.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Check in was slow and unfriendly. My seat on the way to my destination was slouched to the right and the cushion was worn below the frame so I had two hours of metal frame for a seat. Costs for drinks are what they are but the crew could offer the complimentary cup of water or the charge for bottled. Also if you have to delay a flight 2.5 hours and not update the flight information on the boards I highly suggest you use the intercom when calling to finally board. I appreciate that I was nearly left behind after being told that You were being screamed at to close the doors yet could not properly inform passengers that the plane planning to leave. But here is my favorite part about Frontier Airlines I incurred a baggage fee for my personal carry on that was not large enough to have to stow above when I paid in advance online for only the bag I was checking to go under the plane. Lastly thank you for eliminating one more option when I decide to fly. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again and the other 3 people in my group agree!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"I would never fly Frontier Airlines again. Last week we have a 7am flight departing Denver on Friday morning. We arrived at the airport at 5.30am to check in for our flight we had to check bags so we figured we would just check in at the gate. We waited in line to check in for 45 minutes and when we got to the check in counter the lady stated that their system had locked (it was now 41 minutes before our flight) and we were not allowed to check in or attempt to catch our flight. Their policy is that you must be checked in 45 minutes before departure or you are out of luck we were 4 minutes late but had also been waiting in line for 45 minutes. The front desk lady was extremely rude and unhelpful and just continued saying ""well do you want to pay the $50 per person to change your flight to 5pm tonight"" we did not have any other option. The kicker was we took the 5pm flight and of course checked in 45 minutes before it took us under 15 minutes to get from the check in counter to the gate we could have caught our flight in the morning without any issues. Poor customer service terrible policy took no responsibility for the 45 minute check in line. Absolutely disgusted and will never travel with them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,"Flight 369 from Newport News to Denver. My girlfriend and I checked in at our house and did not have access to a printer to print our passes leaving us with the only option of arriving early to have them printed by a Frontier representative. Confident that we were on time (over an hour early for boarding at this small airport) we stood in line behind a handful of people and two sometimes one representative. The line crept. Two or three people had been assisted in front of us and all the sudden the Frontier representatives walk away behind closed doors for over five minutes. Upon their return all of the paid in full checked in online customers were told in a rude manor that we were all not getting on the plane and to call a 1-800 number for further assistance. We were told it was our fault and there was no other option. The boarding gate could practically be seen from the check in counter there was still 50 minutes to board and all that was standing in our way was a piece of paper to let us through. The clock was ticking while we were about ready to give up. With only a few minutes to spare a woman showed up and took some names and returned with boarding passes. We boarded our flight with a foul taste in our mouths from the unprofessional attitude received from the Frontier representative at Newport News airport. Check- in was ""closed"" but we were all checked in and just needed a pass printed. Why was someone else able to help us? Airlines are a customer service industry and if you lack the most basic skills to satisfy those that support you there will most definitely be a problem for you in the future. A couple of boarding pass kiosks would have eliminated this whole headache."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,,Frontier is not cheaper. I recently flew American Airlines to Seattle to get my two children and we flew Frontier back to TN. I had no problems at all with American to Seattle. No unexpected fees and charges or hassles at all. You should know that your buck doesn't stop with buying a ticket with Frontier. You must buy your seats and you must pay $50 per any carry on that goes in an overhead or checked at the gate. Even if it fits easily. They are out to squeeze every dime out of you in every way. You must pay for any beverage or snack on board. Not just cocktails and large snacks. They assured us at the gate in Seattle that we would see our baggage in Knoxville. We did not. They're lost and no one knows where they are. I've never written a review to express my dissatisfaction with an airline before but this airline has the worst customer service ever.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Spokane to Denver 18 June. Stormy weather in Denver prevented our flight from landing 3 times so we flew to Colorado Springs to refuel. We had to stay on the plane and only 1 of the 3 lavatories was operational - there was a line of about 30 people waiting to use it. An hour later I was close to the lav and had to sit down again for take-off. We got to Denver 2.5 hours late and my connecting flight to Little Rock had already left. After standing in a long line I found out their next flight to Little Rock wasn't for 2 days. They gave me a ticket to Branson Mo for the next day and I slept on the airport floor. In the morning I exchanged the Branson ticket for a Little Rock ticket for Friday since I didn't have transportation from Branson to Little Rock and got a hotel room for Thursday night. I left Denver Friday evening and got into Little Rock just before 11 pm. My luggage was not there. It had not been in Denver the 2 days I was there. The agent there couldn't get ahold of any of the other airports either. I called the baggage dept at Spokane and twice said they'd call back and haven't. I will not use this airline again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,ILG-MDW 6/1/14 Flight 383. I disagree that the fares are higher once you add in the extras. Who do you think is paying for your extra luggage and soft drinks? You are! Everything is figured into the price and when compared to Southwest I know I saved quite a bit on my recent purchase. The service was timely and professional as well. I give Frontier credit for trying to carve a niche and I predict they will be quite successful as people get educated with regards to what they are doing. Also when fewer people are hauling on oversized luggage and trying to stuff it in the overheads it makes for a smoother and quicker loading and departure from the gate. Ultra low cost carriers like Frontier typically charge $5 extra to carry on a bag versus checking it which effectively eliminates the luggage hoarders trying to board planes with too much luggage which most would admit makes for a slow maddening boarding process. Also if you check/carry 100 lbs. of luggage on other carriers who offer free checked bags and carry-ons who do you think is paying for the extra fuel it takes to transport that? That's right it's you again! It's all built into the ticket price. Again I'd rather pay for what I want and for what I use. I was happy to pay a bit extra for leg room but not for everyone else's extra baggage. I'd rather bring my own bottled water than pay for all the soda and peanuts that everyone else drinks. I'm happy with the experience and will be trying this more often. On very short trips I can make due with a personal sized item and not even have to pay any luggage fees whatsoever! It's a win-win once we all better understand the concept.

Denver CO (DEN) - St. Louis MO (STL) Economy Class Airbus A319 13 June Flight #138. I thought all airlines were about the same but Frontier takes cheap and greedy to a whole new level. I was amazed. 1st carry on bags were 35$ each. Nothing free on beverage cart except cups of water. Attendants just average but the service people at Denver and Seattle were downright rude! We arrived 2 hrs early at check in but no clerks w/long lines then plane arrived 1/2 hr late. When we boarded taxied to flight line then had to go back to gate because of equipment failure so we were an hr and a half late leaving Seattle but they did hold our connecting flight because it was late also. Don't fly w/ them!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,,I flew Frontier for the first and last time this past week. I had a business trip and this was the most cost effective airline for me. First my luggage is a rolling carry on that is the appropriate size and fits in any other airline. Frontier forces you to stick it in a sized up box at the counter to be approved to get the carry on onto the flight and that is for each connecting flight. It's difficult to fit in and I noticed a few people who were charged $50 per bag to have it checked because it did not fit. I lucked out but had to go through the ordeal all over again at my connecting flight in Denver and was told my bag would not fit when it did just a few hours earlier. On my 1st flight the passenger in front was in a broken seat and the stewardess continued to scold him to pull his seat forward for landing/takeoff when he repeatedly explained to her they finally comprehended to get a maintenance person on the flight who did not even fix the seat. I could go on and on but the points above are the biggest red flags and disappointments. Each flight was worse than the previous.

They were told in Denver that they could not board after having flown from MCI until they paid additional ""baggage"" fee in the amount of $100.00 for the two small carryon bags that they had. That is one bag each. My daughters were very upset as they had little cash with them and no credit cards. This is a form of extortion as far as I am concerned. I prepaid for their flights with the understanding that this was all paid for. Why would you sell a ticket and not figure that there would be any baggage?"

There was no notification of such a cancellation even when we arrived at the airport the monitors still said 'On Time'. There were over 100 people in line at the ticketing counter and only 2 agents at the desk. Hold time on the phone was over 30 mins. Frontier could not get us out that day and we had to be rescheduled for the next day. When I discussed the no notification of cancelled flight one customer relations person told me they didn't know why I didn't receive a notification later another told me that Frontier no longer does flight updates. Arrived at airport at 4.35am on 6/15/14 for 6.10am flight and there were over 50 people in line to check bags and no one showed up to work the Frontier counter until 5.00am!

,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,2,no,1,DTW-TTN-DTW. Outbound flight was delayed by weather 4+ hours. Not Frontier's fault but once onboard we were charged $1.99 for lukewarm coffee: is it expecting too much to get freebies after such a long delay? Apparently so. But my main gripe is their carry-on policy. It appears based on our experience both ways that after a certain number of passengers have boarded they simply assume the overheads are full and require people to pay extra to check their carry-ons. This happened to us and when we stopped arguing and got on board the overheads were nowhere near full. That's a $50 hit each way.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,"First time flying Frontier instead of Southwest and was very disappointed! Not only do they charge you for checking a bag but also for any carry-on and they charge you to sit with your party. The check in process is inefficient and slow the staff are not nice. Once on the flight there is a charge for any beverages and snacks but water is free! They then try and convince you to sign up for their credit card wit their on-board ""deal"" and awkwardly try and explain why it is a good idea.

My first around trip flight on Frontier I was sceptical. From the moment I entered the Frontier gate area CVG to Denver flight onboard during the flight and the landing all aspects of the experience was professional. The aircraft's were clean flight crew were making every effort to accommodate the passengers. My return flight was also the same. I would utilize Frontier for my flight service and recommend to others. My one complaint was the long wait for phone service the wait was 20-25 minutes. I feel that's far too long.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Four of us travelled from Philadelphia to Cancun on May 29 2014 flight 19 at 7.15 am. I was not allowed to take my carry-on bag onto the plane unless I paid $50. My other choice was to have them check it for $25 so two of us paid additional $50 for small carry-on bags. The other couple was not charged any money for their carry-on bags with the same customer service representative. My request to speak with supervisor was ignored. The customer service personnel could not have been ruder. On return flight from Cancun to Philadelphia on June 8 2014 we did not have any charges for the same carry-on bags. I will never look at Frontier again when booking a trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,What was once a decent airline is now beyond a nightmare. The new baggage policies are ridiculous. They are taking no frills to new limits and despite the few bucks you save on the ticket price you will end up paying more than competitors in the long run after $2 water charge $50 carry on charge (for the first carry on) and have a poor experience. Customer service if you can even get it is awful. On the phone from a gate agent etc. this airline is almost primitive now. Very disappointing. I will never choose to fly with Frontier again. The one upside is that the flight attendants were courteous and professional.
,,,,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,May 31st 2014 from Denver to Orlando flight 678 return June 6 2014 flight 677. We booked our trip through our travel agent months before these new carry on charges went into effect. We were told we would not have to pay the extra fees. As we arrived at Denver airport and proceeded to the Frontier check in counter we were told we had to pay for our carry ons all of which could fit under the seats we explained what we were told and the check-in guy looked up our booking date and all was fine not the case at the Orlando airport on the way home. We asked for our check in bag back and since we still had 7 lbs allowed in that bag before they added another $75 we started to unpack bags and re-pack so as not to give them one dime more. Needless to say after all the rearranging which was totally unnecessary we were allowed to take our carry on bags as personal items. As I said before we did not have to use the carry on overhead compartments all the bags were so small they fit under the seats with no problem at all. After arriving at the gate we heard several stories like ours. There were so many upset people saying they will never fly Frontier again. It's not just about the money but it's about how you are treated.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,Achieved what they offered. TTN-RSW. First flight out. On time boarding departure and landing (a few minutes early). Crowded plane and they checked the size of my personal item 2x. I had to take out a few items (stuffed in my pocket to make it fit) but overall uneventful journey. I can't speak for service as I slept the entire flight and deboarding was uneventful. I faintly remember the offer for water. Seat pitch normal - I didn't pre-assign seat so was in 2nd to last row but had an empty seat next to me. I'm aware Frontier gets a bad-rap due to its fees but if you know what you are getting into I don't see the issue as it is still cheaper vs flying/parking at PHL or EWR for same route.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Flt 232 from Denver to Nashville 06/04. The ticket was not much cheaper than on Southwest. My computer travel system booked it because it was cheaper but it did not figure in the extra $20 for a checked bag and $30 for the carry on bag. Then they charged for a drink and snack! Charged for watching TV yes you have to use your own phone ipad or laptop but it is free. Plus if you want to select you seat in advance it is from $8 to $15 extra. This will be the last time I fly on Frontier.
,,,,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,"After a revolting experience on a Frontier Flight from MCO to DEN we bit the bullet and flew DEN to SLC May 21 (noon). What a difference! Wonderful stewards on board friendly helpful welcoming. Still cannot believe how rude people are when told that their huge bag cannot fit in the overhead just check the damn thing! Saves a few dollars boarding time too but it is funny to watch people unpacking their overhead bag and trying to put all items in their large ""handbag"" then try to hide their now just as big handbag."
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Scheduled to fly Frontier 902 ATL to TTN today. Flight canceled without notification or explanation. Next flight offering to TTN was in 5 days! Frontier refused to assist with rebooking on an alternate airline. Offered only refund or hotel voucher. Customer service offered no other assistance. I was left on my own to book same day out of ATL on Memorial holiday (to PHL requiring trains and cab to reach my car at TTN airport). Very expensive out-of-pocket.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,I've flown from Harrisburg PA to Orlando FL and back a few times in the past year. Most of the time it was a good experience. One flight which I booked way in advance in the snow season had more than 3 hour delay and I would have missed my appointment so there was no longer a need to fly. I got a refund for which I was thankful. One flight had comedian flight attendants giving the on board preflight information (buckle up etc) that were actually funny. All flights were nonstop from PA to FL which was so nice. The rates were great for an average wage earner like me which was my main reason for choosing Frontier. Now I'm booking 3 tickets for my family and my total bill will be less than I would pay for one ticket with the other major airline flying out of MDT.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Arrived at airport 2.5 hours before flight. No one was at the ticket counter despite a line of about 50 people. Shorter line of about 12 at Kiosk but they were having trouble so the line was slow. After finally getting to the kiosk had trouble getting it to work. (Like the others before me.) When it finally did start working I started pressing the continues until I realised that I had just input that I had no carry on. No way to back up so I printed the ticket and got in the line waiting for the ticket counter. After I finally got through all this I got to the gate just in time to board. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,Booked a cruise for the family in Alaska and we were hoping to fly Frontier from ATL to AK but when we got to the airport the airline said flight was delayed for 3 hours. Not a big deal but since we were connected through Denver we would miss our connecting flight. Also happens before not a big deal. The big deal was we would have to lay over in Denver for 2 days. We ended up being able to book a flight on Delta for twice as much and now the nightmare of trying to find out how to get linked up with our ship. Airline was very rude dismissive and well trained in saying sorry. Which is appropriate since this airline is very very sorry all around. Great to book if you don't care much about getting to your destination. Also don't be fooled by the prices. They charge you for both your checked and carry on luggage. They are a complete waste of time and money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I have flown this airline many times. I saw all the bad reviews and thought while everyone vents when they are frustrated very few take the time to praise when they are satisfied. So here is a satisfied customer. My one wish would be service to Boston or Manchester.
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,They cancelled our flight from Orlando to Wilmington at the last minute saying the plane did not ever leave Denver. They said maybe they could get us on a flight in 3 days! They would not help even help us find another airline to fly. They just gave us a business card with a 1-800-432-1359 number on it. This had a 67 minute wait time. We had to pay top dollar at US Air to get to a city close to Wilmington.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Hands down worst customer service of any airline/company. I first attempted to call their customer service line to resolve my problem and everytime I called there was a 45+ minute wait so I emailed instead. Keep in mind it takes them 3-4 days to respond to emails (which I find unacceptable) so I tried to work it out with them for a few weeks. Following my initial complaint the customer service rep went in and deleted all my airline miles I had accumulated seeing as how my initial contact with them was resolving and issue on using them. Second they didn't even bother to tell me they deleted the miles they tried to play me for being ignorant and said I had no miles. Three weeks of battling with them they have restored part of my points and refuse to assist with my initial issue of using the points. Absolutely worst customer service ever!
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,,,1,no,1,We will not fly with Frontier again. After having paid for tickets for our trip to Costa Rica months in advance we were informed at the gate that our flight was delayed but the check in agent said that we should still be able to make our connecting flight through Denver. So we check our bags ($50 for 2) and go through security. Upon arrival at the gate we were told that we would arrive in Denver at 11:55 p.m. which was the departure time for our connecting flight to Costa Rica. We asked if they would be able to hold the plan for 10 minutes so that we and the 3-4 other passengers who were in the same situation could make the flight. The gate agent said that she had called the staff in Denver and they refused to hold the flight as it would further increase delays. Frustrated we asked to be put on the next flight hoping we could leave the following day at the latest but she told us that the next flight with available seats was in 6 days. We asked to speak to her manager who essentially said that out options were to wait six days or that she could (reluctantly) refund us for the cost of our original flight and book a new flight through a different airline. We had to research flights on our own as they had no intentions of helping us secure seats on a new flight. We ended up paying an additional $400 to book last minute tickets on American Airlines waiting for her to process our refund and get our mailing address to send our checked baggage fee back to us via mail and then rushing to the next terminal to go through security again and catch our flight. Ultimately we paid more than we would have if we'd just booked through American months ago. Plus the lack of customer service or care regarding out situation was infuriating. We are waiting for our flight to Costa Rica as I type this and just praying that they successfully rerouted our bags. Overall a terrible first experience with this airline and we didn't even make it on the plane.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I don't understand the negative reviews. Seating was good. Comfortable seats didn't feel crowded. Entertainment for $4 you get to watch Direct TV. It is free until the flight takes off. If you are really concerned about $4 then I don't know what to say. There were about 30 channels available.

,,,,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Our flight from Seattle to Branson and back was the worst experience ever. I felt at each terminal that it was their first day in business and they had not worked the bugs out of the system. All the employees seem to be angry about something poor morale and no idea of what customer service is all about. The only good thing about this trip was leaving the Branson airport my wife and I arrived there early no Frontier people there however a Southwest agent checked us in and we had absolutely no problems.
,,,,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,,Frontier was delayed 120 minutes from new Orleans to Denver for weather in Denver. We were informed all our connecting flights would be delayed and that we would make our connections not to worry. Upon arriving in Denver many passenger's as well as myself learned our flight connections had left. Many appeared to have been delayed 10 minutes or so clearly not inline with the info provided by new Orleans staff Frontier offered to put me on another flight at 4pm the following day and we could sleep in the airport. No other options nor recommendations for other airlines were provided. My husband searched with me and we purchased a one way ticket from Denver to Salt Lake to get home that night. My family will do whatever we can in the future not to fly Frontier Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,After reading all of the negative comments on this site I wanted to give some positive information. Most people only write a review when they are unhappy and don't take the time when it is a good experience. We flew from Milwaukee to Denver and then Las Vegas. Everything went very smoothly. All flights were on time. If you don't take time to read all of the rules then be prepared for being unhappy. I checked out everything beforehand and didn't have any surprises. The nice thing about the carry on bag requirement is that it eliminates people from bringing hugs bags on and trying to stuff them in the overhead bins. By limiting this and have the airline actually follow the rules they have makes for everyone getting on the plane and seated so much faster.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,,,3,no,1,"I chose to fly with Frontier because of their low prices. I was not aware that this meant I was sacrificing any type of customer service. I booked a flight from CVG I had not received the online check in email and was not at a place where I had access to a printer so thought it would be easy enough to check in at the counter. This was incorrect there was no kiosk and the line was quite long with several people ahead of me checking bags. Although it was not mentioned in any of my emails Frontier seems to have a strict policy that they will not check you in if your flight is 45 mins or less to boarding. Although we were all in line within this time frame due to the slow movement several of us were not at the counter 45 minutes before our flight. This was handled by one lady looking up at us and saying ""no they are cut off"" and no more. We were all very confused and asked what was going on we needed to check in and she ignored us. There were 3 people at the counter and four in line but they would not respond to us at all just completely ignored us and would not explain what was going on until a fourth attendant came up and asked how she could help. This is a frustrating experience no matter what but to just be ignored like that was one of the rudest ways these staff members could have handled it. I do not plan to continue to fly with Frontier even if does save me a few dollars because people should not be treated that way."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"I will never fly with Frontier again. I was in a rush trying to find flights to make it back home before my grandfather passed away and found some tickets through Orbitz. We were supposed to fly out the next morning at 6.15am. I checked in early online and printed out boarding passes. When we got to MSP we were an hour early. There was no one at the bag check counter so we proceeded to go through security and were told our passes didn't work. We were directed back to the counter to get new passes but by this point we were beyond the 45 minute window and couldn't speak to anyone. While I was on the phone with Frontier explaining what happened they said we had to pay the $100 fee per person to get our flight changed to the next available flight. As I was on the phone they came on the intercom calling our names but we couldn't get through security. We then spent 8 hours in front of the baggage check before we could check our bags and go through security. After being nickled and dimed for every fee they could possibly come up with they have the nerve to say ""you booked on a third party website and can't sit together""."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,,"I do not plan on flying Frontier again. Cannot confirm seats prior to check-in unless you pay however no one explains this. Thus my husband 3 year old and I were all seated in different parts of the plane. Even when I paid to check in early on my return we still were separated. Everything is an additional charge. I would rather pay one price and know that I can have a confirmed seat can carry on a bag and can have one cold beverage on my flight. Flight attendants sit in the back of the plane and read a book. Not sure what the point is in having them. I booked with Amex points (a ""third party"") thus carry on luggage is extra. Pretty much everyone in our line had booked through a ""third party"" so we were all in the same boat. They make everyone have their carry on bag measured which was one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. This created chaos in the waiting area as multiple lines had formed and half the people didn't know what was going on."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,1,no,,We left from Omaha and after checking in going through security and getting to our gate we were told to wait in line to put our carry ons and personal items in a slot to see if we would be charged. Very rude same thing happened changing plans in Denver. Leaving Las Vegas at 6.30am told to pay $50 for carry-on I said we didn't on the way out and she said we are a 3rd party and that is how it goes. Wait through a very long security line sit down and again they told us to wait in a very long line to check to see if everyone's carry-on fitted into the slot. I have MS and lines and standing are not the best for me but myself and my husband do what we are told. Never once was there a problem. Staff were not friendly. I travel 12 to 15 times a year for work and have never had to do any of this. Then they come through with the snack and beverage cart and tell you sorry your drink is $1.99. We have never been treated like lower class on any flight business or pleasure. I can assure you we will not save $20 for a flight and go through Frontier ever again. I know everyone wants cut backs but they may want to look at customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"Never mind how 100% of everything (drinks food checking baggage) is ""available for a fee"" I understand that is a way to save me some money. What makes this airline the worst experience I have ever had traveling is the fact my flight was delayed - I understand that happens - but that made it so they could not get me on my connecting flight home. They cannot get another flight on their airline for another 2 days. They refuse to help me at the desk I call their customer service line on my own personal phone which took several hours for them to tell me they will not help me get on another airline. I have to stay at the airport for 2 days. Not even an upgraded seat. I saved a little money on Frontier tickets and they are costing me hundreds of dollars. I will never consider giving them my business again."
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,Poor inflexible service. If you don't have your boarding pass printed before you get to the airport you might miss your flight. Their machine shut off 45 min before the flight and they don't staff their counters. 30 min on the phone and they were still inflexible. Couldn't rebook flight until 4 days out. Don't use this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,5,SEA to OKC round trip 4/10/2014 coming home on 4/14. I made sure I checked all their rules checked one golf bag online saved 5 dollars each way. Plane was not as clean as would like. Just an uneventful trip with no snags. the Denver to SEA connection was very close time wise. If you do your homework and plan you can save money flying with them. I would fly them again.
,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,My wife and I flew from SEATAC to Midway near Chicago with a stop in Denver. This was round-trip so there were four flights in all. Not one flight left on time. You would think the law of probably would ensure that at least one flight would be on schedule but that was not so. We flew classic plus so we had one free checked bag one free carry-on and a free drink during the flight. I feel sorry for those that had to pay for those things. When did we have to start paying extra for customer service? Since you have to pay extra for everything everybody tries to make all their luggage carry-on. This slowed down the boarding process and only made the whole experience worse. Everything but the seat you were sitting in was extra and it seems that if federal guidelines would allow them to pack more people onto a plane by doing away with the seats they would do that too! The flight attendants were courteous to your face but since we sat in the front right next to them we could overhear them talking about passengers in the back and previous passengers on other flights. Very unprofessional. I would not recommend this airline to anyone expecting a decent experience. If you don't mind being treated like you are cattle being led to slaughter then this airline is for you. I wouldn't fly Frontier again no matter how low the fare is.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,I fly all the time and try to fly Frontier if at all possible that is until tonight. I won't be flying them anymore. Flying Denver to Kansas City originally leaving at 7.15. After three gate changes our flight is delayed over 2 hours. Funny thing is there is a later Frontier flight flying to Kansas City and they are boarding now. Everyone is asking why Frontier wouldn't switch planes so earlier flight could leave first. We aren't only people affected either Frontier is moving everyone gate to gate and there are delays galore.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,I fly a lot for business and must check a bag for tools. My selected seats (non premium) were rejected at check in and random seats were assigned. I expected baggage fees for checked baggage but my briefcase was large enough to qualify as a carry on instead of a personal item. Sizing explanation was not available until the rate increased from $50 to $100. Random seat assignment always means middle seat assignment. My return flight was not as booked but this may be my travel agent. By the time all of the surprise fees were added I could have flown another carrier for less. They would be better named hidden fee or bait and switch airlines. Alaska Delta and United would be better choices for routes in the Northwest and West. I didn't eat or drink on the flight but n/a is not a review option so I chose no opinion. The flight crew was professional and genial the check in staff was bright and chipper but unhelpful.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew PHX-DEN on 3/27 for $90 a person during spring break. Flight was on time boarding quick and organized except for the carry on bag size check which was very unorganized at boarding. Flight attendants gave out water for free and on a 1.5 hr flight food and drink purchases weren't needed. Checked bag was out before we even got to the baggage claim belt. All in all a very positive experience and highly recommend Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I was penalized because I booked my flight through Orbitz. I had to pay for seats - $8 a piece so that I could sit with my kids. The airlines nickel and dimes you - you pay to carry on or to check a bag. I ended up paying $80 each direction to check 4 bags for my family. Then they give you no beverages for free on the flight - a 4hr flight and you have to pay $2 for a coffee or soda! Finally - their computer system could not let us check in online - because my husband and son share the same full name - one is Jr the other is III. I have never had a problem with this on any other airline. Frontier told me I should have booked their tickets separately.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,,,5,yes,7,Denver-Orlando and return: March 18-24 (FFT678/FFT681). If you know what you are getting into with this airline it's not half bad. I researched and knew Frontier charges for carry-ons if you don't meet the requirements or book a fare on their website so I made sure to bring a proper sized bag and got on no problem. I do the same thing when I fly Spirit. The customer service wasn't very good in Denver but once on the plane the flight attendants were very nice and helpful especially when my TV broke and the customer service in Orlando was noticeably better. The flight on the way out was delayed due to snow and wind but I can't fault Frontier. Overall an enjoyable experience and considering they have TV (yes they charge but so do most others) I did my research and they were nearly $200 cheaper than the nearest non-stop competitor I would certainly would continue flying them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Des Moines to Las Vegas March 24 2014 and return on March 27 2014. One of the legs was flight 782 on March 27th. They reel you in with a low fare and then nickel and dime you to death. As a business traveler I'll steer clear of this airline from this point forward.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"Flight 667 March 7 2014 Cleveland to San Francisco. My 19 year old daughter booked a flight in early March and had two small carry on bags. When she checked in no one at Frontier mentioned anything about a charge for a second carry on. When she got to the gate they told her she needed to pay $100 for the second carry on. She offered to check-in the second small bag and was told ""no we have to charge you $100."" She ended up having to check the bag anyway but they still charged her $100."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,2,no,2,I flew from Denver to San Diego on 8.59pm flight. We did not board until 9.20pm and started to taxi but returned to the gate due to the plane had a malfunction with one engine. We didn't taxi for another 20 minutes which all of this caused a serious delay! All of these events seemed to be a disorganization on Frontiers' behalf. After all of this confusion and frustration Frontier employees acted as if they did passengers a favor. No compensation was awarded i.e. beverages or anything. On top of this distraction I landed late causing my rental car reservation to be cancelled and had to barter with taxi drivers for transportation to my hotel. As far as I'm concerned this airline has the worst customer service bar none!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I have flown Frontier before and thought that for the price it was a good option. However I suppose it had been longer than I remember since I experienced Frontier. I was told that my carry on was too big (I have taken it on every flight for years including Frontier) and that I had to check it. Then I was told that whether I checked the bag or carried it on that I would be charged an extra fee! I specifically travel light to avoid fees and baggage mix ups. I actually drive an extra hour to get to an airport that includes Frontier so that I can get a good deal. Never again. I hate to say this as I am a working person myself and don't quickly complain about service but unfortunately the Frontier employees were plain rude. I can almost overlook this since I would be frustrated with all the angry customers if I had to deal with them too. Frontier doesn't seem to care about the passengers anymore.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,March 3 2014 – Flight F9 395 ILG–DEN. March 5 2014 – Flight F9 396 DEN–ILG. Thank you Frontier for my recent ILG–DEN flight coincidently on the Alberta Clipper and Polar Bear tail ID. The New Castle (Wilmington DE) Airport was pretty much the only game in town during the March 3 snowstorm. Nearby Philadelphia Airport was all but closed. This was true for earlier snowstorms too. Our flight was delayed about an hour due to de-icing issues not the airline’s fault. This little airport has all the charm of a Soviet-era military installation but I’ll gladly forego shopping mall ambience for short lines free parking easy access and cheap flights. I carried-on so can't comment on baggage. Service was comparable to other low-cost domestic carriers. Return DEN-ILG was delayed about 20 minutes. Their Mediterranean Sky Snacks Box was purchased for $7 and it was ample tasty and good value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,,,2,no,,I used to be a big fan of Frontier but no more. Three of us travelled from DFW to SLC for spring break. Much to my surprise I was not allowed to take my carry-on bag onto the plane unless I paid $100. My other choice was to have them check it for $35 more than if I had checked it in initially. The gate personnel could not have been ruder. I will never look at Frontier again when booking a trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,My husband lives in Chicago and I live in the Northeast. One of us flies every two weeks. We use Frontier on a regular basis and while I think they can improve on the carry on bag size checking process other than that we've both been more than impressed with the low fares and clean safe planes. The flight crew are funny and make the trip seem quick.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,,This was my first and last flight with Frontier. We arrived at DIA with plenty enough time to drop off our bags and make it in time to the gate for departure. However when we tried to print our already completed boarding passes and drop off our bags the computer directed us to go directly to the gate. The only option we were given was to re-book a later flight at a cost of $100 per person (5). We were not treated properly and can only anticipate how we will be treated once we actually get on the next flight. I already do not like the cost to pick a seat and the cost to bring luggage and will try to stick with Southwest for future flights. Judging from the other posts it is clear Frontier has a serious PR problem and doesn't care about customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,"2013 Christmas Vacation from Atlanta Georgia to Trenton New Jersey. I found a ticket within my budget and booking the ticket was easy. Boarding was done quickly and very organized. The stewardesses were kind and very helpful to passengers. The only difficulty I experienced was with the ticket checker upon boarding in Atlanta after I learned that my bag wasn't within standard regulations to be a carry on. This one young lady was very rude and short with me. She took no time at all to explain to me the steps that I needed to take to secure my bag from the gate. Her only reply was ""You're not getting on this plane."" I was quite taken back by her rudeness. However as quickly as she had insulted me another young lady at the desk came to my rescue and she was very helpful and polite. I was able to check my bag and board my flight without further incident. The plane was clean and the flight was quiet and friendly."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My husband and I got to the airport to discover that the flight had been delayed 10 hours. There was only one person behind the desk to re-route an entire plane of people. We got in line and the line had barely moved in 2 hours. I called Frontier was told that the next time we could get out to our destination was 5 days from then. I then went to the American Airlines counter-they said if Frontier was willing to release the first half of our tickets they would be glad to honor them. I called Frontier and they refused. When I tried to reschedule the return date for 5 days later the agent said they would do that but we would have to pay 100$ each for a rebooking fee. Everyone in line had horror stories about Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Orlando to Denver. First and last time I will fly with Frontier. Very rude and disrespectful flight attendants. They were the most unprofessional crew I have seen. They treated everybody like they were doing them a favor. They simply don't realize that customers pay their wages. It's just not worth it.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,This was my first and last experience with Frontier Airlines. I bought my ticket not directly from Frontier Airlines and found they treat these tickets as if you are an inferior customer. I paid to check in my luggage and not one word was mentioned about my carry on I proceeded to the gate and was told I had to pay $100 to get on with my carry on bag. I travel often and have never had to pay for a carry on. The gate agent had terrible customer service and when I finally made it on the plane everyone around me was also complaining about the horrible customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,,The first time I have used Frontier and it will be the last. Everything was fine until I was boarding and then they said that my ticket didn't say carry on.I had to walk to the check in desk which was about 20 feet away and tell them. This is when I was told that I needed to pay $100. After that shock and paying the money they then told me to carry my bag and go ahead and get on the plane. On my return flight I made sure that I told the check in attendant that I had a carry on and needed to have it on my ticket so I wouldn't have to pay 100 more dollars. She then said my bag was too big and would have to be checked. I have used this bag for many flights and never has it been to big for carry on. It is the standard size approved for airline carry on. Worst airline I have flown.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Our flight was cancelled due to the recent snow was told since we didn't buy our ticket from them we have no travel options to get rebooked. Now on my 3rd day of standby. Everyone I have dealt with has been rude and gives conflicting advice. We were offered another flight in a week or money back. Problem is this is a family vacation now with lost rental car lost ski condo etc. no offer to switch airlines or rebook as things settled out from storm. No offers to get others to give up their seats. Never seen anything like it.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Flight 668 and 678 on Feb 4 2014. Tries to charge you for every little thing. Who ever heard of charging for carry-on baggage? As if it costs them anything for me to drag on my own suitcase hoist it up to the overhead compartment and then lug it back down! Why do they charge so I can pick my seats? $1.95 for a Coke? There was no airsick bag when I started feeling nauseous. Luckily the stewardess got a plastic bag to me on time but how many times does someone have to wait 5-10 minutes for a stewardess to show up and no one does? Finally they spend half the flight trying to get me to buy a frequent flyer credit card. I'd rather drive.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,I wish I had read these before booking. We booked our flight through another site so had to pay for bags (the only way we knew about the flight was because of the other site you would think they would be glad for the business) travelled with children could not sit together ended up in middle seats throughout the plane. We arrived at our initial airport on time but the incoming flight was late so we got in late to Denver they let us off the plane to try to make it we ran to the gate to be told (with 10 other passengers) that they released the plane. We were four minutes late apparently that was the one flight that could not be late we were trying to make a reception that night in SLC so had few other options. Customer service was the worst I have experienced in 40+years several different people sat at the counters without acknowledging customers when they did talk to us they were extremely rude acted inconvenienced by customers. We've flown 4 airlines this year this was our first and last for Frontier. Awful not worth the cheap tickets we got nickel and dimed and treated unprofessionally.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,,"I caught a Frontier Airlines flight from San Francisco to Denver CO then from Denver to Cincinnati on Feb 5th 2014. The airfare is reasonable but I was surprised to learn that you cannot choose a seat in advance I was charged $50 for a carryon luggage plus another $25 for a ""preferred seat"". The agent at the gate later explained to me that I had a ""basic"" ticket which does not afford passengers with similar benefits than those who book their flights through Frontier AL website. Another surprise is they charge passengers to watch onboard Direct TV ($5.95) plus $1.95/standard beverage such as Pepsi products coffee etc."
,,,,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,1,Another awful experience by this the worst of US carriers. Flew IAH-DEN one way only good part was that the ticket was cheap and flight left on time. Previous flights all delayed by at least an hour. Crew were surly and rude and didn't want to be there. One attendant barked at passengers to not put bags in the overhead unless it was their row (never heard that before). Another yelled at me for keeping my Iphone on during taxiing which is allowed by every other airline now (TSA/FAA have change the rules). Worst part is they charge you for a can of soda ($2) and make a big deal about giving you the whole can!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,4,no,,Flew Frontier for first and last time to Nashville-Phoenix. Connecting flight delayed 45 minutes due to mechanical problem with door. Return trip: Phoenix-Denver flight ok. Flight from Denver to Nashville took off and had to return to Denver (plane landing gear unable to retract). In both situations staff had very poor communication informing passengers of situation. Rudest flight attendants I have experienced. No compensation for inconvenience or lost time due to delays. Frontier is an economy airline I get it. They want to charge you for anything/everything they can. Baggage food and beverages.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Just did a round trip from Salt Lake to Orlando changing in Denver. We had pre chosen seats on Orbitz we arrived and had been separated for our flights what would posses a company to charge for a carry on I paid $20 for a checked bag and then was stiffed for $25 for a carry on. But here is the good part when boarding in Denver from Salt Lake the plane was late so we had to rush to the next and was treated horrible by the flight attendant saying we couldn't come on late and expect a place for our carry on (the one I paid $25 for). No complimentary snacks or beverages.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,"I booked a flight on Frontier for my parents on Oribz.com. Their whole Frontier Airlines experience was a disaster. The Frontier employees told my parents that because they booked on through a third party that their seat assignments would not be honored. My senior citizen parents were crammed in the last row by the bathrooms and made to feel like it was their fault because of where they bought their tickets. They were not seated together. They were surprised to find out upon check in that carry on bags are not free even though the Frontier website chart says that ""Economy"" tickets are free. They came to learn that this is only if you book directly through Frontier. Very misleading. They had to pay $50 to take their carry on. The gate attendants were rude. My parents arrived early for their return flight and were made to feel stupid for getting there 2.5 hours early. The gate attendant told them to just sit there and ""someone will be around at some point"". So tricky baggage fees rude employees and being treated like you in trouble because you bought your ticket off Orbitz all equal one bad experience and the fact that our family will never fly Frontier again."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My wife and daughter flew out the day after Christmas (2013) and arrived 2 hours prior to boarding as recommended. Much to our surprise the line to check baggage was extremely long compared to what the other airlines were experiencing. It was apparent that Frontier was under staffed behind the counters so by the time it was our turn to check in the gate was closed for our flight. They did not have an express check in so we were out of luck as this would have helped. Fortunately a relative gave us her miles for my wife and daughter to fly on Delta and after explaining to the Delta representative what had happened they were given priority check in and they were on a flight 3 hours later to their destination. After numerous phone calls with waits of up to 1 1/2 hours Frontier gave us vouchers for the fight that was missed. We have always had great experiences with Frontier over the years but apparently with all the reorganizations buyouts etc.. have lost the customer service they once had.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,10,Traveled from Trenton NJ to Fort Myers week before Thanksgiving. It was one of the most pleasant flights I've had in a long time. They have a small terminal in Trenton not like dealing with Newark. Check-in staff were nice and security was quick. They have a tiny store in the small waiting area to buy snacks/drinks. Plane was about 30 minutes late but once it got there they had us boarded and doors closed in about 15 minutes. They boarded from the middle to front and middle to back - common sense! Flight crew very pleasant. I didn't like the idea you could only purchase drinks or snacks or TV with a credit or debit card no cash. The plane was very clean restrooms spotless flight quiet and comfortable. In Fort Myers I went to the first baggage claim to find my luggage already on the rack. I spent less than five minutes in Fort Myers airport! Return flight was on time and flight crew was also fun. Boarding was organized: first 4 rows then those who had carry-ons that would fit under the seat. I got on then and everyone with bags for overhead got on quickly with much less stress than the Continental flight I took in May. Return flight the same as the first quiet and on time. I had to pay $25 for my luggage each way but not for carry-on. For me this was a great value: $178 round trip and $50 total for baggage. From the comments above some encounter problems with Frontier but it seems to be mostly on connecting flights. I will definitely give Frontier another try as my experience this time was very good!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Our flight was Kansas City to Denver with a connection in Denver to Las Vegas on Mon Jan 6th. Flight scheduled to leave at 6.30am. Flight delayed 4 hours supposedly for mechanical issues. They do not communicate to passengers or update on status. Many people were led to believe they will make connections and waited for info for 2-4 hours to be told they will not make their connecting flight. When we finally arrived in Denver we were told to go to Customer Service to reschedule our connecting flight and waited in excess of 4 hours just to get to the counter. Told that the next flight out would be the next day! Finally we got food vouchers we had been at Frontiers mercy for over 18 hours. After arriving at 3am at Las Vegas airport we had to get our luggage out of impound. From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket purchased through a third-party vendor that our carry-on bag would be $100 per bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverages offered without a charge incurred. The recent addition of fees for everything but use of the bathroom has taken Frontier Airlines to the very bottom of the food chain. Our return flight was no better. We made it on the Las Vegas flight to Denver. When we got to Denver our flight was delayed. Our plane was to leave at 9.13pm. We got food and started back to the terminal and when we got there they wouldn't open the doors to let us on the plane. This was 9.10pm. We were told to go to Customer Service to be rescheduled for another flight. By the time we got down to the Customer Service desk the woman was very rude and said that she couldn't do anything without us paying an additional $100. I paid the money and got a stand-by for 10.12am and a confirmation for a 3pm flight. We spent the next 13 hours sitting at the boarding gate. No where to lay down but on the floor and again our luggage made its way home but we didn't. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Over winter break my family enjoyed a wonderful Skiing vacation in Colorado. My boyfriend and I had to leave the trip early. Because of this we paid a shuttle service to get us to the airport early on Sunday morning. When we got to the airport we saw the Frontier flight was delayed 2 hours. No text no call no email to warn us of this inconvenience. When we got to the gate I politely asked the lady what the problem was weather mechanical or just a delay at the other airport. She told me it was mechanical. With that I asked if we could be compensated for our time in the airport with food vouchers. She replied that the delay was not set in stone and therefore would not reward customers. The flight did not leave for another 3 hours and we were not compensated for any food during that time. I was extremely disappointed and plan to never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I flew from Orlando to Trenton NJ. Flight delayed twice but did take off finally. When the flight arrived in Trenton the pilot announced that the runway was too icy to land. We circled for 45 minutes more they tried to de ice the runway. No success! The pilot announced we would now land in Wilmington Delaware and a representative would meet us and provide hotel accommodations. They kept us on the runway for almost 90 minutes and we were told that they were making accommodations for everyone with hotels. Finally get into the airport and are told that they have no intention of providing of providing hotel accommodation. We sit for almost 90 minutes and are told they hired a bus to transport people. Too icy to land a plane but they felt is was fine to put people on a bus. Airport was closing and they were not offering any other options. Arrived back at Trenton 3.30 am. I will never fly this airline again and I don't care how cheap it is absolutely awful service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,,,1,no,,Kansas City to Denver connection on Mon Jan 6th. Will never book Frontier again. Surprise fees at the gate. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours supposedly for mechanical issues. They do not communicate to passengers or update on status. Many people were led to believe they will make connections and waited for info for 2-4 hours to be told they will not make their connections. Passengers were in a line to schedule alternative flights to find 1 agent to assist them. Then told you will need to call their 800 number. No excuse for that kind of customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,1,"I traveled Frontier to come home from Los Angeles. Frontier has a rule that their ticketing counters open 2 hours prior to departure. Arrived at the LAX ticket counter a little early and had to wait 45 minutes for an agent to check me in. However agents were very nice and got me checked in fine. I flew to Denver from LAX and had no complaints with flight attendants and pilots. My second flight was from Denver (depart at 5pm) to Cleveland. I went up to the agent at the gate to ask a question. He greets me with ""Yo."" I found that to be very unprofessional. We ended up departing at 7pm I have never boarded a plane so slowly. We landed in Cleveland around midnight. It must be a Frontier thing to be understaffed when unloading bags off the aircraft because that was the case. With all of this said I will never be flying Frontier Airlines ever again."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I do not recommend this airline for people traveling between Chicago and Trenton. The primary reason: the lack of any semblance of a contingency plan in the event of weather related travel delays. Our Monday flight home to Chicago was cancelled due to weather (not the airlines fault) however the next available flight was Thursday (3 days later). The announcement was made by an attendant yelling it through the terminal and passengers had to quickly get in line in the hope they would get on the flight. The attitude of the attendants was apathetic and no efforts were made to help customers rebook a different flight. Certainly no notion of adding an additional flight to help customers reach their final destination. There was minimal assistance helping people find transportation from the airport find lodging for the evening and it felt like we were being pushed out the door as everyone was scrambling to change their plans and find a way home. General complaints include: understaffed baggage drop-offs confusing and useless signage extremely slow kiosks. There is a general apathy towards customer service - individual front line employees are generally nice and helpful but there is an evident lack of organization and customer concern. The airfare is cheap but you get what you pay for.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"Was booked on a flight from Tampa - Trenton on 1/3/14. Flight was cancelled about 4 hours prior to departure and I was left stranded without any options. Frontier stated they could not fly me out for another 4 days and refused to put me on another carrier or on their next departing flights stating ""they are already full and you don't have a guaranteed seat"". This is totally unacceptable. I had to spend hours on the phone with other airlines and incur excessive charges to take a last minute flight and change my car return time. Would not recommend this airline if it was the only airline."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"We drove 5 hours out of our way to receive what we thought was a discounted ticket for four traveling to Mexico. $180 later for baggage fees and we should have just booked Delta or United for about the same price. It is a ""hidden"" fee and is not ethical. They specifically ensure that your not aware of the policy. I fly a lot for business and its standard to pay for bags exceeding 40-50 lbs and can also be policy to pay for checked bags (domestic) but I have never heard of having to pay for carry-on baggage that meets their size and weight criteria. If they would have been upfront about it we wouldn't have went through the trouble of ensuring that we were brining four small bags that met their height width length and weight requirements and would have just had two bags and saved ourselves half the cost. Even worse this is on an international flight. I could truthfully not care less about drinks and snacks but a 5 hour flight and they want you to pay for a cup of coffee? I feel as if they should be paying me for the 3 hour delay on each side of my flight that was caused by their incompetence if they are going to nickel and dime their ""customers"" for every last item. Watch out next time you get on a Frontier flight they will probably have a visa machine to gain access to the bathrooms."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,My husband and I are just returning from vacation and are waiting to board our final flight of our journey home to Denver. We arrived at the Frontier ticket counter this morning to find that we could not carry on our bags for free as we had on the way out - today it would cost either $25 to check each bag or $50 to carry them on. This was a sneaky tactic by frontier - very clever to gouge the budget traveler when they believe they have accounted for all costs at the end of their trip. Of course our hands were tied and we had no logical choice but to pay! Wow. My resolution in 2014: no more flights with Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I think Frontier should remove their inclusion on the cheap-fare sites because when you get to the airport you are told that because you bought your ticket on one of these sites you have to pay $55 for your carry-on etc. The departure and return flights were changed and I had to stay five days longer than planned. Also the people using these sites were put in the very back where the seats don't recline. This would all be fine except by the time Frontier gets done with you you might as well have paid regular fare. Every airline I have ever used cheap fare or not will email when the departure time has been changed even by only 5 min. You rescheduled your departure time for 25 min. earlier without letting me know. I was lucky to get to airport in time. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"I'm a Summit member with Frontier and have been for approx 10 years. In short I booked 4 'Classic Plus' seats for myself and family in October and was told that I could not select seats at that time. So exactly 24 hours prior to the flight tried to check in and received 4 seats (none of the 'Classic Plus' variety scattered throughout the plane). These are all middle seats too. I suggest no-one fly Frontier unless you have time to waste (flights are always delayed) travel alone (can't get seats together) and have no baggage (carry on or otherwise). If you are sane and can do the math by the time you book their ""Ultra Low Cost Carrier' fare add in baggage ($50.00 at min) and carry-on ($25.00 at min) you've just paid the same price as United Delta etc. and get to buy your own water."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,3,no,3,We fly Frontier only because it is the only airline that provides direct flights to Madison WI. I would like to admonish everyone not to leave the check-in desk without checking if you received all tickets that you purchased. We wasted 40 minutes with 3 kids under three at the check-in desk checking in our bags. At first the agent was too lazy to carry several credit card transactions for checked in luggage and was saying that she would check in two bags under one passenger's name and another bag under another passenger's name (we had 3 tickets) - we ended up paying $5.00 more which is not a big deal but the agent's attitude was far from professional. After that ordeal we have to return to the check in desk two times as the agent printed only one boarding pass at a time without checking that there three tickets under the same reservation and that happened two times! In addition the crew was out of soap and coffee and by mistake took our bag thinking that it belongs to the crew member. We were happy that it was only a 1.5 hr flight. In general the service was not so bad but little customer service issues ruined the pleasure of having a nice flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,I read other messages on this board and arrived at Denver Airport fearing the worst. At it happened my experience was entirely opposite. My wife and I fly had booked on Frontier understanding that like other low cost airlines (e.g. Air NZ) you get what you pay for. We had never flown Frontier before. We are Americans but have lived overseas (mostly Australia) for several decades and have been consistently amazed when flying in the USA at the huge suitcases that are show-horned into overhead luggage areas supposedly as carry on. Carry on for us elsewhere is an enforced max 7kg (15 lb) and much smaller in size than the Frontier allowance though admittedly at no cost. We had prompt service from a polite and friendly service team who went out of their way to find for us a luggage option that minimised cost and maximised our enjoyment.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,,,2,no,2,Flight 403 from Denver to LAX on 12/18/2013. I am a Denver native and resident and the decline in the quality of this airline is sad to me. It was never a top tier airline in quality but the recent addition of fees for everything but use of the bathroom has taken it to the very bottom. Want to select your own seat? $8. Stretch seating? $20. Carry-on bag? $25 each way. Seltzer water? $3. Oh and today you have to stand in a new separate line where they force you to stuff said $25 carry-on into a sizing box. If you don't they won't allow you to board the plane. The staff is inflexible probably because of the new corporate rules. Two round trip flights in the last month they are my last ever on Frontier.
,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,3,no,3,I bought a classic plus ticket so that I wouldn't have to pay at check in. However if you check in online you still must wait in line (this was in Seattle and OKC) because there is no curbside drop off. You are better off using the kiosk to check in at the airport because you will receive priority for baggage check. They are severely understaffed and use outdated computers and communication systems so everything is super slow for check in. At OKC two of the 3 kiosks weren't working. Of the 4 flight attendant crews that I experienced on this trip one crew was awful and one crew was great. it had been a while since I had flown on Frontier and I'm with other reviewers when I say never again. Unbelievable.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,I've flown Frontier 3 times in the last year. Each experience worse than the prior. They now charge $50 for a carry on bag $25 for a checked bag. Tha last time my seat was taken by another passenger and the flight attendant made me sit between two larger passengers. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,My family and I got to the airport at 5.05 because we dropped our rental at around and 4.40 got the documentation for that one. Now earlier in the day we were notified via email that our 5.45 had been changed to 5.55. Upon trying to check a car seat and a bag which we per paid for at the same time we checked in online more than 3 hours before we were told that could not happen because the time had been changed back to 5.45. I know about the 45 minute cut off time some airports have but it was still showing a departure time of 5.55pm on the departure board and the best part is it didn't even leave until after 6.10. I was given the option to pay 50 dollars more per person for a flight leaving the next day but the wife and I had to work the next day. I basically had to pay $370 to get home. I will pay more to never fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"Very unlikely I will use Frontier again. Three of us flew from NYC to Portland OR on Dec 2 2013. I bought the tickets through a 3rd party so I had no idea they charged for both checked and carry on bags. Frontier is the only airline that charges for carry on bags. I believe these are hidden costs that they're passing on to consumers and that this practice is unlawful. Aren't the airlines required to disclose all costs? Also their system of charges is complex as is the various ""classes"" of customers. I am so annoyed at having to pay an additional $110 for the bags."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,,First of all I looked online and they said first baggage was free. Got there had to pay $25. The flight had to make an emergency landing (I understand things happen). Got a hotel voucher to stay the night and the desk clerk said this happens all the time! Never again. It is taking 22 hrs and 3 flights to get from Houston to Albuquerque!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,,I will never use this airline again. I had no idea that they charge passengers for carry on bags if you use a third party vendor to book your flight. That is not a deal. We observed numerous travelers being advised of this policy at the time of boarding. Also they charge $2 for a small cup of water. Don't use this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"I discovered that they have upped their price for checked baggage and now charge $1.99 for inflight sodas. I then missed my connecting flight due to an error on the counter attendant's part and was charged an additional $50 to change to the next flight. When I calmly explained the situation I was told that I was the only person to miss the flight. She rudely dismissed my further request for a supervisor and demanded payment unless I was ""no longer interested in reaching my final destination."" My traveling is not yet over and I have already encountered further issues with this airline just in one day. I shudder to think what my return trip will be like. Throughout this ordeal I have encountered the same attitude with each Frontier representative. The customer service is absolutely atrocious the employees do not seem to care and I have found that Frontier does not uphold the typical customer service mantra that ""The Customer is Always Right."""
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,We flew Frontier for the first time and it was definitely our last time. I've never heard of an airline that charges for carry on $50 a piece soft drinks $1.99 TV $5.99 and to top it all multiple delays. Customer Service was horrible. One of the check-in agents drove a lady into tears. It was horrible to watch. We also had problems getting seat assigned together but thank you to passengers who were kind enough to switch. Please beware If you book through a third party you will pay for your carry on.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"I was traveling with my wife and booked two tickets together. When we tried to check in (exactly 24 hours before the flight) we couldn't select seats and the seats that Frontier assigned to us weren't together - we were sitting in different sections of the airplane not even anywhere close to each other. At the airport we were told that because we don't have ""status"" we couldn't select seats and they had no obligation to let us sit together. When we protested the Frontier rep told us we should be happy that we have a confirmed seat at all. Apparently Frontier has a new policy to specifically not let passengers who travel together sit together so they can split them up and stick them in middle seats. This lets them charge extra for aisle and window seats or just entirely reserve them for their ""elite"" passengers. Do not fly Frontier. They don't notify you when you buy your ticket that your party will not sit together. On top of that they nickel-and-dime passengers at every step. You want to choose a seat? You have to pay. You want a soft drink during the flight? That will be $1.99. Want to use the TV screen? $3.99. Oh and if you buy a ticket via another website (instead of Frontier's website) they will charge you $100 for your carry-on bag. I think the next logical step for Frontier is to start charging for using the lavatory for reclining your seat and for using the reading light."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"SAN-DEN. Online booking was horrible - Select outbound flight select return flight change return flight. Frontier then changes your outbound flight to the first one available (the wrong one). Call to change with 48 minute hold time. Called the next day to change (only 28 minutes wait!) Charge to change the flight $150/person. So for the cost of a round trip flight my wife and I were charged to select the correct flight that Frontier erroneously picked for us. Pros: None. Cons: customer service has excessive hold times. Cost to change a flight not commensurate with the cost of the flight/available flights. Frontier refused to admit their website was faulty. Do not fly Frontier. Unless you like ""saving"" $50/flight and then giving it back for checked bags carry- on bag and a drink of water. Same business model as Spirit - cheap flight but not worth it at all."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"This is the first time I've flown Frontier and it will be the last. Want something to drink? $2. They will give you one glass of water for free. Want something to eat? $6. Want to bring a carry-on? $25. Want enough legroom to fit your legs between your seat and the seat in front of you? That will be $5 $15 $25 or $50. Want to watch TV? $6. Want to check in online? Good luck - said I had to check in at the airport. I even went to the airport to check in and at 8.05 the attendant said ""sorry closed at 8pm come back tomorrow."""
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I booked through 3rd party which prohibits you from choosing a seat at all and no confirmation until 24 hours before. Used the mobile application to check in terrible application to say the least and no paperless option like United. First time I've ever had to pay for a carry on and normally fly United or Southwest. Got to the gate and they made everyone put their bags through a pre-check to make sure bags were the right size. What a hassle for those who travel all the time. Frontier used to be a good airline but they're just making it difficult for customers to travel with them. This is the last time I will ever fly with this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,2,no,2,I was a loyal Frontier Airlines customer for forty years. Not any more. I will not fly Frontier again if I can avoid it. Just as others have posted here the customer service is terrible they will charge you outrageous fees wherever they can and the flights are not on time. Avoid this airline if you can. I fly other airlines quite frequently for business. American United Delta Southwest and US Airways all do a much better job.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,2,I live in Colorado and have used them for years. They were a great airline until they were bought by Republic a while back. The latest purchase by the owner of Spirit Airlines has gutted the airline I liked so much. Just spent 10 minutes waiting in line to measure my carry on bag. This is my 4th flight with them this year. In the future I will use United Southwest or Delta.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,,This airline not only charges for checked baggage but also your carry on. If you pay for it prior to going to the gate its $50 a bag and $100 at the gate. I fly 75 flights a year on various airlines this is the first flight I have flown on frontier and will be the last myself or any other employee in my company will fly on Frontier Airlines. I knew their business practice was to underpay their employees which will lead to terrible customer service so I should have been surprised that they would nickle and dime their customers. Avoid.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,yes,5,My flights were excellent however on the Denver to KC flight I was charged $50 for my carry-on bag. This was surprising since I had already paid $25 in Kansas before leaving. In Palm Desert I was not charged at all. It was a little confusing.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"I purchased a Frontier ticket from Minneapolis to San Francisco through Orbitz. Frontier changed my departure light from a 10.45am to 6am flight leaving me with a 5 hour layover and necessitated getting up early and driving myself to the airport (paying for parking). Frontier repeatedly admitted they did not inform me of this significant change in flights. I discovered the change during check-in the night before and called Orbitz. Orbitz tried to rebook me but said Frontier refused to adjust my flights. I then paid $25 to carry on my own bag and they demanded I check it instead. When I asked for a plastic bag to put some things in they laughed refused and told me ""that's why you have hands."" On arrival in Denver I found there was another Frontier flight leaving for SFO in 45 min. I was told there were plenty of open seats and was sent to customer service to change the ticket. The agent again admitted they changed my flight without informing me but demanded I pay $125 to change the ticket. She stated they will only help customers who buy directly through their website. I called Frontier and all they could offer me was to mail a copy of my itinerary to my home (not helpful). I have never encountered such a rude unhelpful company and will never fly Frontier again. Avoid!"
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I am a frequent flier on various airlines but trying Frontier was the worst mistake I've made. My trip was supposed to start from Portland OR and end in Houston TX. At the airport they had only one check in counter and only 2 representatives and when I arrived 50 minute before departure there was no representative at the check in counter. I tried the kiosk machine to check in but it said I needed to check in at the counter. I contacted the company and was put on hold for almost 2 hr. on and off. When I decided to rebook they told me to pay $100 despite a long wait and their fault. I only had a small carry on and my suit but they told me to check in my small carry on and pay $25. Frontier is a rip off unprofessional customer service and a disgrace to the airline industry. Based on my experience I would never use Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,F9 846 SEA to DEN Oct 24. F9 182 DEN to OKC. Return F9 185 OKC to DEN F9 841 DEN to SEA. This trip with Frontier Airlines was one of the worst airline experiences. Many of the flight attendants knocked you every time they walked down the aisles. Never an apology. You had to ask for a cup of water. You had to pay for soft drinks. If we can help it we will never fly Frontier again. The only good thing was they were on time but other than that terrible service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,They charge for everything you can get one tiny glass of water and then you have to pay. Inflight entertainment was non existent unless you pay. Also I was unaware of the fact that if you don't check in at least 45 min before your flight that they will bump you. I checked in 44 min before my flight and they refused to let me board. I had to buy a $400 one way ticket from Southwest just to make it to my second leg and then they told me I would have to pay a change fee and fare difference on a flight I already bought. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2,no,,Washington - Denver - Albuquerque. Flights: 721 335 340 724. 10/15/13 - 10/21/2013. Seats assigned at last minute. I was told I could pay more to get a better seat assignment. All passengers had to line up twice once to verify size of carry on and another to board.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Not a stellar flight from PDX to IAH but the return was truly horrid. We hit traffic got lost and arrived with just 20 minutes to departure but boarding passes and baggage fees receipts in hand because we knew we had to check baggage due to there extreme size and weight policies. There was no one at the counter. It turns out they close the counter 45 minutes before departure. Really? 2.5 hours later around 20 people were waiting to check in. I had to pay $100 to rebook the next day and get a hotel.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Frontier airlines was the 2nd part of our journey to our vacation in Seattle to be honest our first flight was with AA and that was horrible. The crew on AA nothing memorable but Frontier staff were so pleasant. I made sure when booking our flights that the connecting flights were at least 2hrs apart the service on Frontier was great and I will definitely fly with them again but this time we'll upgrade to more leg room. My Husband and I were quite happy and will use this airline again whenever we can.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,,The customer service on Frontier is lacking. On a recent trip from Chicago to Denver changing planes then Denver to SLC I was frustrated by the lack of compassion by the Frontier staff. My daughter has MS and uses forearm crutches. Because we booked on a third party site the attendant assigned us a seat on the back row of the plane. It was very difficult for my daughter to navigate her way to the back of the plane. From Denver to SLC I asked the gate attendant if my daughter could please get a seat with more leg room closer to the front of the plane. He said they had a seat with more leg room on row 2 however it would cost an additional $15 for each of the three seats we needed. I did not think someone who is disabled should have to pay to be accommodated. While we were waiting to board the plane he announced several times that there was seating with additional leg room available for $5 or $15 depending on your type of ticket. In the end the seats with additional legroom were empty and my daughter had to go to the back row of the plane. Another frustration was we had to pay $85 to check our baggage because our third party ticket did not allow for carry-on luggage. Then there was the tackiness of having to pay for a soft drink and snacks again because we purchased our ticket through a third party. If you're going to treat customers poorly because they booked their ticket through a third party then don't offer tickets through third parties like Jet Blue does. All of their nickel and dime policies make me want to spend my dollars traveling with another airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My niece and her new husband were flying last Sunday 10/6 from SLC to Denver and on to Cancun. They arrived at the ticket counter at 6.45 am for a 7.25 flight to Denver. Frontier has a policy that you have to check in at the ticket counter 45 minutes before your flight. No where on the printed ticket did it say that. When they arrived the person at the ticket counter told them they were 5 minutes late so they would not let them check a bag or go through security. There were 6 other people in the same boat. When someone finally came back to the ticket counter 45 minutes later they charged an extra $200 and were told to come back tomorrow. Frontier went out of their way to make sure people didn't get on their flight. We will never fly Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,KC to Denver- my flight was due to leave at 8.30 am. At 9.00 it was announced that the flight was delayed and more announcements would follow. Announcement at 9.30 am the flight will be at 10.30. At 10.30 it was announced that at 1.00 it would be announced if the flight would be cancelled or rescheduled for later that day. Also was told to be thinking about booking a different flight just in case. I went to the ticket counter and asked about a different flight. I was given a flight to Chicago on a different airline and would catch a flight from there to Denver. I went to the gate of the different airline and noticed that I landed in O'Hare but flew out of Midway. I asked the person at the gate about it. He checked it and said to return to the ticket counter. By that time the line was very long and only 1 person was handling that canceled flight. 4 hours later I got to the counter. I had to stay the night and flew to Dallas to catch a flight to Denver from there. I lost 2 days of work extra parking fees.Told they would send me a $75 voucher. They can not pay me to fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,0,no,,I booked a flight from Org City to Bismarck ND on Sept 13 2013. We were 1 hour 40 min late leaving. Told we would keep same plane to go into Bismarck because the other plane had already left since we were late. When we arrived at Denver we were told that this plane was needed elsewhere and to go to the service desk. Waited in line for 2 hours got to a rep and was told that they did not have another flight to Bismarck until Monday. Told they would fly us to Fargo or Willison the next day and we could rent a car and go to Bismarck. They said we could see if United could get us in the next day for $500 one way but United did not honor them. I booked United I had a boot on my leg since I had fractured my foot and could not drive easily. When I called Frontier Customer services upon returning from my flight I was told that it was the weather. This is the worst airline I have flown.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,August 8 2013 Salt Lake City to Denver Denver to Wilmington return. Frontier Airlines are unfriendly and crowded. They treated us like cattle as we were preparing to board. Do we have to expect rudeness and poor service to get a decent deal? How much can it cost to give us a small glass of orange juice? I wondered if this is just the way airline travel has become but my husband flew on Delta last week and was treated much better and enjoyed his juice. My sister flew on Southwest and even had a bag checked for free. I hope I never have to fly on Frontier again. If you had a spot for zero stars below rating travel experience I would rate zero stars. Frontier is definitely the worst in my experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,1,no,,"I will never fly Frontier Airlines again. I booked a ticket from St Louis to Phoenix. I started off in St. Louis and connected through Denver to arrive in Phoenix. While in St. Louis I checked one bag for $25. I then paid an additional $45 to have ""More Legroom Seating."" and Zone 1 boarding. St. Louis leg was fine. Denver is where the issues take place. As I boarded in Zone 1 I was asked to step aside and stand in a line as the flight attendant needed to speak to me. I was informed that I needed to pay an additional $100 to carry my purse and computer bag onto this plane before I could get on my flight home. I explained to the flight attendants that I would have easily packed my computer into my existing bag that I checked in St. Louis. The flight attendant asked me to dump my purse into my computer bag. It was never mentioned to me in St. Louis that I may have to absorb an additional cost to carry my purse and computer bag onto plane. Beware of the lower priced fares of Frontier. They will charge you in the beginning middle and end! You could fly first class on other airlines."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,"We flew from Costa Rica to ATL stayed for 7 days then back to SFO. We were told we get one free baggage per person. I confirmed again a day before. At the check-in we had to pay for baggage simply because we had stayed 7 days in ATL so it is not considered international flight. Gate check-in was a joke. She grabbed our printed boarding pass and left us nothing to show our seat number. When we asked her she said 'You did not print 2 copies?"". Really? I need to print 2 copies of boarding pass per person? Next the safety announcement at flight 429 on 10/9/2013 sounds like someone is forcing a 15 year old to read an English essay. I highly recommend travellers avoid this airline if you can."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I was given this trip the purpose was to see a concert in Seattle and we were scheduled to arrive at 2 pm. Due to a weather delay our initial flight out of KC was delayed-this is not Frontier's fault. I asked the ticket counter clerk if I needed to be put on a later flight and that I was even willing to purchase a flight on another airline because I had to be in Seattle before 8 pm. The counter clerk told me this delay would cause a 'ripple' effect and that my flight out of Denver would be delayed. The flight out of Denver wasn't delayed and we missed it - and missed out on all of the flights that we could have booked when we were in KC. The only available flight was on a partner airline and arrived to Seattle at 11.15 because it had to go through Phoenix first. On the way back our flight was delayed again - this time it was not weather and we were automatically put on a later flight out of Denver to KC. This meant that we had to start our drive home 3 hours later than originally planned. Somehow we made it to Denver before our original flight left. They wouldn't let us on the plane. The ticket counter told me I had to change my ticket at customer service. Customer service called the ticket counter who told them we could not board the plane - that plane was actually delayed until 7.45. We sat and watched the plane we had purchased tickets for take off. I am giving them low ratings on everything because the seat comfort really doesn't matter when they can't do the basic job of getting you to one place when they say they will.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,,Left on Friday 10/4 at 6.15 am. First time flyer on Frontier. The ticket desk was horrible. They were so rude to each customer that went up to the ticket desk. It became the joke of the customers in line and than on flight. They acted as if we should be lucky they were there instead of treating us as the customers. Flight attendants were abrupt and never helpful or kind. Awful experience. When I got to my destination I talked with my son and his fiancee who flew the day before. Same thing happened to them. On the way home from Oklahoma City on 10/7 we had an amazing experience. My ratings below are on MPLS only.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,"I booked the flight via a 3rd party agent depart from Los Angeles to Indianapolis with one carry-on with me for the weekend. Arrived at LAX 20 minutes before departure. Incredibly I avoided the extremely long line and made it through the kiosk quickly but did not realize that they charge $25 carry-on fee for 3rd party booking users. So I got charged $100 at the terminal gate in order to board the flight instead of $25. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to bad weather in their hub in Denver. On the returning flight I arrived at the Frontier counter in Indianapolis 50 minutes before departure. Few people in front of me and a few behind me at the counter with only 2 employees working there with extra slow pace. By the time I reach the counter I been told that their counter has been shut down 45 minutes prior to the departure as well as the Kiosk so there is no way for me to pass TSA without a boarding pass. Their employees were extremely rude with a bad attitude. Both left the counter and shut down everything. All they said was ""read the sign and call the 1-800 numbers for help. I called the number but ended up wasting my time. It was $100 to reschedule which I did not accept. In the end I had to purchase a one- way flight from Delta across the lobby for $450.90 in order for me to get back to Los Angeles on Sunday. I have learned some lessons from this incident which I will definitely avoid Frontier Airline in my life."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,My family booked its trip on Frontier Airlines through Travelocity. From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip greatly. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket our carry-on bag would be $50 a bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverage except water. Also Frontier Airlines has implemented a new policy that if your boarding pass is not checked in 45 minutes prior to your flight you are not allowed on the plane and are to be rebooked. My family was traveling in a very small airport turned in our rental car and got in line about 50 minutes before the flight. Please note that there is no one in the security line and that it would take about 10 minutes to check in and go through security at this airport. As we are standing in line it is announced that my family along with 15 others will not be allowed on the plane and that we will need to rebook. Because it is a small airport the soonest that Frontier Airlines could get us to our destination was 2.5 days later. My family rented a car drove to another airport 7 hours away paid for new tickets on another airline and got home late that evening. Frontier Airlines is known as an airline for value however booking with them cost my family an additional $1200 and left many of their patrons sitting in the airport stranded. My family along with many extended members will never fly Frontier again and we will make sure to share this experience with as many people as possible. For a customer service industry this is unacceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My wife and I were scheduled to go to Los Angeles to visit our family today. Arrived at Frontier in Bismarck ND an hour before the flight (at 5.30am). Bismarck is a tiny airport and the last time I attempted to get there 2 hours prior to departure no one was there. When we arrived there was a large line at Frontier we waited for 20+ minutes and the lady at the check in stated that Denver (Frontier's hub) had shut down their computers and nobody else would be able to check in. The entire line missed their flight. This was due to the fact they opened the check in line later than they should have. They did not shut down the check in line 45 mins prior to the flight departing because they were trying to catch up from a combination of opening up so late and the incredibly slow service. Not only were there no other flights that day the flight for the next day was full and we were told Saturday was the first option. You would also think this would be at no additional charge you would be wrong to think that as well. They charge you transfer fees third party booking fees difference in the cost of the new ticket etc... So all in all we initially paid $635 for the tickets for the two of us then I paid $679 to put my wife on a Delta flight same day to get her to LA lastly I paid $399 for myself to fly from Dickinson to LA on Friday morning. Frontier gave me a credit for the flight I missed that ended up being worth $33. That doesn't even cover the gas for me to drive back from Bismarck after they caused me to miss my flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I arrived at the gate with 40 minutes until departure. They would not give me a boarding pass! Additionally the rude lady at the counter would not re-book me or put me on standby for another flight. I had to buy new same day tickets with Southwest Airlines. Worst of all because I didn't make my outgoing flight they cancelled my return flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,September 20th - first flight: ABQ to Denver and Flight 2 Denver to Seattle WA. Both flights were delayed. The boarding process was chaotic the boarding by zones served no purpose: we had to wait in line before boarding for at least half hour because passengers struggled to find a spot to store their carryon luggage and struggling to get to their seats causing heavy traffic in the aisle. Attendants seemed to be as confused as us not knowing what to do. I and other passengers had to check in their carryon as all the overhead compartments were full. The check- in agent did not seem to know what to do either. Finally arriving in Denver I headed to the customer service to make sure my carry-on would get to my final destination when I arrived at the counter the three employees who were not helping anyone literally ignored me for some time and then finally a rude employee did not really help me out but sent me to another gate in order to receive service. Second flight was delayed due to refuel process. Paying for entertainment may be justified but paying for non alcoholic beverages is not acceptable. I will definitely not fly with this airline ever again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,,"We booked through Cheapo Air because tickets were cheaper. Well we made up for this at the airport when we checked our bags - $25 for checked bag and $20 for carry on - each. We followed online instructions that said it would be cheaper if we checked in online - so we did. I used my smartphone so could not print a boarding pass. At the completion of this online check in I got the message ""online check-in confirmed"" - this was witnessed by four other people. At the airport we were told that they had no record of our online check-in so had to pay $50 for checked bag and $25 for our carry-on. Not only that but the 3 of us did not get seats together. We had to approach the ticket counter every stop (4 times) and beg to get our seats changed so we could sit together. On two ""legs"" of our trip we got the very back row which was stuffy/hot/uncomfortable. If you have booked your flights together they should know that you want to sit together. It's ridiculous! It all comes down to booking with them so you will pay a higher fee for your ticket. One ""leg"" of our trip the flight was delayed almost one hour with no explanation no notification no apology. We would never fly Frontier again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,,9/13/2013 Flights: 231 Nashville to Denver 551 Denver to San Diego 563 Denver to San Diego. Travelers beware. Frontier is no longer what it once was. The ticket gate and customer service agents will - either through incompetence or deliberate false manipulation - frustrate your efforts to smooth out the hiccups caused by their poor schedule management. Flight delays and missed connections are tough luck - takes 12 hours to travel Nashville to San Diego or Chicago to Las Vegas or Austin to Denver. There were 100s of these stories just in one day. The staff denied that connections would be missed (they were) claimed all flights were delayed (they weren't) claimed later flights were full (not true). New militant carry on baggage measurements and charges don't ask for water coffee or a soda unless you have your credit card handy and don't count on them having anything edible on board. If you still decide to travel with this miserable airline the best of luck.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I flew Frontier approx 2 years ago to Vegas and had a bad experience then. I ignorantly decided to give them another try and flew to San Diego from Nashville with a layover in Denver same route back to Nashville. Not only was the check in staff rude but they messed up our seat assignments. My husband and I who were on our honeymoon checked in 2 hours early and they still managed to mess up our seat arrangements made during the booking process 4 months prior. We ended up having to fly seated separately. Normally we wouldn't be too upset but it was our honeymoon and we did check in with adequate time and booked our flights well in advance. Needless to say I will never use this airline again.
,,,,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,3,no,1,I got an early flight from IND to PDX. Flight 613 was 2+ hours late so Frontier rebooked to later flight with 20 minute connection in DEN which was obviously missed. Rebooked again on Alaska Air to SFO then Virgin Air to PDX later that night. After traveling over 12 hours now my bags are in SEA waiting for next flight to PDX so I have to wait hours again! Bags never made flight! Drove to SEA airport to pick them up. Trip home 2 weeks later flight 792 from PDX on time only to find out in DEN that flight is actually delayed but not before running 40 gates to make a connection then running 40 gates back to new gate. All airport displays showing on time at wrong gate! Now sitting at new gate waiting hours again. Flight 1608 finally leaves well after 4.30 with a reserve pilot. Not once did we get to watch TV on any one segment of flight to or from PDX! I will look for other airlines in the future.
,,,,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,We recently flew to and from Denver to Anchorage. Both were night flights. Your cabin and reading lights are awful. Those greyish/white lights make the plane feel like a parking garage and impossible to read by. Yes everyone is transitioning to new types of lighting but there are better lighting options out there.
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Our flight ILG-MDW was wonderful. Wilmington airport was a breeze flight was pleasant arrived 30 minutes early. We upgraded to STRETCH seating which was very comfortable. Flight crew was extremely friendly and personable. I look forward to flying them in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Flew late July from Vegas to Cancun via Denver. Realised that bags had not been booked apparently you can not do this from UK. I attempted to book online day before leaving Vegas but was not permitted to do this. At airport we paid for bags and asked to have two seats together as my partner is a very nervous flyer. Check-in staff in Denver were lovely and quickly changed our seats. Staff on flights were probably the worst I have flown. Landing announcements were quite funny and instead of reminding passengers to check the overhead compartments for personal belongings we may have stored she said to check for any personal problems we may have left there. Didn't flying used to be fun and exciting and not a chore.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Orlando to Trenton on 8/28 and return 9/3/13. I had one of the best flights I've had! I was bothered about the reviews I read prior to my flight and I can testify that my Frontier flight was flawless. It on time crew and staff couldn't have been more professional and courteous. I look forward to flying into Trenton NJ again.

Return flight on August 27th on Flight 157 from Des Moines to Denver and on Flight 575 to Salt Lake City. I have flown Frontier several times within the past four or five years and have never experienced difficulty. However on this flight I was shocked by the apparent focus of the staff on measuring each person's carry on bags. I saw several customers being sent back to the security desk to pay a $50 fee so that they could carry on a backpack - simply because the backpack did not fit in the measuring tool. Each item individuals had to pay extra for were not overweight nor extremely large. Many of them had backpacks the same size as mine and my backpack fit completely under the seat with no problem. Personally I had to remove my dirty laundry out of the front compartment of my suitcase and transfer it to my checked on bag or I would have had to pay an extra $50 to check on my carry on bag. I believe Frontier has changed their focus from convenience and friendliness to customers and are now focused on making more money. I remember the days when Frontier used to serve complementary drinks and cookies on their flights. Now they charge $2 for a glass of apple juice. Forget the cookies. I will not be using this airline again in the near future.
,,,,,,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,DEN-SLC. Not for the business traveler. In a competitive industry - you would think that the airline would want last minute top dollar customers. Finished meeting early have 4.30 flight but not able to take the 1.55 - would not accept me as standby because I am not their rewards customer. Frontier does not fly anywhere that would warrant being a rewards member. Also the entire cabin was laughing because of the flight attendants trance to ensure that everyone was charged for their carry on luggage.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Arrived at 5am to Salt Lake City Airport to find my flight cancelled. Nobody had received any type of alert. After 1 hr 15 mins we were finally addressed by a Frontier Airlines employee who was passing out customer service cards and telling us that we would likely have better results by calling or rebooking. I called finding a 45 minute wait should be expected. Like many customers I was on a tight schedule and decided to book with Southwest Airlines. My Southwest flights were excellent. On the returning trip the first flight was 45 minutes late. We had a similar wait on my connecting flight though we were told repeatedly that there would be a delay of some sort with no explanation or expected time which ended up lasting at least an half hour. I understand that things like this happen but I was happy to land in my final destination.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,5,yes,5,I have traveled with this airline several times in the past year from Utah to Arkansas and have never encountered any problems. The last trip was SLC to LR. Once onboard the plane proceeded to the runway where there was a 45 minute delay. Had to return to the gate told we had a choice to deplane or stay but all connecting flights would be missed in DEN. We boarded again and went to DEN. Staff were amusing and more than willing to offer any information. We all received our hotel accommodation food vouchers and questions were answered quickly and efficiently. The next day was a piece of cake - I flew on to SLC but had problems with losing my bag but had it delivered to my home by 5am the next morning. One thing I didn't understand was the first flight they gave a free beverage but the one from DEN to SLC they wanted to charge for a soda. I feel like a beverage is a very small request for the price of an airline ticket.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,I have to say my round trip went without a hitch. Both my departure and return flight were on time with no mechanical problems. The staff were cordial and my seat was the same as any other airline as far as comfort. Yes they do charge for drinks and snacks so if that bothers you buy your own in the airport (it is the same price anyway). I flew from Delaware to Houston and it cost 110 dollars. All other airlines that had direct flights were asking between 350-400 dollars. For that price difference I am willing to shell out 5 dollars for a snack and something to drink. Maybe I had beginners luck but I did save quite a bit of money.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Began flying Frontier out of Williston ND some 3 years ago since they were the only carrier there. I live in Utah so would have expected basic but acceptable service. It seems the longer I continue flying with them the more the problems. Coming home to Utah this last time meant delay after delay (I had some 5 delay announcements sent to my email all after I already knew about it!) causing me to miss my connection at Denver. Almost had to stay overnight. Had been gone from home 3 months! How difficult is it to maintain their equipment? Always an issue for them. Now United and Delta are flying to North Dakota. I have to return with Frontier but won't fly them again. I'd rather fly someone else for $100 more who has their act together without the drama and adventure. Hope they go out of business soon.
,,,,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,I purchased the tickets in February to fly Classic Plus in April and return in May. When I scheduled this round trip ticket the airline stated I would receive free television on both flights along with discounted liquor. On the first flight I did and the service was great. On the flight back I was informed Frontier no longer provided such service and canceled in between the time of my three week business trip. Had it not have been for the TV baggage fees reduced and beverages I would have chosen I different airline. They either need to inform prior to flying as the company knew I had the ticket so I could get a different company or honor their' commitment when I paid for the ticket.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,SEA-DEN-ILG (Wilmington DE) one way. A pleasant enough way to travel. Had exit row seats on both legs at $20 per segment on an economy fare this is a steal and well worth it. Yes you do have to pay for drinks but they will give you a cup of water for free if you ask. Why not just charge an extra $2/ticket and give everyone a free drink and a small snack? Flight from DEN delayed 35 minutes due to waiting on a crew member to deadhead. Carry on bag policy enforced at DEN with all bags sized but not SEA - if an airline wants to be strict they should do it at every airport. Some people were bringing bags on the Seattle flight that were clearly over-sized. Wilmington New Castle airport is a great alternative to chaotic PHL but has little to no room for expansion and is crowded with just one flight on the ground.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,"LAX-DEN. Bought a ticket after 20 hour flight from Asia since it was a better connection to DEN. Flight delayed 1.5 hours and had to rebook everyone making a connection - 2 agents for 70 people who were totally incompetent could not get anything done. No announcements no information just rude attitude from ground staff. My bags were checked through onto Frontier and I checked with agent to make sure they would get loaded on from the international flight after clearing customs in LAX - she assured me ""no problem"" and of course on arrival - no bag. Had to wait 36 hours before they were delivered. Never again."
,,,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,0,yes,7,"My son and I flew from ANC to SFO (and return) via DEN. Satisfied by all flights and crew. However I did notice some changes since my last flight(s) one being the new charges for carryons. The folks at SFO began to implement this new policy and it caused quite a bit of confusion for the passengers and some noted unhappiness at having to pay. Some folks were not pleased with having to have their stuff ""sized up"" prior to boarding. The new policy of charging for all drinks was not too popular as well. I spoke with a couple of crew members from the various flights we were on and a basic theme appeared ""we seem to be heading towards becoming Spirit"". Crew members were not too thrilled. I was using my miles on this trip and my last one with my daughter recently. I have been both an Ascent and Summit member for years and have been very pleased with Frontier. I am however somewhat scared about their becoming a bottom feeder. I know change is always around the corner with airlines but the nickel and dimes they are going after is not right in my way of thinking. Keep it up and I will be traveling on Alaska Air year round."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,My daughter took a teaching job in Phoenix we drove from Michigan to help her get settled. Tried to use Frontier to get back to Michigan - worst experience ever! My husband was to fly out on Sunday the 28th at 3.14 to Denver after several hours was sent to O'Hare had to stay overnight get up at 5.00 to get flight to Grand Rapids Michigan. I stayed until Saturday 3rd 3.14 flight after a delay got on the plane sat for half an hour got off the plane. 2 hour delay - stood in line to change connecting flight Denver to Grand Rapids. Line up to board plane - cancelled. Back to the line for new connecting flight. 9.00pm all flights to Denver cancelled. Back in line. Phoenix to Miami at 10.40. Miami to O'Hare at 6.40 am. Now I need to be picked up in Chicago. Terrible experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,First and last Frontier trip SFO to/from Denver. 1.5 hour delay out of SFO. Nearly 3 hour delay out of Denver - 2am arrival! Had to get a taxi home at 3am. Should have flown more expensive flight on another airline. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Had a 2.5hr delay on the first flight (no apologies or service recovery offered) and another 2hr delay on the return flight because they used the same mechanically inept plane. The return flight was to be the first of the day. An entire plane of peoples plans ruined.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Flew from DTW to Denver (connecting flight to SNA) traveling with two small children (3 years old and 9) they offered us a ""complementary soda"" nothing else! On the way back to DTW a week later we checked in 2 hours early and they sat us all including my 3 year old child all by him self the representative at the ticket counter simply said there is nothing she could do! No more complementary sodas."
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Daughter and I flew down to SLC from ANC changing planes in DEN. No problems going or returning with the small exception of a somewhat rude/uncaring employee at check-in at SLC. The service was fine the planes clean and the flight crews were caring and professional. The crew on the return to ANC was the best I have ever had on any airline professional and funny. I have them on the flight tonight returning to DEN as my son and I fly to SFO. I expect the flight will be a good one!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,,DEN-SJO. Cramped in a seat with no recline. I tried to call in advance to book a seat seat assignment via website did not work. Online check-in not working. It seems that service is non-existent anymore on that airline. Attendants came shortly after take off to sell snack boxes and beverages for $2. No free water service on a 5 hour flight. Attendants very rude sat around and chatted the whole flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Seattle to Omaha 7/12/13 Flights: 510 and 432. Omaha to Seattle 7/15/13 Flights: 437 and 843. I have had many complications with this airline. The last 4 flights I was on over this past weekend did not leave on time. The shortest waiting time was 2 hours after original departure and the longest was 24 hours. I have many other opinions on why I am not satisfied with this airline and will not fly with them.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,I flew Denver to DC. Outbound was pleasant enough by today's flying standards. The way back was horrible. I had the same weight suitcase as when I left and they wanted to charge 75 dollars for an overweight bag but a second bag is 20 dollars. The person at the counter was very rude. They started charging for beverages on July 1st. If you add up the fees this airline charges you will actually pay less with another more expensive carrier. I'd shop around before booking tickets with Frontier.
,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Booked MSN to DEN. Had a 13.5 hour delay one day - was able to reschedule for the next day at 6am. The delay for that flight next was 3.5 hours. Poor communication and limited options made the situation worse. Both delays were mechanical in nature.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,1,Flying from Cancun Mexico to Denver. Spent 45 minutes at gate waiting for maintenance to repair a tray that wouldn't stay latched. Then another 20 minutes for a refuel. Only two updates on status in the entire hour. Missed the connecting flight. After another 4 hours we here the announcement that the Denver to SLC flight was delayed 30 minutes. Given a card with a phone number to file a complaint or a compliment. The wait times were horrendous and after waiting for 15 to 30 minutes with no answer - we tried this several times. Most recently it said high call volume. Not surprised. Hope we never have to fly Frontier airline again. Staff fairly unconcerned.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,Not a pleasant return flight from Denver. Flew DEN-STL on the 'economy' fare. Seats were okay but became uncomfortable and pitch was poor. Beverage service was nonexistent since drinks now cost $1.99. That is ridiculous. Flight attendants were rude. The bright side was the TV service.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,"There is room for improvement. Left from STL at 5.00 on time outbound to DEN. Seats weren't that great. They were thin and uncomfortable. Very little lumbar support. Flight attendants were okay a little aloof but kind. Inflight entertainment was nice but you had to pay for it. No complimentary snacks. Drinks were free but will be $1.99 as of 7/1/13 - ridiculous. Plane was somewhat dirty. Very wide plane however (A320). Seat pitch wasn't bad (I'm 5'9""). Landed ahead of schedule. Overall pleasant first experience but could have been better."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,0,no,,Flight number 122 from Denver to Dallas on 6/30/13. Flight delayed 3 hours and I never received any notification from the airlines via email text automated call. The customer service desk was very unhelpful in exploring other flight options since the flight now doesn't leave until 11pm. They also were very unhelpful in providing any information. I will never use Frontier again this is a first and a last.
,,,,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I once again had a great experience flying Frontier-ANC to SLC via DEN. The planes were clean the service was excellent and always on time. We actually landed in ANC 30 minutes early on the return. I have yet to have a less than positive flight ever with them. I have been flying them since they arrived in ANC many years ago. Good choice overall.
,,,,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight 929 from Trenton to Detroit yesterday. After hearing a number of bad comments I had very low expectations. They gave me an option of a food box which I liked. Had a small TV in front of my seat. Flight attendants were funny and very nice. Seats were comfortable.
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,The worst airline I've flown. My flight got changed 7 times. Each time it was a new reason why the flight time was changed. My flight was suppose to take off at 8am. Did not leave until 9pm. The service alone was enough to make me never want to fly with the airline again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,"I flew from Columbus Ohio to Trenton New Jersey a few weeks ago and had a good experience. I was worried because of the unfavourable reviews but I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Frontier is your typical ""no-frills"" airline. You do have to pay for a snack but for the price I paid for the flight I wasn't complaining about that. The position of the seats was a tad uncomfortable however my flight was short so it wasn't too much of a problem for me. The staff and flight attendants were helpful and friendly and there were no delays on either flight. In fact the return flight arrived early. In my opinion Frontier is a good value and I would fly with them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,DCA to Jackson Hole Wyoming. Flights to Denver and one to Jackson Hole were on time. New clean Airbus 319s. Friendly and helpful crew. Return flight from Jackson Hole left about 40 minutes late due to weather but they held connecting flight in Denver and arrival in DCA only 10 minutes late. Excellent experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,,I foolishly accepted a great rate flight forgetting you get what you pay for. Flight delayed from LAX to Denver 3.5 hours upon arriving in Denver the staff were completely useless and preferred bad attitudes over customer service. The amount of misinformation received was nothing short of incredible. Management was useless. I will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,0,no,,Friday 24 May 2013. Frontiers Denver flight was delayed 3 hours which caused me to miss my connection to Reagan Airport so an agent booked me on a United flight from Denver to Dulles. While at the gate I was told I needed to check my luggage because it may not fit in the overhead bin although my carryon luggage met the requirements of a carry on. Once I arrived in Denver I was told by a United agent that they no longer have a contract with Frontier and I was unable to board the plane. So while I did not board the United flight my luggage was on its way to Dulles. I then had to stay over night in Denver and pay for my own hotel. When I finally made it back to Oklahoma I was told my bag was located and it would be sent to my house. Received a call Tuesday 28 May 2013 stating my luggage was still at Dulles with United.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,Have no problems with Frontier except their seats. Horrible and I've flown over 60 flights with other airlines. Never had a seat that uncomfortable. The cushioning in the seats is terrible.
,,,,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,5,"No huge gripe here but it just seems Frontier has joined just about every other airline in the USA in their quest for uncomfortable mediocrity. My tray tables on each of 4 flights were filthy and the seats are very hard. ""Classic Plus"" gives you a few more inches of leg room but little else. They will attempt to charge you for your complimentary beverage upgrade and nobody on that aircraft will get any freebies not even a tiny bag of pretzels. Don't expect a magazine (or even SkyMall) or any free TV/movie viewing. The in-flight credit card sales pitch is the icing on this cake of cheapskate tackiness."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,,Flew Frontier last week and had a horrible experience. On the way back they were delayed 1 hour due to weather even though looking at a radar of the entire US there were no weather issues anywhere. Another staff member said it was an air traffic control delay where another said it was a TSA issue. They wouldn't hold our connecting flight for 5 minutes and we missed our flight. We had to wait 5 hours. Finally they lost our luggage and I still don't have it back. I have yet to receive a phone call. It has now been 4 days since the flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,The planes were clean and the staff very nice. What I didn't like was they push for you to sign up for a Frontier Airlines Mastercard. They should be pushing you to get one of their cards in the Concourse / Gate Area that seems more comfortable to me than having the Flight Attendants doing it. The live TV service has gone up in price didn't like that - they should have left the price alone.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,,New Orleans to Denver: heavy rain flight delayed. Staff tell us we won't make our connection so should go back pay for our own hotel and try again tomorrow. We insist that we go to Denver now they reluctantly concede but take us off the connection flight giving us tickets for next day. We should have insisted that we get the boarding passes for the connection and then change those if we can't make it. Before departing we call our travel agency who tell us that there is a United flight with seats departing the same day and Frontier was responsible for placing us on that. Onboard: staff start asking me where I'm going then essentially grab my carry-on bag out of my hand to check it in. I explain that due to my short connection my bag will almost certainly not make it and ask to check for a space. They say no. I was shocked by their abruptness and rudeness. In Denver: our connection is delayed and is boarding as we leave the plane. They won't let us on. After a phone call staff at the gate decide to let us on. In Seattle: naturally they didn't get my bag there on time. I had to get it myself the next day.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I've got no problem with the on-the-ground staff of Frontier. Most are hardworking nice folks but I may never fly Frontier ever again due to their poor management making decisions. Thr overhead compartments wouldn't be extremely full if they didn't start charging to put bags under the plane years ago. Now they will charge us to have a carry-on bag for our own good of course. Also promo codes that their site say they are good for a certain time they don't last until the time they say they are usable. That's just dishonest. All things considered it's enough to push me away from ever wanting to fly them again. I'm happy to take my business elsewhere especially when other companies fares are identical. Why fly a dishonest airline that talks down to their customers?
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I will never fly frontier again Trenton Airport customer service is horrible and they don't have someone to take your baggage down to security for you when you have an infant a child to tend to and I also had my 90 year old grandmother with me who was in a wheelchair. When it was time to board the airplane they didn't have the walk way connected to the plane. They had to push my grandmother up on the ramp. We got to the door of the airplane they had my grandmother sitting in the middle seat they had to change her seat 3 or 4 times. We just wanted to go to Orlando FL with my children but I will go to the Philadelphia Airport and get on United to make our next trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,TTN-TPA round-trip. Booked 1 week in advance and paid under $200 round-trip whereas US Airways and Southwest's fares were twice as much. Overall good value for money. In addition to the savings on airfare I was able to park for free at the Trenton airport. Since the flights were full we were given the opportunity to gate check our carry-ons and pick them up at baggage claim. This came in handy flying from TTN to TPA since I wouldn't have to carry my garment bag through the Tampa airport. But I would advise don't gate check carry-ons when flying into a small airport like Trenton. I had to wait in a cramped baggage claim for probably 30 minutes for my bag no thanks to the ground crew taking their sweet time. As much as I don't like the Philadelphia airport at least bags are going around the carousel by the time I get to baggage claim. Also although Frontier has DirecTV on the seat backs if you get the lowest fare you have to pay extra for it. And if you're thinking about purchasing snacks you better have a credit or debit card because they don't accept cash.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,"We had purchased 2 return tickets MDT (Harrisburg) to MCO (Orlando). Did online check-in 24 hr prior to takeoff at which time we purchased and paid for Frontier's Stretch seating. Selected a middle for myself and window for son who is over 6 ft tall. They called our name and boarded us first before all other passengers. My extra charge stretch seat became awful when Frontier determined the seat (aisle) next to me was the only place that would accommodate a ""double wide"" passenger. Their term not mine. They wheeled the passenger in and we spent 2 hours skin to skin with me unable to move. There would have been absolutely no way to access the screen controls. We also were unable to get out for bathroom use or for any other reason. I understand we all have different body types and sizes but it's unfair for me to pay extra for more room yet getting the worst possible seat on the plane. I will never pay for ""stretch"" seating on Frontier I won't be flying with them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,,,2,no,2,This is the worst airline ever. Only use them if you are desperate and if you are plan to have a terrible experience. I have taken hundreds of flights good and bad and Frontier is one I will never take again. I've only used them three times but each time they have been delayed. I mean 20 minute delay fine but each flight has been delayed over an hour and usually close to two. One was weather related and okay of course that happens but other times there has been no excuse. And when I have talked to them on the phone they give no information for why its delayed! I've only taken this airline because it flies into an airport right by my parents so its easier when I go to visit them but Id much rather fly to Newark or JFK and take a train to my family! Lesson finally learned. But really Frontier get your stuff together.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,2,Our flight was changed to us air. Me and my wife 2 children 1 being an infant had seating together and select seating. We were moved to another flight seated apart when there was an entire row above us for same price open. We were denied be able to have those seats and sit together. I had asked for a reason and none was given. I asked to speak to the air manager. What kind of business downgrades their customers to a worse seating arrangement when its the companies problem they had to move our flight? We also had to pay the baggage fee difference. Customer service was horrible I will have to say I would never book a flight with Frontier Airlines again and would gladly pay more to another airline that would accommodate their customers.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,This airline could not provide a flight-crew for a flight from Kansas City to Boston so the flight was cancelled. We were then transferred to a flight to LaGuardia. We got to LaGuardia and had to switch terminals to the flight which was a US Airways flight with the rest of the people from our original flight. We got to the terminal and the flight had left and all other services to Boston had finished. We were told to go the baggage claim and take a bus to a hotel. Our bags had made it on the US Airways flight. We could not find the bus due to terrible communication skills between the passengers and the staff. However one very nice flight attendant on the flight to New York stepped outside the job description and helped passengers personally.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,We were pleased with our flight from Chicago to Denver and Denver to Las Vegas. I wish they had told us ahead of time that the seats in front of the emergency door don't recline. Our son has to have a reclining seat and we were not told about this prior to purchasing our tickets.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,2,LaGuardia-Denver-Phoenix. Incoming plane to LGA was delayed for mechanical reasons. Plane to DEN therefore left the gate 2 hours late. Sat on the Tarmac another hour and a half because of a fast moving storm. We all missed our flights out of DEN. Frontier denied responsibility for the delay secondary to the weather. Clearly if the incoming plane to LGA had been on time we would have left ahead of the storm and made it to our destination. I waited in line in Denver for an hour and a half to speak with the customer service agent who gave me incorrect information. I was finally booked on a flight leaving early the next morning to San Diego way out of my way with a transfer to PHX. Spent a sleepless night in Denver airport and got home 24 hours after the start of my journey.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,Trenton to Orlando. I flew with my husband and my 2 young boys. Check in took a little while because there was only 2 girls at the counter. Security check did not take long but was thorough. The plane was on the smaller side but not any smaller than Spirit Airlines planes. The seats are a little smaller than your Continental airline seats. If you are a larger person and don't like tight spaces don't fly Frontier or Spirit airlines. Flight out was on time some turbulence mostly smooth. Flight back was about an hour behind but made up some time in the air. The attendants were nice. Cleanliness as average. I found some trash in the pocket seat in front of me. We had no problems with Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Denver to Spokane (March '13). We were put in the back seats that don't recline at all. The space to the seat in front of us was so close to us that ii even blocked our reading light. The stewardesses were sympathetic but apparently couldn't offer us the empty 'stretch' seats unless we paid an extra 25 dollars. The stewardess said the 'stretch seats' had actually created the lack of leg room between other seats. Frontier should not have back seats that are so cramped and certainly shouldn't be charging full price for them. While giving the usual free beverages we found it very cheap and tacky that Frontier doesn't even give a bag of pretzels. To have to pay for even music channels is very poor for customer relations.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,,Booked a flight from MSP to DEN saved maybe 20 bucks on the flight. Started to taxi down the runway there was a problem where they told us they need to run tests that will take 45 minutes. 2 hours later they removed us from the plane. 3 more hours of unknown and no communication. Finally they routed a plane from another location and I touched down at 1.15 (2.15 local). Then it came time to come home my 3pm flight turned into the same thing this time we never boarded though. I waited in the DEN airport for mechanical issues until we were boarded at 8.15. I spent over 10 hours in one weekend waiting for Frontier Airlines. I have $300 in useless vouchers from one weekend - you could not pay me to fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,,I have flown Frontier twice in the last month. Both times the flight was delayed until it was later cancelled. The agents were very difficult to work with and did not provide reasonable accommodations. On the first flight I had to purchase a Delta flight or wait 2 to 3 days to get to my destination with no weather issues at the origin or destination airport. Today a Thursday I was turned away in Minneapolis and told they could not get me to a wedding in San Diego by Saturday. Given no alternatives in either case. Neither was acceptable and I will not fly this carrier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,My outbound flights were both on time and I really have no complaints other than both planes smelt. My return was delayed and after asking to be rebooked the gate agent said everyone was going to make connecting flight. She was incredibly rude and did not want to help anyone. After missing my flight which I knew was going to happen it took over an hour to rebook me and half my flight missed connections. Frontier could not get me into OMA within the next 24 hours so I drove. I would never recommend flying Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3,no,5,Have flown Frontier 3 times now each time seems to be a little worse. Just got back from a Florida trip via Harrisburg PA. Going down there was a problem with a seat late leaving. Coming back same problem sat onboard for one hour waiting for a seat to be fixed. My tickets were bought 3 months in advance and they were high in price one month before the flight they were 1/2 the price. So buying early isn't always the best way to go. Wanted to buy a snack they were out so made another choice they were out - this was the first flight of the day. Cheaper isn't always better.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,I checked in online the night before but did not have my boarding pass. I also was not checking any bags. I made it to the ticketing/baggage check counter right at 45 minutes before the flight time. I was told that I could not check in. Rather than wait in line I remembered seeing signs that you could get through security using your smart phone. I verified this with the agent before I went through security. Unfortunately I only had the pdf document downloaded to my phone and that was not sufficient. I needed to have the little speciality square that these smart phones can read. I had to return to ticketing to change my flight because I was definitely going to miss the flight. Then I had to fly standby and hope I could get on a later flight. So my lack of knowledge regarding the scanning/smart phone procedures did me in but it all started when the first agent gave me bad information. The agent that finally provided me with a boarding pass verified that the 1st agent should have been able to issue the boarding pass - it was only checking in at that point that required her. In hindsight I should have argued with the 1st agent or requested that he check with someone more experienced (or who was listening to me).
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,We traveled recently on a trip that was American Airlines to our destination but Frontier on our return. I have no complaints about the flight itself. We were delayed due to necessary de-icing but the captain and flight attendants kept us informed and we were grateful to arrive at our final destination only a couple hours late. My only complaint would be that they don't know how to seat people we were in a group of 4 (2 couples) and they seated us all over the plane in middle seats between people who were traveling alone. We weren't allowed to pick our seats or change them so that even couples could sit together. I just feel that if you book your trip early enough as we did there should be no excuse for such a terrible job of seating us.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,Booked our trip in Sep and paid for preferred seating. When we checked in at the ticket counter we were told that our seats that we prepaid for we're reserved for other customers and we were given seats further back. On the flight the seats we had paid for sat empty. While onboard I turned on my light to get a drink and the attendant said I would have to wait while she and another attendant stood in the front and had their drinks and snacks an hour later she came by and wanted to know if we wanted anything. Would not waste my money on such poor service.
,,,,,,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,,Return round-trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Trenton-Mercer NJ airport was a disaster. We had a return flight for Monday 2/10/13 at 6.40pm - they delayed the flight to 8.50pm then to 11.30pm then at 12.30am cancelled flight. They advised that they could book us on a flight back Friday - 5 days later! The flight Wednesday was fully booked. We asked that that they put us on another airline on Tuesday but they would only refund our fare. It ended up costing us double since we had to get one way tickets at the last minute on another airline. We had to fly into Newark airport and then arrange transportation back to our car in Trenton. We will never fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,All flights departed on time and either landed early or on time. The second flight DEN to IND was the best of all - one flight attendant knew my son loved the Frontier animals so he looked for some cards with the animals listed. He gave the whole family free headphones to watch TV for the rest of the flight. If the need arises to travel to DEN again I will definitely choose Frontier Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,5,Kansas City-Denver-Colorado Springs return 1-30-13 return 2-4-13. No problems on first leg but flight from Den to COS was late nearly 2 hours as originating flight from Minot ND was delayed due to mechanical. Return flight COS flight pushed back and stayed on tarmac for 30 minutes as one engine could not be started. Eventually corrected and just barely made connecting flight to MCI. Again no problems on the Denver to Kansas City flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,My daughter and I flew from Newport News to Denver and on to LAX on Jan 25 2013. Although both flights were enjoyable the first leg was particularly well managed by the flight crew. One of the passengers a lady with a small child 15 months old was doing an admirable job of keeping the little girl happy. On a 4.5 hour flight this is a nearly impossible task. After serving drinks an FA spent a good deal of time occupying the little ones time. As a parent myself and remembering what traveling with little ones could be like I am sure the mother of this child was very appreciative.
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,no,5,"We paid for classic plus going from KC to Denver and stretch on the return. You get 36"" of legroom but the seats were flat and uncomfortable at least for my back! On both flights we took off around 40 mins late with no apology or explanation. The flight attendants looked tired and were unfriendly. The check in staff were just as bad. Frontier needs to improve its customer service. A shame as they are good value."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,0,no,,Unacceptable service for our charter 12/23/12 to Punta Cana from Chicago and again back on 12/30-31/12. In brief 3 flights from O'Hare on 12/23 all delayed several hrs flight to Montego Bay was cancelled all because none of the crews were complete. They knew this was going to happen and never notified any of us. Offered no info or help. Coming back we waited 2 hrs at Punta Cana airport then flight cancelled.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,10,December 2012 round trip between Madison WI and Washington DC. The planes were up-to-date and the seats very comfortable. The service was superb at check-in gate and through the flight. Crew were organized and friendly. A nice touch was the raising of the cabin lights during beverage service. Many food items were available for sale. We didn't buy any but liked that there were options. Flights were comfortable and calm.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,We flew on Christmas Day from Madison to DCA (Reagan). It left 2 hours late. Return flight on 12/30/2012 left 4 hours late. Seemed to be a problem in gathering crew for the flight. Unprofessional appearance and very casual attitude. Here in Wisconsin we like having the option for a non-stop from Madison to Washington DC but the service is terrible. Hope I can find another way.
,,,,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Flew round trip from Ft Myers to Denver 12/12. Flight out was no problem. Return flight - flight listed as on time on the screens but we boarded over 30 minutes late. No announcement made that explained when we would be boarding the reason for the delay or any kind of apology or assurance. Asked to check our carryon bags at the gate which was not a problem except that my companion was not given the receipt from her bag check. The agent said she would be right back with the tag never returned and when my friend asked the attendant she was sent to the front of the plane and told by the gate agent that there was no way they could find the receipt. During the flight we experienced strong turbulence no acknowledgement was made by the flight attendants or by the pilot over the intercom system. We don't plan to fly Frontier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,1,no,,We left Seattle late but the gate and flight crew told us that the connection in Denver for my flight to Orlando would wait for us. Flight was pleasant and the air crew good. However the plane did not wait and no flights available until tomorrow. To add insult to injury they lost my bag.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,,Delayed over 2 hours. None of it related to weather issues. It was because we were short a stewardess for our flight and we had to wait for them to arrive from another city. My first and last time my children and I fly Frontier Airlines. Completely unacceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,no,2,Virginia to California in economy. They checked in all of the classic plus customers before checking in a single Economy customer. I and many others nearly missed our flights because of this. Once I actually got to my plane to make the 5 hour trip I realized once again because I was an economy passenger I then had to pay for movies! There's was no entertainment either direction which made for an even worse experience. On my way back to Virginia I had a lay over in Denver and realized my original flight Id bought from Colorado to Virginia was no longer in service and I had a 6 hour layover. I was never notified of the cancellation and this just confirmed that I will never fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,,,1,no,,Had an emergency flight back to Ohio. I left Albuquerque in bad weather but was reassured by Albuquerque Frontier staff that I would be able to catch the next flight back to Ohio. Frontier airlines in Denver knew that we would not be able to make the connection and told me that the Albuquerque Frontier station frequently tells customers that they will be able to make connections that are not possible in an effort to get them out of Albuquerque to be someone else's problem. I had the 'pleasure' of sleeping in the Denver airport overnight because staff in Denver said that they were not liable for putting me up in a hotel.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,My 2 older children had a flight from DIA to Grand Rapids and they sat in the airport for 6 hours before Frontier cancelled the flight. The were rebooked for the following morning. We arrived at 6 am flight just to be informed that flight was cancelled. We received no compensation or upgrades for the inconvenience. They rebooked us for what was our original 2 hour flight tomorrow to fly 4 hours to Houston 3 hour layover and then another 4 hours to Detroit - not their airport of origin. I have 4 children returning 12/28 on Frontier what are the chances they will all make it?
,,,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,,,2,no,,My wife and I flew Frontier on a whim since it was our honeymoon and they offered a non-stop flight. The flight to our destination was uneventful even pleasant. On the return the ticket staff were incredibly rude. We paid additional for the both of us to sit together in the middle of the aircraft however when we arrived we were seated at opposite ends of the plane. After spending an hour trying to get the issue resolved we had to resign ourselves to the back of the plane negating the extra money we spent for preferred seating.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Awful experience ticket agent was very rude. Our flight had been moved to another day without notifying us the ticket agent said it was not his problem and we needed to contact the other airlines to find a flight to Orlando. He finally did find us a flight on American and it was already boarding so we had to run to catch the plane our option to fly home was stay an extra day in Orlando which we could not do or fly from Orlando to Denver to Madison WI which we had to do. Fly another airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,We flew to Puna Canta. Attendants were friendly and attentive we were celebrating our 50th anniversary and enjoyed the trip there and back. Impressed with the cleanliness of the bathrooms and the room in them. Hope to fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Depending on which rules they choose to enforce you can never be assured that you will be granted access to their boarding process. I am a young woman with a certified disability. I live 4 hours from Oklahoma airport and after waiting on the check in line presented my travel documents 4 minutes late according to their boarding rules. I was not allowed to check in for my scheduled flight. I was re-routed to an intermediary city where I had to spend the night before catching a flight to my final destination. Do not fly this airline especially if you have children or special needs!
,,,,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Booked one way GSO-MCO Nov 26th. Few minutes late leaving and arriving but no problem. Cabin staff friendly and competent. Plane clean and IFE working. Thanks Frontier for bringing low cost full size plane service to GSO.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,Very disappointed with Frontier Airlines service on our trip out to visit family for Thanksgiving. They did not make traveling with two young children easy (1 toddler 1 infant). We selected seats together at the airport we could not sit together because we didn't pay the extra $5 fee for the opportunity to select seats. So we pay the upgrade for the 1st leg of our flight but they keep us in separate rows and seats for the second leg. With a 2.5 year old and an 8 month old we're all going to sit in separate seats? I highly dissuade any families from using Frontier. We flew home on United and had no problems whatsoever sitting together.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,1,"I had a combined round-trip ticket flying American from Tulsa to Denver then Frontier to Minneapolis; coming back was the reverse Frontier out of Minneapolis then American to Tulsa. It was ticketed through American. Flying to Minneapolis was fine because I didn't really have to interact with checking in at Frontier. However the return was horrible. I arrived at the airport later than I planned but still had a half hour before takeoff when I tried to check in at the Frontier counter. The attendant wouldn't let me check in because he said I wouldn't make it in time. I had a half hour but he wouldn't even let me try. I asked if there was anything he could do and he said no. Other airlines have been known to call the gate tell them the passenger was on the way and ask them to hold the plane. But not Frontier. He was also unwilling to help me get on a later flight because ""it's ticketed through American let them help you"". I went to the American desk. They were very friendly and tried to help. However it would cost $150 to change my ticket and fly from Minneapolis with them so they suggested I go back to the Frontier desk and ask them to sign my ticket over to American. The attendant would not help me and rudely said it was my fault because I was late. But he finally said they could put me on standby on the next plane which would leave 4 hours later but said it was full so my chances weren't good. I went back to American and paid my $150. From now on I will pay a little more to deal with a friendly helpful person."
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,,We were supposed to leave on a 1.12 flight to Denver and our plane had started boarding when an announcement was made that there may be an aircraft change. There was - the plane headed to Harrisburg directly across from our gate started deboarding and got on our plane and took off. Here we sit 3 hours after we were supposed to leave with another 5 hour wait before we can leave. What I don't understand is why we had to sacrifice our plane and time for the folks going to Harrisburg. It's a huge inconvenience. We will never fly with Frontier again.
,,,,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,no,,Flew Frontier 3 times this week (Denver to Phoenix 11/16 Phoenix to Denver 11/17 and Denver to Dallas 11/24). This was the first time I had used this carrier. Not a single flight left on time average delay on each flight was 2-3 hours (always blamed on mechanical delays). I understand being delayed once in a while but 3 out of 3? Also staff (from the baggage checker to flight attendants) were grouchy and the customer service reps essentially told me too bad (never once apologized for the inconvenience). I fly a fair amount (20+ times per year) and have been on almost all major US carriers this one takes the cake as the worst!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,,I flew from Austin TX to Portland OR changing both ways in Denver CO. On all 4 planes the aisles were so narrow that it was difficult to even enter the plane. The planes seem to have been changed from 5-seat rows to 6-seat rows and additional rows added. This meant that the seats were so close together that the experience was like being a sardine in a can. When the stewards were passing out drinks on one flight they parked the cart by my row and served the whole plane from there. When the passenger in front of me lowered their seat they were in my lap. Never again will I fly Frontier.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Will never fly Frontier again. Was on 4 different flights and were only greeted twice by flight attendants. Made arrangements in April for a November trip and had no choice of seats at reservation time only to be told at check in you will get your seat at the gate. Gate staff were rude. We had a first time flyer with us and nicely asked if she could be seated with one of us so she wasn't alone. Only to be told we were lucky to be on this flight. The 4 of us were separated on all the flights we were on. When you're flying for over 3 hours it would be nice to sit with someone you know.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Denver to Dayton to visit family in Ohio. Have flown Frontier many times before staff have always been courteous and apart from when I've flown home in the winter the flights have been on time. I have a direct flight so don't know about connecting flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Flew from Orange County to Detroit with a stop in Denver. Boarding in Orange County was fine was seated at the very back of the plane which I hate but that is the luck of the draw. Flight started with flight attendant saying the TV system was broken for the flight . Beverage cart came around giving us a shot glass of Pop. Landed in Denver 15 minutes late. Only had 15 minutes to catch my next flight which was 7 minute away from gate to gate. Being at the very back of the plane killed another 5 minutes. We rushed (with no assistance from the airlines) to our connecting flight and was made to feel like it was our fault when arriving at the next plane for holding up the flight. Never even looked at our boarding passes just ordered us on the plane. Why would they put us at the very back of the plane on the first flight when we had a tight connection like that. I booked over a month in advance. Second flight to the very back of the plane again. Air did not work in our seats and when asked attendant about it she brushed it off in addition the seats do not go back when you are in the last row which made it tight. Then the TV came on and was disappointed we had the pay $5.99 if we wanted to watch it. Overall very uncomfortable flight with rude attendants. I flew AA a week earlier and had a great experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0,no,,Even though I booked round trip tickets with Frontier I never once got on an actual plane the departing flight was cancelled altogether and the return flight was delayed so long that the connection would have been impossible to make. Making matters worse I was flying to my sister's wedding in California from Michigan and could not afford to wait for following day much less trust that it would go. So they rebooked myself and my daughter on a flight from Detroit to Washington/Dulles then after hurrying to the connecting gate we flew clear across the continental US something like 5 straight hours. Not much fun to say the least. Coming home we were forced to layover an extra day so my 5 day trip turned into a six day trip with three days spent entirely at airports. As far as this review goes I can't give an opinion because I never got on their plane! My sister booked my niece on the same flight so the same thing happened to her except they rebooked her on US Airways and she flew from DTW to Phoenix but never made her connection to California.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,2,I will never fly Frontier again. The staff were rude and made us very uncomfortable. They were not helpful at the baggage check in this was in PHX on the morning of Sep 12th. On our connecting flight going to Nashville one of the flight attendants snapped at me when I asked where the restroom was. Their lack of customer service made my experience lousy. On our way back we took United Airlines. Totally different.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Overall I was very satisfied. Online booking was smooth I had no problems boarding and the flight left and arrived on time in Denver. I flew from Salt Lake to Little Rock to visit family and I might have to push my return date out so I am curious as to how smooth that will go. The drinks on flight were a small cup with ice the food was expensive and so were alcoholic drinks so I refrained from those. I would recommend this flight and would also add that more leg room would be nice.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,My flight to Colorado Springs with connection at Denver was delayed which in turn made me miss my connection flight. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to fly the next day at 8 am. We were told that they were holding flights when in fact my connection flight left 7 minutes earlier than suppose to. This is the last time I fly Frontier. I was told by another flyer that this happens way to frequent and he was driving from Denver to Colorado Springs. This was my first time flying alone to this airport. They have made this a bad experience. This airline needs to get their act together.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,I was travelling with my 4 year old. My flight to Portland with connection at Denver was delayed 3 hours. First they said it was due to weather but then they said it was a mechanical problem with the flight. I was to miss my connection at Denver. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to either stay back at Denver or fly the next day at 9 am. The next day they were so fuzzy about my baggage being overweight by 1 pound - the same bag they checked in yesterday but had to get back due to flight delay. They made me remove stuff from my bag and finally they lost my bag. Staff at Portland responsible for baggage claim was impossible. I am still waiting for my baggage to arrive and I am hoping I would get it back.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,Portland-Denver-Jackson Hole in A320/A319. Smooth online booking online check-in and bag drop Flights on time and the service efficient. Seats in the cheapest part of the plane offered as much legroom as premium airlines' Economy. A non-alcoholic drink was served on each leg (no free snack). The hub at Denver was quite crowded and busy. Luggage took a long time to be unloaded at Jackson Hole. Overall a good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,I flew to Portland OR from NYC via Denver. Outbound trip was great. On the way back on DEN-LGA leg of the journey the pilot made an emergency landing in Indianapolis. The next 16 hours is a case study in trying to buy off customers for poor quality service. Instead of having enough people on the ground to service the accommodation of 150+ passengers the airline effectively paid the passengers to struggle through the limited resources available on the ground in Indianapolis to assist them. I ended up sleeping the night in a cold airport lounge and slogged through multiple re-scheduling of the continuation of my trip from Indianapolis to NYC. I tore up the $400 airline voucher I got for the inconvenience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,"I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. ""If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements."" After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent. I feel that it is ridiculous that I have to go on Frontier's website and show it to Frontier agents in order for anything to happen."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,no,1,We (5 people) travelled from GEG to DEN on 08/03/12. I was travelling with my disabled daughter in a wheelchair. During reservation I had already informed them that my daughter is in a wheelchair and cannot walk. We checked in online and after going through security arrived at gate C32. After the gate agent arrived I reminded her that we need an aisle chair. She said that as per 'normal' Frontier procedure when travelling with a wheelchair passenger I should have checked in at the counter and not online. I never saw this instruction on their website. She also mentioned that they can deny us boarding for not doing that. I did complain about this to the airline and they rewarded me the with a whopping $25 certificate per passenger that can only be used for 'future' travel on this customer un-friendly airline. Frontier provides only complementary beverage no food.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,"I just returned from a trip with Frontier Airlines and I hope it is the last time I need to travel with them. Unlike other reviewers we were not offered a cookie with our drink. We had a delay of 6 hours which was not Frontier's fault however people were tired. A nice gesture would have been to offer flyers a whole can of Pepsi not just the usual half ice and half drink that all airlines offer after the wait was over. Instead we had one steward who was not rude but obviously tired. Frontier like most airlines does charge. Their term for this is ""excess baggage"" when you check it in. It's not excess it's your luggage bag. However what I was amazed about was Frontier staff kept announcing before the flight that the flight was full and you should check your roll-on baggage before boarding. In both cases where I saw this done many people did check their roll ons and there was lots of space in the overhead bins. This was a DC to Denver to Billings MT round trip."
,,,,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,All in all pretty good experience. Flights were on time check in was smooth as were the flights. Flight attendants were great. The only cons were the planes were small and cramped especially on the Denver to Spokane leg. We paid extra for Classic Plus and felt like our knees were under our chins undoubtedly due to the aircraft type and the fact that three seats were squeezed into an area probably meant for two. We were shoulder to shoulder in the three row seating and both of us are small and thin. I imagine it would be even more miserable for people who are normal sized or a little overweight. It wasn't as bad on our return flight but it wasn't full and we had an empty seat in our row. The saving grace for Frontier at least as far as we were concerned was the courtesy of the staff at the airports and the personable flight attendants.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,5,SEA-DEN-OKC-DEN-OKC. Overall service was really good. Had a huge delay from DEN-OKC due to crew scheduling issues but other 3 legs were on time. Food selection was adequate for these flight duration's but the aircraft interiors need to be refreshed. With that said seats on 3 of the 4 legs were uncomfortable due to high wear and tear. IFE was not free like Virgin America or JetBlue. It's terrible how the US airlines are charging for everything now it's getting ridiculous.
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flight: In last month. Just returned last night to Anchorage. I used my Early Returns miles and took my family to ATL via DEN. All aspects of our trip were great on Frontier. We did takeoff 40 minutes late from DEN on our return but somehow managed to arrive 20 min's early into Anchorage. The planes were fine the service excellent and staff attitudes were quite positive. No problems and no complaints! I will fly them again soon!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew from La Guardia to Denver. Flight took off 40 minutes late but otherwise a pretty pleasant experience. Newish Airbus with comfortable leather seats decent legroom and direct TV screens in seatbacks. Crew was OK but unremarkable. I'd fly them again and consider them one of the better options in my market.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,"I purchased a round trip Minneapolis to Santa Barbara 4 months in advance. I did not specifically look at the aisle seating I was assigned and 3 out of 4 legs I was seated just in front of the exit row and could not recline my seat (Row 10). 3 out of 4 legs were on an Embraer 190 which is a nice plane but no storage. Last leg on Airbus 320 had the most cramped seating I've experienced. They gate checked my bag half way through boarding letting the last 20 folks bring on their bags. When I asked the flight attendant what was going on she said they ""pre-emptively"" gate check bags when they have few checked bags for a full flight. Bottom line is that Frontier is not customer friendly. They will survive on price alone and they won't get my business unless I'm desperate."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,,,3,no,2,"LIR (Costa Rica)-DEN-LAX. Sat on the runway in CR for a 1.5 hours due to ""paperwork issues"". They wouldn't let us on our connecting flight (we made it 30 mins before departure) stating our luggage wouldn't make it on. They rebooked us to a United flight who charged us for luggage. Not a pleasant experience - will never fly them again."
,,,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew round trip from Minneapolis to Las Vegas via Denver. Staff very friendly and the overall experience was fantastic. I recommend upgrading to Classic Plus - it is well worth the extra money!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew roundtrip from Denver to San Diego return to Denver. Staff were friendly helping us with checking baggage. Boarding was easy boarded early due to no carry on bags. Flight staff friendly and efficient trying to get everyone's carry on bags stored. Seats were comfortable and had plenty of room. The TV was good had to pay for it but it was affordable. All of our bags made it to our destination. The return trip to Denver was just as pleasant the plane not very full so attendants let us change seats.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,ATL-DEN. Arrived on time however the boarding ramp would not work so had to wait 30 min for technicians to fix it before we could exit the plane. On the return DEN-ATL we sat on the runway for an hour because the plane had a malfunction. Finally unloaded off the plane just to be told to wait for another to arrive in 30 min. We arrive in ATL airport to find out the shuttles have been shut down for the night and that we would have to take buses to the baggage claim. Total delay 3 hours!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,My flight from DCA-MKE was delayed 1.5 hrs. In MKE my flight to DFW was cancelled due to the fact that they did not have any staff available. There were only 10 seats available on flights going to DFW for the next 2 days. Overall the worst flying experience I have had. My first and last time using this carrier.
